                    June 15, 1961, a revision of the order approved on March 26, 1925, by Mr. Frank
                    B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the current regulation is
                    printed below:</p>

                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States,
                        Diplomatic Papers</hi>, constitutes the official record of the foreign
                    policy of the United States. These volumes include, subject to necessary
                    security considerations, all documents needed to give a comprehensive record of
                    the major foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities, together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which
                    contributed to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                    supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                    understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers should
                    be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                        >Foreign Relations of the United States, Diplomatic Papers</hi>, shall be
                    edited by the Historical Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the Department of
                    State. The editing of the record shall be guided by the principles of historical
                    objectivity. There shall be no alteration of the text, no deletions without
                    indicating where in the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts
                    which were of major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing shall be omitted
                    for the purpose of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as
                    a defect of policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for

                            friendship and support by Japan for Chile. He also stressed strategic
                            importance of Easter Island. It seems probable that similar talks were
                            given in other key South American countries on the eve of Conference at

                            Metals Reserve contract.<note n="8" xml:id="d2fn8">For correspondence on
                                the acquisition of strategic materials by the United States from

                        </p>
                        <p>Del Pedregal used this occasion to say to me with the appearance of the
                            greatest feeling that if Chile had military equipment she would not only
                            be willing to break relations but would go to war with the Axis. He said
                            that the Army had ammunition for about 15 minutes of fighting and no
                            planes or anti-aircraft guns. He said that the Japanese Minister assured
                            him that if Chile maintained its neutral position she would not be
                            attacked by Japan. He agreed with the objection that this assurance from
                            an Axis nation meant nothing and said that Japan would attack to suit
                            her convenience. However, he said that if it restrained Japan from
                            attacking one ship that was clear gain in Chile’s present defenseless
                            position. He went on to say that the people of Chile were all for
                            solidarity of action and for fulfilling their obligations but as [<hi
                                rend="italic">that?</hi>] they were not prepared for sudden action
                            against the Axis unless some dramatic incident occurred to wake them up.
                            He deplored this attitude but [said] that it was general throughout
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The only thing I can see to break this attitude for Chile is to have you
                            after consultation with our War and Navy Departments give categorical
                            assurances to Rossetti<note n="9" xml:id="d2fn9">Juan B. Rossetti,
                                Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> and through me to the
                            Chilean Government that the United States is prepared instantly to send
                            down sufficient reconnaissance planes and fighters to ensure protection
                            for the vulnerable strategic coast points of Chile notably the oil
                            deposit at San Antonio, copper power plants at Coya and Tocopilla, et
                            cetera. Airplanes and personnel sent might be ostensible addition to the
                            training equipment of the United States Air Mission in Chile and also to
                            the three navy flying boats now visiting Valparaiso; if it is possible
                            to couple with assurances of the instant despatch of minimum need of
                            defense equipment the firm opinion of our Navy and Army authorities that
                            for some time to come Japan will be incapable of anything except a hit
                            and run aerial attack or submarine activity against Chile this would
                            help. On this basis I would try to persuade the Vice President<note

                        <p>118. The following telegram has been sent to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>January 20, 11 p.m. For the Under Secretary. Supplementing my telegram of
                            today, (paraphrase), repeated to the Department under No. 117, January
                            20, 10 p.m. Colonel Niergarth, Chief of Military Air Mission here, in a
                            report to General Miles,<note n="11" xml:id="d3fn11">Brig. Gen. Sherman
                                Miles, Assistant Chief of Staff.</note> sent to the Department by
                            air today said, in substance, the following with regard to Chilean
                            defense needs:</p>
                        <p>Whenever mentioning the electric plants at Tocopilla, Coya and Barquitos
                            powering the Chilean copper production which we so urgently need,
                            Niergarth said if these important objectives along some 800 miles of
                            Chilean coast down to Pall (aviation gas tanks) could have an off shore
                            patrol 500 miles to sea he believes a surprise attack could be avoided.
                            He personally thinks that Japan when it suits her convenience would make
                            a hit and run aerial attack against these points which at present could
                            be done with impunity. After the attack the United States would be able
                            to find planes for an off shore patrol, so why not make an effort and
                            provide them before the attack. The Axis will, he believes, not launch a
                            major attack on the United States before trying to get control of our
                            outposts of which Chile is one. Therefore, the majority of our combat
                            planes should be in the outposts. He recommends that under Lend
                                Lease<note n="12" xml:id="d3fn12">Act approved March 11, 1941; 55

                            range reconnaissance land planes be turned over to Chile for off shore
                            patrol duty.</p>
                        <p>I am not in a position to give an estimate as to minimum naval assistance
                            required by Chile at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my telegram under reference it does not appear at present to
                            be a matter of land fighting equipment but a prompt answer should be
                            given to the Chilean Chief of Staff’s<note n="13" xml:id="d3fn13">Gen.

                        <p>My telegram No. 118, January 20, 11 p.m. The following is the revised
                            estimate of the United States Air Mission here of the minimum number of
                            planes and anti-aircraft guns needed to make a possibly successful
                            showing against surprise air attack from the Japanese on the strategic
                            points along an 800 mile Chilean coastal stretch: 12 long range bombing
                            reconnaissance planes. Preferably 36 but at least 24 interceptor pursuit
                            planes. Forty-two 20-millimeter antiaircraft guns and twenty-one
                            37-millimeter anti-aircraft. It would be necessary to have full American
                            combat and maintenance crews at least for the first few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Could you promise immediate arrival of such equipment?</p>

                        <p>136. I must respectfully submit that the material listed in the
                            Department’s No. 80, January 21, 10 p.m. is not responsive to my
                            telegrams referred to therein. The Chilean Air Force and Army would be
                            delighted to get this training and other equipment, of course, but it in
                            no way meets the immediate danger of a Japanese hit-and-run air attack.
                            If you could give assurances of the immediate (repeat immediate)
                            delivery of the material specified in my No. 120 of January 21, 2 a.m. I
                            believe it would decisively clinch full Chilean cooperation. The view
                            here is Japan will not wait until Chile actually breaks off relations.
                            One airplane could now wipe out the Potrerillos Power Plant, utterly
                            unprotected by combat planes or anti-aircraft guns, thus stopping
                            production for months of an important source of our supply of
                            copper.</p>
                        <p>Our Air Corps Command has apparently not been able to grasp the military
                            and political significance of South America and particularly the utter
                            vulnerability of Chile. If something should happen now to Chile in her
                            present defenseless situation it is going to throw our whole policy out
                            of gear and our relations will be adversely affected for a very long
                            time to come since it will be said that we urged Chile to take a step
                            which it felt was unwise. My impression is that the allocation authority
                            of the Air Corps Command apparently still thinks we are back in 1940
                            when they were shipping everything to England. I think it will be found
                            that there are bomber and pursuit units in the interior of the United
                            States for which no combat use is anticipated in the near future.</p>
                        <p>I believe the matter should be taken up directly with General Arnold<note

                            recent telegrams from Ambassador Bowers urging that certain military and
                            naval matériel immediately be made available to Chile in order to put it
                            in a position to repel the aggression from Japan it appears so much to
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0020"/>fear. The War and Navy
                            Departments reviewed their supply situation and authorized me to send a
                            telegram setting forth a list of matériel which could be made available
                            either immediately or in the near future. Mr. Bowers has now sent a
                            message indicating his opinion that the list is entirely inadequate and
                            urging further reconsideration of the situation. It does not seem to me
                            that Mr. Bowers appreciates the exceedingly heavy demands which are now
                            being made on our war production or that the War and Navy Departments,
                            at your direction, made a real effort to furnish to Chile whatever they
                            could spare.</p>

                        <p>98. From the President.</p>
                        <p>“I have given the most careful personal consideration to the Chilean
                            military and naval situation as described in your various communications
                            to the Secretary of State. I fully appreciate the necessity for doing
                            everything possible to enable Chile to resist attack from any of the
                            Axis countries. Considerations both of hemisphere defense and of the
                            importance to our own war effort of Chilean strategic materials make
                            this obvious.</p>
                        <p>The materials listed in the telegram transmitted to you on January 21 by
                            the Department of State were made available at my orders after
                            consultation with General Marshall.<note n="19" xml:id="d8fn19">Gen.
                                George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, United States Army.</note> You
                            appreciate, I am confident, that the demand for war matériel for actual
                            war use is very great, not only by our own Army and Navy but by the
                            nations now fighting with us day and night. Production is increasing
                            rapidly, however, and more materials will be forwarded to Chile just as
                            soon as they become available.</p>
                        <p>It would be inexcusable to disregard the possibility of a Japanese
                            hit-and-run attack on Chile. On the other hand, it would be equally
                            inexcusable to suppose that any Japanese plan for such an attack <pb
                                n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0021"/>would be in any way affected by the
                            particular state of Chile’s diplomatic or other relations with Japan at
                            the time. Therefore, I hope that the ‘full Chilean cooperation’
                            mentioned in your telegram 136<note n="20" xml:id="d8fn20">January 22, 9
                                p.m., <ref target="#pg_5">p. 5</ref>.</note> will be immediately
                            forthcoming, since it will be a most valuable contribution to the
                            placing of both our countries in the best possible position to meet all
                            eventualities. Signed Franklin D. Roosevelt”</p>

                                <p>“Meeting together, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile, Dr.
                                    Juan B. Rossetti, and the Under Secretary of State of the United
                                    States of America, Mr. Sumner Welles, have considered the
                                    requirements of continental defense, and particularly the
                                    requirements of Chile to defend its long coastline in view of
                                    the situation created by the fact that the United States has
                                    been the victim of an aggression by a non-American state, that
                                    ten of the American Republics are at war with the Axis powers,
                                    and that the Meeting of Foreign Ministers at Rio has agreed to a
                                    resolution recommending that all the American Republics sever
                                    their relations with the Axis.</p>
                                <p>In view of the circumstances set forth by Minister Rossetti, the
                                    Under Secretary of State, Mr. Welles, declared that, in accord
                                    with unequivocal assurances to go to the assistance of any
                                    nation of the Western Hemisphere which has been the victim of
                                    non-American aggression, the United States, in the event of an
                                    attack by a non-American country against Chile, will take
                                    immediate steps to send naval, air and land forces to repulse
                                    this aggression. In the meantime, precautionary defense measures
                                    have been taken to render as unlikely as possible attack upon
                                    the coastline of Chile. The War and Navy Departments would
                                    welcome further opportunity to discuss amplification and
                                    implementation of the conversations previously held with the
                                    appropriate officers of the Chilean Government.”</p>

                        <p>The President, who was consulted with respect to your telegram, thought
                            that you should point out to Rossetti that the United States has
                            undertaken and expects to carry forward, with the assistance of the
                            other American republics concerned, the defense of a seaboard on the
                            Pacific of 10,000 miles; that since we do not have enough ships to
                            locate <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0022"/>them for patrol duty
                            immediately off the coast of each country, they are being located in
                            such areas as to derive the maximum utility; and that in the execution
                            of our assurances of support, which have been made to all countries on
                            the same basis, due account will, of course, be given to the special
                            geographical situation, the importance of the country as a source of the
                            production of strategic materials, and any other special factors. The
                            President has made it very clear, however, that Chile cannot anticipate
                            any preference over any other American republic in the protection we can
                            afford, which, as stated above, will take into account all pertinent
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department suggests that you should also further remind the
                            Chilean Foreign Minister that this Government expects Chile will make
                            all possible military efforts herself to defend her territory and
                            offshore waters and will protect friendly shipping near the Chilean
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>As Rossetti undoubtedly understands, until Chile signs a lend-lease
                            agreement no deliveries of war materials can be made.</p>

                        <p>In conversation with the Chilean Ambassador<note n="23" xml:id="d10fn23"
                                >Rodolfo Michels.</note> on January 26, mention was made that
                            Rossetti had not signed an agreement with Argentina on the Straits of
                            Magellan, during his visit to Buenos Aires, and I stated, in a
                            questioning tone, that probably Rossetti would continue the matter when
                            passing through Buenos Aires en route home.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador did not confirm that the agreement would then be
                            completed, but said that he did not feel that fortification of these
                            Straits was very important, for ships could go around Cape Horn with
                            only one day’s travel additional required to that via the Straits of
                            Magellan. The use of the Straits, he said, was necessary in the days of
                            sailing ships, but modern powered vessels could easily round the Horn
                            without danger.</p>

                        <p>Have just had a talk with Rossetti who urged that any war material to be
                            sent should arrive coincident with reopening of Congress last week in
                            February to consider Rio resolution for breaking relations with Axis
                            Powers. Properly publicized here this should help remove opposition to
                            ratification. Rossetti said however that if any American military
                            personnel accompanies material this fact should be carefully handled and
                            it should be emphasized that they were merely coming for temporary
                            training purposes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Government has been giving careful consideration to the problem of
                            cooperating with the Chilean Government in the cause of hemisphere
                            defense by affording additional protection to certain important
                            localities in Chile, and is pleased to state that if the Chilean
                            Government should so request in writing, stating that it has learned of
                            the availability of this material and of its utility for coast defense
                            purposes, the War Department is prepared to ship to Chile about February
                            15 for delivery to the Chilean Government 4 batteries (16 guns) of
                            155-millimeter cannon with 300 rounds of ammunition per gun. It is
                            believed that they would be most advantageously set up at Antofagasta,
                            Tocopilla, Barquitos, and San Antonio.</p>
                        <p>Each battery of guns will be accompanied by a detachment of approximately
                            300 men which is the number of men assigned to operate these batteries
                            in the United States. The efficient and maximum handling of these guns
                            requires an integrated military setup. For each battery there are
                            battery headquarters, gun squads, ammunition squads, searchlight
                            platoon, medical detachment, fire control detail <pb n="10"
                                xml:id="pg_10" facs="0024"/>including isolated observation posts, a
                            communications squad, a maintenance squad, et cetera. In other words,
                            the proper operation of these guns is a highly technical and complex
                            military operation necessitating the careful coordination and
                            integration of a number of separate military functions. The United
                            States detachments will go prepared to give immediately full instruction
                            in all aspects of the operation of the guns. They will carry with them,
                            in addition to the 300 rounds of ammunition per gun, sufficient
                            ammunition for the training of Chilean detachments. The War Department
                            suggests that the Chilean Military will fully appreciate the necessity
                            of sending along detachments of approximately 300 men for the proper
                            handling of these guns.</p>
                        <p>In addition to training the Chilean personnel, the duty of these
                            detachments will be to emplace the guns and to render such protection as
                            is possible until the Chilean forces are sufficiently trained to assume
                            this duty. The American detachments will be withdrawn whenever the
                            Chilean Government considers its own forces sufficiently well trained to
                            take over.</p>
                        <p>The Commander of these troops is Colonel Sackville whose headquarters
                            would be at Santiago. The regimental headquarters organization consists
                            of 18 officers and 177 men which the War Department would like to have
                            located at Santiago. They would be placed under the supervision of the
                            United States Military Mission to Chile. The War Department, however,
                            recommends that in order to facilitate Colonel Sackville’s task, he be
                            appointed Military Attaché during the period of his stay in Chile. The
                            salaries and other expenses of these troops would be met by the War
                            Department. Other administrative matters will be communicated to you
                            later when necessary.</p>
                        <p>Please place this matter personally and confidentially before
                            President-elect Ríos and ascertain his views as to whether he wishes
                            this offer to be made formally to the Chilean Government at this time.
                            If his reply is affirmative, you will state that the early signing of
                            the basic lend-lease agreement by the Chilean Government would greatly
                            facilitate the delivery of the material, should the Chilean Government
                            desire to acquire it under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act.
                            Otherwise it would be necessary to follow a less convenient procedure
                            and one which would be less advantageous from the Chilean point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>Please also ascertain Ríos’ views regarding the location of the
                            headquarters battery.</p>

                        <p>139. Department’s 80, January 21, 10 p.m. Please inform the Chilean
                            Government at the earliest opportunity that the Government of the United
                            States will be glad in the interest of hemisphere defense to make
                            available 15 AT–6 advanced training planes, together with a pilot and
                            co-pilot for each plane who would remain for the purpose of giving such
                            instruction to the Chilean troops as may seem desirable. These planes
                            are effective combat aircraft for oversea missions as each carries three
                            .30 caliber machine guns and four 100 pound bombs. The ammunition would
                            be forwarded by ship. The Under Secretary of State discussed this matter
                            with the Chilean representatives at Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>The planes are now in the United States and can leave for Chile about
                            February 20. Deliveries can be made at Arica, Antofagasta or Santiago.
                            The War Department requests to be informed as to which of these places
                            the planes should be sent.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the payment for these aircraft, you may state that if
                            the Chilean Government should desire to include them among the equipment
                            which that Government may be planning to acquire under the provisions of
                            the Lease-Lend Act, the signing of the basic agreement would greatly
                            facilitate the delivery of these planes. Otherwise it would be necessary
                            to follow a less convenient procedure.</p>
                        <p>During their stay in Chile the crews of these planes would be under the
                            supervision of the United States Military Aviation Mission until the
                            equipment is transferred to trained Chilean crews.</p>
                        <p>Please request an early reply to this offer owing to the urgent demands
                            for planes of this type.</p>

                        <p>It was impossible to see Rossetti until 6:30 this afternoon. At first he
                            expressed enthusiasm over the project and said he would endeavor to give
                            the Embassy a definite answer by tomorrow afternoon. Reflecting <pb
                                n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0026"/>however upon the large number
                            according to Chilean military standards, of the training crews
                            accompanying the batteries, he expressed concern and said it would be
                            impossible for him to answer before noon Monday February 9 although he
                            realized that the matter was urgent.</p>
                        <p>One cause of delay is the visit of the Panamanian Foreign Minister whom
                            Rossetti is accompanying to Valparaiso tomorrow. He stressed the vital
                            necessity of keeping the project confidential here and by inference in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>He also asked whether a part of the crews could be in civilian clothes.
                            While he avoided giving a definite answer to the proposal his final
                            [statement?] was “have confidence”.</p>
                        <p>Rossetti said that he had no intention of submitting the proposal to Ríos
                            at this time and indicated very clearly he thought it would be impudent
                            to do so. He said he wanted to be able to tell him at the proper time
                            “we are armed”.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the ratification of the proposal for the breaking of
                            relations, he said that the present Government would push this through
                            on their own before Ríos assumes office and while they would not make it
                            public, stated ratification would have his tacit approval.</p>
                        <p>We are seeing Rossetti again this evening.</p>

                        <p>253. Following a meeting of a Chilean Council of Defense which lasted
                            most of the day Rossetti said to us that the Government of Chile
                            accepted all the stipulations made in the offer of planes and batteries
                            with the exception of the number of officers and men accompanying the
                            batteries which could not exceed 100. He insisted that the Chilean Army
                            and Navy had assured him that its personnel were fully competent to set
                            up and operate the batteries without outside assistance. Ten instructors
                            per battery would be ample. However, as a special concession to our
                            point of view they would take 100. He says that Chile needed the
                            batteries and was fully aware of the danger of her position and in fact
                            tomorrow would raise the size of the Eleventh Army from 12,000 to 50,000
                            and would fortify 30 vulnerable points on the coast. They would accept
                            the location of the four batteries we had proposed but would appreciate
                            a fifth battery to protect coal mines at Lota. All points mentioned in
                            Department’s instructions in this matter in addition to other technical
                            arguments suggested by our advisors were used <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13"
                                facs="0027"/>but Rossetti insisted that, however foolish it might
                            be, it was impossible in view of Chilean psychology at this time to
                            permit any except extremely limited number of foreign military advisors
                            to enter upon Chilean soil. He insisted that material from Germany and
                            the Chilean battleship purchased from England had been taken over and
                            set in operation by the Chilean personnel.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Government was still planning to call a special session
                            of Congress for the end of the month or the very first days of March but
                            that he could not and would not ask for ratification of the resolution
                            rupture of relations without this material.</p>
                        <p>He pleaded that the United States furnish the material and asked us to
                            have confidence in the Chilean Army and in the Chilean Government. He
                            said if it were a question of lack of belief in the ability of the
                            Chilean Army to put the batteries immediately into operation, to let it
                            try with one battery—and 25 American instructors—and he was certain the
                            trial would prove his contentions. He said he was sending a personal
                            message immediately to Welles.</p>
                        <p>After seeing Rossetti we saw General Escudero who expressed understanding
                            of our point of view but said that in view of the unpreparedness of
                            Chilean public opinion the despatch of a large detachment might imperil
                            ratification of the resolution for rupture of relations. He remarked
                            that had Ríos been actually in office that the Government might have
                            been able to accept a larger detachment but that as President elect, he
                            thought, Ríos would be unwilling to attempt to reverse the decision.</p>

                        <p>169. Your 253, February 12, 10 p.m. The War Department has reluctantly
                            agreed to send the four batteries to Chile, accompanied by 100 enlisted
                            men. In addition, it will be necessary for administrative and other
                            reasons to assign two officers to each battery, making a grand total of
                            108 officers and men.</p>
                        <p>The Department is aware of the various considerations which have induced
                            the Chilean Government to take the stand it has taken with regard to the
                            number of men. It must be stated that, as a result of the decision now
                            taken by our War Department at the request of the Chilean Government,
                            the batteries during the first few months after their arrival in Chile
                            will be of considerably less value for defense purposes than if they had
                            been manned from the start by experienced personnel. The Chilean
                            Government has, therefore, incurred an extremely grave responsibility
                            under all the circumstances. Please make <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14"
                                facs="0028"/>this entirely repeat entirely clear to the Foreign
                            Minister, preferably in writing.</p>
                        <p>At the present time only four batteries are available for Chile. The
                            possibility at a later date of providing a fifth battery for Lota will
                            be borne in mind.</p>
                        <p>Arrangements are being expedited to send the batteries forward and it is
                            hoped that they may arrive early in March.<note n="27" xml:id="d16fn27"

                        <p>266. For the Under Secretary. From a most reliable source I was informed
                            today that the Japanese Minister called on Señor Rossetti and told him
                            that Japan planned sending a convoyed flotilla to Chile for the purpose
                            of purchasing copper, nitrate and manganese at good prices. Señor
                            Rossetti informed the Minister that all Chile’s raw materials had
                            already been sold to the United States. The Minister then said that they
                            would bring much needed merchandise from Japan to sell to Chile and the
                            Foreign Minister told him that Chile lacked exchange. When the Japanese
                            Minister said that credits could be arranged Señor Rossetti said it
                            would not be convenient. The Japanese Minister asked what impression
                            would be made here by a Japanese attack on Panama. The Foreign Minister
                            told him that Chile would probably declare war immediately on Japan. The
                            Japanese Minister stated that Japan considered Panama as United States
                            territory. The Foreign Minister said that Chileans did not. The Japanese
                            Minister asked what would happen if Japan sank Peruvian merchantmen. The
                            Foreign Minister said it would make a very bad impression here as would
                            the sinking of any American boats or attack on any American soil. The
                            Japanese Minister admitted that there were Japanese submarines operating
                            in these waters. <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0029"/>He concluded by
                            saying that the Japanese campaign in the Orient would be completed by
                            April including the occupation of Australia and that after that time
                            Japan intended resuming her trade with South America. The Foreign
                            Minister was deeply impressed with the conversation of the Japanese
                            Minister.</p>

                        <p>176. From the Under Secretary. Your 266, February 14, 1 p.m. I am fully
                            aware of the kind of impression this sort of pressure tactics from the
                            Japanese make upon Rossetti.</p>
                        <p>You may state to Rossetti confidentially but officially that the
                            statement that Japanese submarines are operating in Western Hemisphere
                            waters south of the Panama Canal was an absolute falsehood. The
                            assertions contained in the penultimate sentence of your telegram are
                            typically boastful Japanese allegations which I believe will be fully
                            disproved in a relatively short time.</p>
                        <p>I only hope that Rossetti’s replies to the Japanese Minister were as
                            categorical as he has given you to understand.</p>
                        <p>I think it would be helpful for you on every possible occasion to
                            reiterate in the firmest manner our determination to assist in the
                            defense of Chile to the utmost extent necessary should any attack take
                            place. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>197. The extreme importance of Chilean copper and of Bolivian tungsten
                            and tin to the war effort of the United States and the associated powers
                            indicates the necessity of taking all precautions within our power to
                            protect the facilities for the mining and shipment of these strategic
                            minerals. Having in mind the Department’s previous instructions on this
                            subject and your numerous despatches, you are requested nevertheless to
                            submit a full and detailed report by air mail on preventive measures
                            already taken, embodying all information available to the Embassy and
                            other officials in Chile; and, in your discretion, to request the FBI
                            agents to make a careful personal investigation of conditions at the
                            important mines and respective ports, transport facilities, and power

                            national economy and of continental defense.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing, please ascertain what measures of
                            protection are being taken by the companies themselves, through

                            recognize the clear understanding that it is to be under Chilean Army
                            and insists that he will no doubt [have?] complete control and that he
                            will ship it back otherwise. General Díaz to my personal <pb n="17"
                                xml:id="pg_17" facs="0031"/>knowledge is an outstanding officer
                            usually very tactful and gentlemanly. It is the clear understanding of
                            the Chilean Government and of Cabrera that the Americans are here solely
                            to instruct in the use of the material.</p>
                        <p>Since an incident growing out of this dispute and possible publicity
                            would be of incalculable damage to us and of the greatest possible value
                            to our enemies, particularly at this time, I respectfully urge that the
                            matter be taken up at once with the War Department and appropriate
                            instructions sent Sackville.</p>

                        <p>306. Your 436, March 17, 9 p.m. The War Department has now sent Colonel
                            Sackville detailed instructions by both air mail and telegraph,
                            emphasizing the political considerations in this arrangement and the
                            necessity for eliminating all sources of friction. The War Department,
                            of course, assumes that in view of the instructional capacity of the
                            United States forces, the Chilean authorities will wish to provide them
                            with such limited administrative authority as may be necessary to
                            supervise the setting up of the batteries and the instruction of Chilean
                            forces in their operation. Anything beyond this authority over
                            mechanical operations would be presumably in the realm of tactical
                            jurisdiction. The War Department’s instructions to Sackville have been
                            summarized as follows for your information: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Each battery will operate under the immediate administrative
                                    jurisdiction and command of the senior U. S. Army officer
                                    present at each locality. For tactical functioning, all four
                                    batteries, under the command of Colonel Sackville, will be under
                                    the general supervision of the Commander in Chief of the Chilean
                                    Army, or his duly authorized representative at each locality. In
                                    case of any difficulty relative to the tactical control or
                                    disposition of his unit, final decision will rest with the
                                    Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army.”</p>

                        <p>478. General Escudero last night said that neither the Ministry of
                            Defense nor the army had been informed as to the agenda of the
                            Inter-American Defense Board meeting on March 30 (my No. 420, March 16,
                            2 p.m.<note n="29" xml:id="d24fn29">Not printed.</note>) and have been
                            unable to give instructions to the delegates. He said bitterly that it
                            had been the intention to send the Chiefs of Staff of the Chilean
                            military services but that the Chilean Ambassador in Washington had
                            stated that it was not contemplated that delegates be sent but rather
                            that Military Attachés and missions present in the states should act as
                            delegates. I am not anxious to encourage any bickering on this matter
                            between the Chilean Armed Forces and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
                            but Escudero has been a good friend and any information about the agenda
                            that I could discreetly transmit to him would be useful. I personally
                            regret that delegates were not sent from here because as a general rule
                            the more that go to the United States the more friends we have when they
                            return to Chile.</p>

                                succeeded Rossetti in this office after the inauguration of
                                President Juan Antonio Ríos on April 2, 1942.</note> this morning
                            and was told that the Japanese Minister struck out the reference to the
                            Panama Canal, and that he, Barros Jarpa, has called in the Japanese
                            Minister to say that Chile would look upon an attack on the Canal as an
                            attack on Chile since the economic life of Chile is dependent upon the
                            Canal. This is also what Rossetti told me he had said to the Minister.
                            Barros Jarpa showed me the original Japanese note pledging Japan not to
                            interfere with Chile’s commerce with the United States. This probably
                            means Chilean commerce conveyed in Chilean ships. It probably means that
                            submarine attacks on our own vessels may possibly be made but not on
                            Chilean, but Japan now knows that an attack on the Canal would be
                            considered by Chile an attack on herself.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State has received from a reliable source the following
                            strictly confidential information:</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Minister at Santiago is reported to have given the President
                            of Chile assurances that Chilean shipping will not be attacked by Japan.
                            The President of Chile, on his part, is understood to have informed the
                            Japanese Minister that Chile expects to maintain its neutral position
                            despite efforts of the United States and of certain Chilean Leftist
                            political elements to bring about a modification in Chilean policy to
                            one of closer cooperation with the United States in its war effort.</p>
                        <p>The President of Chile is also reported to have stated in this
                            conversation that he is opposed to sending a special representative of
                            the Chilean Government to Washington because he believes this might tend
                            to place Chile in the position of a vassal state. It is also understood
                            that the President of Chile informed the Japanese Minister that Chile
                            and Argentina had agreed upon a concerted plan of future action at the
                            time of the recent visit to Chile of the Argentine Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs.<note n="32" xml:id="d27fn32">Enrique Ruiz Guiñazú.</note>
                            The Japanese Minister is reported to have expressed to the President of
                            Chile the hope that Chile and Argentina would exert their combined
                            efforts for the maintenance of peace in South America.</p>

                        <p>764. For Under Secretary. Had more than an hour’s conversation, a very
                            frank one, with President Ríos and Barros Jarpa alone at the President’s
                            private house at 10 last night. Result will be sent as soon as
                            observations of Barros Jarpa on what I said are received.</p>
                        <p>Most important was the reply to the stated fact that Congress has not
                            ratified the agreements of Rio. The answer is that Foreign Affairs and
                            all matters of this sort is the exclusive prerogative of the President
                            and that this regime opposed the submission to Congress because its
                            submission would have been a recognition of the right of that body to
                            interfere with [its] prerogative. Barros Jarpa said that the agreement
                            is ratified by the President’s action in sending representatives to
                            conferences provided for by the agreements at Rio and Montevideo. <pb
                                n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0035"/>He said too that should the
                            President decide to break diplomatic relations it is not his duty or his
                            intention to consult Congress on the matter at all as this is
                            exclusively his prerogative. In other words the position is taken that
                            the agreements of Rio have been accepted by the Chilean Government in
                            accordance with the constitution here. This, I recall, was the position
                            of Aguirre Cerda 2 years ago on another matter. I am convinced that the
                            position now assumed is sound.</p>

                        <p>The Chilean Ambassador called to see me this morning at his request.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to mention to the Ambassador my regret that the Chilean
                            Government had never as yet given any public official expression of
                            thanks to the United States for the four batteries we had sent to Chile
                            at the time when Chile was in great need of them.<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d29fn33">The Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed
                                his Government’s appreciation in a note of June 15 to Ambassador
                                Bowers (825.348/3).</note> I said it seemed to me that a dignified
                            public statement of this character made by the Chilean Government would
                            cut the ground from under the feet of the German propagandists who were
                            assiduously spreading rumors to the effect that the United States had
                            undertaken military intervention in Chile against the Chilean
                            Government. I added that I was also informed that Axis propagandists in
                            Chile were now trying to create trouble between Peru and Chile, alleging
                            that the United States had sent a large number of American troops into
                            Peru and that this had been done in order to bring military pressure to
                            bear upon Chile through Peru. I said that, as the Ambassador knew, this
                            sort of propaganda was so fantastic as to create amazement in the minds
                            of intelligent people, and that I wondered if some opportunity could not
                            be taken by the Chilean Government to emphasize its close and friendly
                            ties with Peru in order that everyone in the two countries might realize
                            that stories of this character emanated solely from Axis
                            propagandists.</p>
                        <p>I said that in my judgment one of the foremost developments in
                            inter-American relations of the past decade had been the creation of a
                            very close and friendly relationship between Chile and Peru
                            notwithstanding their difficulties of earlier times, and that I felt
                            sure that any reaffirmation of these ties would be welcomed by public
                            opinion throughout the Hemisphere.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0036"/>
                        <p>I concluded by saying that, as the Ambassador well knew, the only forces
                            which the United States had in Peru were a couple of hundred men sent as
                            contractors to man the batteries which had been turned over to Peru at
                            the same time as the other four batteries to Chile. I made it clear that
                            of course we could not publicly discuss military arrangements of this
                            character under present conditions, but I did feel that if rumors of the
                            kind I had mentioned were allowed to continue unchecked, suspicions
                            might perhaps be sown in the minds of the less-educated part of the
                            peoples of the two neighboring countries which might result in harm
                            under present conditions.</p>

                            the sinking of the Chilean ship as the reason and they claim they would
                            like, for the purpose of bringing in that part of public opinion which
                            while pro-American doubts the wisdom of breaking relations, to have an
                            agreement in principle on the following: (1) they would like an increase
                            in copper price, a reasonable increase, and a reasonable guarantee from
                            Santiago for a minimum fixed tonnage and minimum fixed price for a
                            reasonable period after the war; (2) a reasonable increase in the price
                            of Metals Reserve purchases as in the case of tin in Bolivia, and a
                            reasonable assurance of the continuance of this Metals Reserve market
                            for a reasonable period after the war; (3) a reasonable increase in the
                            price of nitrate and iodine and guarantees regarding the market and
                            price for a reasonable period after the war emergency; (4) reasonable
                            guarantees to the effect that synthetic ammonia plants now being erected

                            approximate $100,000,000 to do the following things: <list>

                        <p>They say they realize this may seem like bargaining, but that they assume
                            some agreements will be made by us, and apparently they ask only an
                            agreement in principle before acting. This does not come from Barros
                            Jarpa nor, as I understand, is it known to him. The propositions have
                            been submitted to me indirectly, unofficially and personally for
                            transmission. While Barros Jarpa has been much more favorable to
                            breaking recently he is looked upon as the stumbling block by these
                            Ministers. This is all very confidential, of course.</p>
                        <p>3. Have been informed by same source that President Ríos is ready to go
                            along with these Ministers and break relations but he makes this
                            stipulation, “Under no circumstances would the active or reserve forces
                            of Chile be requested or required to do active service outside their own
                            territory or the national islands”.</p>
                        <p>I had sent the above by letter, but in view of the rapidity of movement
                            here now conclude it best to get it to the Department at once.</p>

                        <p>649. Your 885, June 2, 9 p.m. From the time of the attack of Japan
                            against the United States it has been our position that the logic of the
                            commitments of the American Republics regarding inter-American
                            solidarity and collaboration in the face of attack by non-American
                            powers required the severance of diplomatic relations between the
                            American Republics and the aggressor powers. This is not a subject for
                            bargaining. We believe it to be at least as much in the interest of
                            Chile as in the interest of the other countries that Chile sever
                            diplomatic relations. We believe and hope that as Chile begins fully to
                            comprehend the broad implications of its own situation in relation to
                            the solidarity of the Western Hemisphere it will sever diplomatic
                            relations.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0038"/>
                        <p>Obviously it is only fair to those countries which have severed
                            diplomatic relations and thereby taken a positive and affirmative step
                            for the security of the hemisphere to afford them all possible
                            assistance. We are prepared to render such assistance within the limits
                            of existing circumstances to Chile should it sever diplomatic relations.
                            We cannot discuss this assistance until after we know what Chile’s
                            policy is to be. We assume that we will definitively ascertain what
                            plans the Chilean Government has for a clearer definition of its
                            international policy from the Foreign Minister when he is in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I feel certain that you will appreciate that this is the only sound
                            procedure to follow at this juncture.</p>

                        <p>953. For Secretary and Under Secretary. At 4 this afternoon saw the
                            President at his request and Barros Jarpa was present. The substance of
                            your telegram 649, June 6, 2 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m., was given
                            to Graham who acted as emissary between Finance Minister and me, and
                            Graham told that Minister that a reply had been received by me which
                            clearly outlined our position but that in view of possible
                            misinterpretations he thought it should be received from me and in the
                            regular diplomatic manner. Clearly the Finance Minister so informed the
                            President. Hence my summons. He began by saying he was making the
                            proposition of the Finance Minister official. I gave him the substance
                            of the reply. He seemed shocked and distressed that his Government
                            should have been put in the position of bargaining since he had
                            determined on a policy in keeping with common dignity, and he asked me
                            to disabuse your minds of the idea that he had any such thought. He said
                            the Finance Minister has his special problems and in seeking a solution
                            inadvertently perhaps tied up two things in such a way as to create a
                            bad impression. Whether he resented the fact that the Finance Minister
                            had unwittingly injected himself into a field not his, or Barros Jarpa
                            gave such a twist to his comments I am not quite certain.</p>
                        <p>The President, backed by Barros Jarpa, said that his Government is
                            following a very clearly defined path against the Nazis and their
                            activities; that he had informed the Congressional Committee
                            investigating the Nazis that all the facilities and facts in possession
                            of Government are at its disposal; that he himself had just reprimanded
                            a judge who in a case involving our enemies had seemed too lenient; and
                            he gave the impression that he knows that the present activities of the
                            Government lead directly and logically to the breaking of relations.</p>
                        <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0039"/>
                        <p>I emphasized in Barros Jarpa’s presence the importance we attach to the
                            latter’s early visit to Washington; that President Roosevelt, Hull and
                            Welles expect excellent results; and that he absolutely must go as soon
                            as possible. Barros Jarpa replied that he had just wired the Chilean
                            Ambassador in Uruguay for exact information as to time of Minister’s
                            arrival here; and he certainly left no doubt that he is going.</p>
                        <p>I think the conversation was most helpful since without my initiative I
                            was given the opportunity of impressing on the President the wish of the
                            United States that Chile should break relations; and the importance we
                            attach to the forthcoming visit of Barros Jarpa. On leaving the
                            President reiterated an earnest request that I disabuse your mind of the
                            feeling that he sanction[ed] any bargaining or knew that any proposition
                            like bargaining was being submitted to us. It is quite possible that the
                            Finance Minister told him of the propositions of an economic nature he
                            had made without indicating that the breaking of relations was to be the
                            consideration. Both President and Minister were very cordial.</p>

                        <p>989. For the Under Secretary. Last night at a dinner Barros Jarpa amazed
                            me by asking if I thought a recognition of Russia, which he said had
                            already been accorded when Chile’s representative in the League voted
                            the admission of Russia, would be additional proof of <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0040"/>Chile’s adherence to cause of the
                            democracies. I countered by asking his opinion as to the effect in
                            Chile. His reply that he does not care about that is in striking
                            contrast to his insistence on the sacredness of public opinion on
                            breaking relations. This is additional proof of his determination to
                            prevent a breaking of relations if possible and is inexplicable to me.
                            He said if we forced a break in relations there will be a bitter
                            reaction against the United States, and I finished the sentence with,
                            “from the Chilean Nazis who love us now”. He admitted that contents of
                            your telegram 649, June 6, 2 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m. covered in
                            my telegram 953, June 11, 5 p.m. gives him the impression we are
                            pressing hard and the Brazilian Ambassador told me Barros Jarpa had
                            spoken to him about it. The Minister commented on the inability to get
                            certain planes or more Import-Export Bank credits as evidence that we
                            are getting hard on Chile.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Minister of Finance, Matte, says he and his group
                            will win the fight for breaking relations and Barros Jarpa admits
                            majority of Ministers favor it. Also I was told last night by Luis
                                Subercaseaux<note n="41" xml:id="d34fn41">Chilean Ambassador to
                                Peru.</note> that Gustavo Ross,<note n="42" xml:id="d34fn42">Onetime
                                Minister of the Treasury and Presidential candidate.</note> now
                            here, is militantly proally. Am about persuaded that explanation of
                            Barros Jarpa’s attitude is that he and possibly Ríos planned to create a
                            rightist government thus repudiating the parties that elected Ríos and
                            the conservatives and liberals as a whole are against breaking
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>There is some hope of Barros Jarpa yet in view of his undoubted hostility
                            to Nazis and Japs and should the enemy be caught in some specific act
                            there is a chance he would seize upon it as a pretext and thus break
                            without compromising his prestige.</p>

                        <p>The Chilean Ambassador called this morning to see the Secretary of State
                            at the latter’s request.</p>
                        <p>After preliminary courtesies, Secretary Hull asked the Ambassador what
                            impressions he brought back with him from his recent visit to Santiago.
                            The Ambassador replied that his impressions were entirely favorable and
                            that he could assure this Government that more than 75 percent of the
                            people of Chile were completely in sympathy with the United States and
                            with the cause of the United Nations. He said that of course in Chile
                            they had Nazi sympathizers, but he added that that situation existed in
                            many other countries, including the United States. He said that the
                            chief difficulty was the fact that people were generally afraid of a
                            Nazi attack upon Chile in the event that Chile broke relations with the
                            Axis powers or took some overt step against the Axis powers. Secretary
                            Hull said that he fully recognized the friendly disposition of the
                            Chilean Government and the Chilean people and that he had long been
                            aware of the fine quality of so many leaders of public opinion in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the President of Chile had charged him to say
                            to this Government that Chile had absolutely no understanding of any
                            character with the Argentine Government and that Chile was completely
                            free to determine for herself, without the knowledge of Argentina, the
                            foreign policy which she would pursue. He stated further that the
                            President of Chile desired him to state that the Government of Chile
                            would cooperate fully with the United States and would take such action
                            as in the judgment of the United States was required in the vital
                            interests of the United States and in the interest of hemispheric
                            defense. The Ambassador added that of <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"
                                facs="0042"/>course there were various problems which Chile had to
                            solve and which the President of Chile desired this Government to bear
                            in mind in the event that Chile changed her present foreign policy and
                            severed relations with the Axis powers.</p>

                        <p>The Chilean Ambassador called to see me this morning at his request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador came to my office after the conclusion of his interview
                            with Secretary Hull and gave me the following information.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he had seen the President of Chile at the
                            insistent request of the latter the moment he arrived in Santiago. The
                            President, he said, could not have been more affectionate or more
                            demonstrative, and stated to the Ambassador that the latter possessed
                            his full confidence and support. He said that at this conference a good
                            many senators and deputies were present and he consequently did not have
                            the opportunity of discussing confidentially various questions with the
                            President. He stated that on the following day he saw the President
                            again. The Ambassador said that he found that the President was very
                            greatly misinformed, not only with regard to public opinion and the
                            views of the Government of the United States, but also with regard to
                            the world situation in general. He said that this applied equally to the
                            members of the Cabinet. The Ambassador said that in this conversation
                            and in subsequent conversations with the President he had explained in
                            detail and very frankly to President Ríos the precise position and views
                            of the Government of the United States. He said that he had told the
                            President that no one who knew what the United States was doing and no
                            one who was following the world situation from Washington could have the
                            slightest doubt as to the ultimate outcome. The victory of the United
                            States, he said, was inevitable. He had told the President that it might
                            be three years or five years longer before the end of the war came
                            about, but that there was no question as to who would attain the
                            ultimate victory. For that reason, he said, he had told the President
                            that a continued delay on the part of Chile in severing relations with
                            the Axis powers and thus removing a source of grave danger to the United
                            States and the other American Republics would inevitably increase
                            antagonism in the United States against Chile, with very serious
                            detriment to the latter country.</p>
                        <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0043"/>
                        <p>In the final conversation which he had had with the President, the
                            President told the Ambassador specifically to state to the United States
                            Government that Chile would be prepared to break diplomatic relations
                            with the Axis powers should the United States Government deem this
                            desirable. President Ríos did not wish to give for a moment the
                            semblance of negotiating a deal with the United States, but he wished to
                            make it clear nevertheless that unless Chile could obtain military and
                            naval matériel which would make it possible for Chile to undertake at
                            least a minimum of self-defense, public opinion in Chile, on account of
                            the panic which had been created by Axis propaganda, would not support
                            his Government in a breaking of relations with the Axis countries.
                            President Ríos also wanted to receive some assurances that in the event
                            that, through Japanese or German attacks, the Chilean mining industry
                            was put out of commission and 100,000 Chilean miners thrown out of work,
                            the Government of the United States would do what was necessary to see
                            Chile through the economic crisis which such unemployment would
                            create.</p>
                        <p>These two points appeared to be the only points upon which the President
                            of Chile desired assurances. I told the Ambassador that it seemed to me
                            that, in view of the very friendly and frank statements made to this
                            Government, through him, by the President of Chile, the first immediate
                            need would be to ascertain from the communications already made to us by
                            the Chilean Government what the minimum defense requirements of Chile
                            might be; that if it then appeared that these requirements were within
                            limits which this country could meet, a tentative agreement be worked
                            out between the Ambassador and myself stipulating the amounts and times
                            of deliveries of military and naval equipment to be furnished Chile
                            under a Lend-Lease agreement which would then be signed. I said that
                            once such an agreement had tentatively been agreed upon, we would then
                            be in a position to assure Chile that if Chile severed relations with
                            the Axis powers this Government would then be prepared to sign a
                            Lend-Lease agreement with Chile and deliver matériel to Chile under the
                            schedules carried in such agreement. The Ambassador stated that this
                            would be most satisfactory to his Government.</p>

                        <p>883. Refer to letter of July 30, 1942 to the Ambassador from the Under
                                Secretary.<note n="46" xml:id="d38fn46">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President had a long conversation with Ambassador Michels on August
                            5. In this conversation the Ambassador communicated <pb n="30"
                                xml:id="pg_30" facs="0044"/>very much, the same message from
                            President Ríos as that which the Ambassador had previously communicated
                            to the Department.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Ambassador’s remarks the President said that he was
                            going to speak very frankly on account of his great friendship for Chile
                            and the Chilean people. At the present moment Chile was placed in a
                            false light throughout the Americas and was regarded generally as
                            following the same line and policy as that pursued by Argentina. The
                            President knew, of course, that this was not the case but the fact was
                            that public opinion throughout the Americas thought that this was so.
                            The President did not believe with a view to the future the Chilean
                            people would wish to have this misapprehension continued.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he was not thinking only of the United
                            States but he was thinking also of the safety of all of the countries of
                            the Americas. Under present conditions there was no way in which the
                            Chilean Government, so long as Axis diplomatic and consular
                            establishments continued to function in Chile, could prevent the sending
                            of information by those establishments covering such vitally important
                            matters as the movement of ships and other intelligence directly related
                            to the war effort of the American nations. The President knew that such
                            information was reaching Japan and Germany directly from Chile. It might
                            be, the President added, that in certain cases this information was
                            received through Spain but he felt that a grave danger to the Western
                            Hemisphere arose from the information sent by the Axis diplomats
                            themselves. The President then stated bluntly that he did not desire
                            that Chile should enter the war but he did urgently desire that Chile
                            break diplomatic relations with the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed the defense problem of Chile. He did not
                            foresee any danger to Chile other than that which might result from an
                            isolated bombardment of the Chilean coast undertaken by some Japanese
                            submarine which would make the effort for propaganda purposes. Such an
                            attack would create little danger. In any event, the batteries furnished
                            Chile by the United States made it possible for Chile to defend her most
                            exposed ports from any such attack as this. The President then explained
                            what the United States was doing in patrolling the Atlantic coast in
                            order to ascertain the whereabouts of German submarines. The bulk of
                            this patrol work was being undertaken by small planes which did not
                            generally have a flying range of more than two or three hundred miles.
                            The results obtained from this patrol service had been outstandingly
                            successful. The President assured the Ambassador that were Chile to
                            break diplomatic relations, the United States, under the schedules now
                            being prepared for a lend-lease agreement, can furnish at least fifty to
                            one <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0045"/>hundred planes of the same
                            character as those being used for patrolling the Atlantic seaboard of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>This report with regard to the President’s conversation is being
                            furnished you for your strictly personal information. You will kindly

                            in Chile by Axis nationals or by elements instigated and dominated by
                            Axis agents after Chile has broken relations with the Axis, President
                            Ríos may of course count on the support of the United States to the
                            extent that the Chilean Government may request such support and to the
                            full extent of the ability of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that the President and the people of Chile are fully aware of
                            the tremendous forces of aggression that have been loosed in the world
                            and yet are convinced that there is no doubt concerning the ultimate
                            victory of the United Nations.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Duggan</hi>: The Chilean Ambassador telephoned
                            me on the afternoon of August 13 to say that he was having some
                            difficulty reconciling the number of planes included in the list handed
                            him by Mr. Welles, with the statements made to him by the President and
                            by Mr. Welles. After discussing the matter with you and examining the
                            list, I informed the Ambassador that the situation was as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Forty planes on the War Department list as in process of

                                    future delivery.</p>

                                <p>Two planes on the Navy Department list for delivery before the
                                    end of 1942.</p>
                                <p>Eighteen planes on the Navy Department list for delivery prior to
                                    June 30, 1943. That should make a total of ninety-seven.</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>I stated that in addition to these ninety-seven planes the President and
                            Mr. Welles had mentioned fifty planes for patrolling activities. I said
                            that these planes were not included in the list handed to the Ambassador
                            and that we had not yet been informed exactly as to the type and
                            specifications thereof.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon Señor Rodríguez of the Chilean Embassy, in the
                            Ambassador’s absence, asked me whether we had yet received any further
                            information regarding these fifty planes. I replied in the negative.</p>
                        <p>If you will let me know whether these planes are to be supplied by the
                            War or Navy Departments, I will be glad to take the question up directly
                            with those Departments for the purpose of clarifying this matter.</p>

                        <p>The Chilean Ambassador called to see me this afternoon at my request.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that to my great regret I was becoming uneasy with
                            regard to certain indications which I had recently received regarding
                            the basic question of Chile’s foreign policy. I said that when the
                            Ambassador had recently returned from his exceedingly helpful and useful
                            visit to Santiago the Ambassador by direction of the President of Chile
                            had stated to the President and the Secretary of State and to myself
                            that President Ríos desired the Government of the United States to know
                            that if President Roosevelt felt it necessary for the security of the
                            United States and for the defense of the Western Hemisphere, Chile was
                            prepared to go to “any lengths including a rupture of diplomatic
                            relations with the Axis powers”. In reply to this statement the
                            President had said to the Ambassador that the Government of the United
                            States did in fact believe that a rupture of relations with the Axis
                            powers by Chile was imperatively required for the security of the United
                            States and for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. This message had
                            been transmitted by the Ambassador to the President of Chile. The
                            President had invited President Ríos to <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33"
                                facs="0047"/>visit Washington and President Ríos had officially
                            accepted the invitation.</p>
                        <p>Since that time I had received information which led me to believe that
                            the Government of Chile had no present intention of breaking relations
                            with the Axis powers and no indication whatever had been given that this
                            rupture of relations would be undertaken before the visit of President
                            Ríos to Washington.</p>
                        <p>Speaking, I said, primarily in the interest of close and friendly
                            relations between Chile and the United States, but also with due regard
                            for the position of Chile and for the dignity of the Chilean Government,
                            I could not refrain from emphasizing to the Ambassador my belief that
                            the rupture of relations with the Axis powers as definitely promised by
                            the President of Chile should take place prior to the visit to
                            Washington of President Ríos. I said I was sure the Ambassador would
                            agree that if the President of Chile visited Washington and subsequently
                            broke relations with the Axis powers, the argument would be advanced by
                            Axis propagandists and by opponents of the Chilean Government that this
                            step had been taken as a result of pressure brought to bear upon him by
                            the United States Government or even the argument might be advanced that
                            undue and illicit influence of one kind or another had had its part in
                            such decision. More than that, I said, this would be the first occasion
                            in the history of our two countries when a President of Chile had
                            visited the United States. I felt it in the highest degree important
                            that the reception accorded President Ríos by the people of the United
                            States should be in the highest degree enthusiastic and sincere and that
                            I knew the Ambassador would understand that if the President of Chile
                            visited the United States while Chile still maintained relations with
                            the Axis powers, public opinion in the United States would not be nearly
                            so enthusiastic nor favorable as if Chile had taken this step prior to
                            the President’s visit.</p>
                        <p>I said I could not help but feel that these questions were of such
                            fundamental importance that the Ambassador himself would wish to
                            emphasize them to President Ríos. I said I felt that the Ambassador’s
                            personal communications to the President of Chile would be peculiarly
                            valuable at this time in order to counteract what I feared was bad
                            advice tendered him by certain persons who were determined to move in
                            every possible way to prevent a rupture of relations between Chile and
                            the Axis nations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he agreed with every word I had said to him and
                            that as a matter of fact he had written only a few days ago directly to
                            President Ríos pointing out the very same arguments that I myself had
                            advanced. The Ambassador said that President Ríos had definitely and
                            officially committed himself to the President of the United States to
                            break relations with the Axis powers. The <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34"
                                facs="0048"/>Ambassador had been the intermediary in making this
                            communication to President Roosevelt. If this commitment were not
                            carried out, the Ambassador would immediately resign his post since he
                            would never agree to represent a chief of state who failed to carry out
                            his official commitments. …</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in view of our conversation he would again write
                            immediately a personal letter which would reach the President of Chile
                            directly. He emphasized his own belief that nothing could be more fatal
                            nor more disadvantageous for Chile than the failure on the part of
                            President Ríos to break relations before he undertook his visits to
                            Washington and to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                        <p>1067. Your 1494, September 15, 5 p.m. Ambassador Michels must have
                            misunderstood me if he thought I acquiesced in the view he expressed
                            under instructions of his Government that it was preferable that Chile
                            defer until after the President’s visit to the United States rupture of
                            diplomatic relations with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>I replied to the Ambassador’s observation that President Ríos and himself
                            were of course within their proper scope in supporting whatever point of
                            view on this matter that seemed to them preferable. By the same token,
                            the Ambassador and his Government would appreciate that we were entitled
                            to adhere to our own point of view. From the outset, it had been the
                            judgment of the President, Mr. Welles <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"
                                facs="0049"/>and myself that the break of relations with the Axis
                            should come before the visit rather than afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Michels took no exception to what I said although he continued
                            to press the point of view of his Government. I am sorry if I failed to
                            make clear to the Ambassador our position and will go over it with him
                            again tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>To recapitulate our attitude, President Ríos conveyed the message to the
                            President through Ambassador Michels that Chile was ready to cooperate
                            in the defense of the hemisphere in whatever way indicated by President
                            Roosevelt. The President was most grateful for this constructive
                            attitude and requested the Ambassador to inform President Ríos that he
                            would appreciate Chile’s rupturing relations with the Axis. The
                            President also asked the Ambassador to inform President Ríos that he
                            hoped President Ríos could visit him in Washington. It was the
                            President’s belief, which has been maintained by all of us, that Chile
                            would rupture relations in response to his indication and that President
                            Ríos would then visit the United States.</p>

                            made special mention of the fifty planes which the President had offered
                            in addition to the equipment on the lists furnished him by the

                        <p>The Ambassador of Chile called to see me this afternoon at his request.
                            The Ambassador told me that he had just learned that General Espinosa,
                            Chilean representative on the Interamerican Defense Commission, had
                            received direct word from General Escudero, Chief of Staff of the
                            Chilean Army that the Government of Chile intended to break relations in
                            the near future and that General Espinosa was, consequently, to shape
                            his conduct in the United States with that in mind.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador had also received word that his Government had issued
                            directives to the Chilean newspapers to prepare the way editorially for
                            a rupture of relations with the Axis.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he wished to state very frankly that he now felt
                            that the action taken by this Government in bringing home publicly and
                            clearly to public opinion in his own country and to the members of the
                            Chilean Senate and House of Representatives the true facts in the
                            picture had been altogether desirable and that the results in all
                            probability would soon prove it. I told the Ambassador that the
                            statement he had just made was, of course, deeply gratifying to me
                            personally.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador further discussed at some length recent developments in
                            Chilean politics …</p>

                            the least possible delay and not be withheld until rupture actually
                            takes place, arguing that it would relieve military fears, enhance good
                            feeling in the army, and be accepted as a gratifying expression of
                            confidence in Chile’s pledge to break with the Axis. I urgently support

                        <p>1434. Your 2027, November 21, 3 p.m. The Department does not feel that it
                            can accede to the request of the Chilean authorities that certain of the
                            armament set forth in a list handed to the Chilean Ambassador by the
                            Under Secretary last August be made available to Chile prior to Chile’s
                            rupture of relations with the Axis. The reasons for this position are as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>In the matter of arms and munitions, Chile was for some months
                                    after the outbreak of the war treated on a par with those
                                    American republics which either declared war on the Axis or
                                    break [<hi rend="italic">broke</hi>] relations and which, in
                                    general, lived up to their inter-American commitments. So far as
                                    actual amounts of arms and munitions sent, Chile’s position
                                    compares very favorably with that of many other of these
                                    republics. This attitude on the part of the Government of the

                            prepared to do everything which might be considered necessary for the
                            security of the continent. The President expressed his appreciation and
                            said that the most effective step Chile could take for the security of
                            the hemisphere was rupture of diplomatic relations by Chile with the
                            Axis. The President then extended the invitation to President Ríos.
                            Shortly thereafter, a list of war materials which could be made
                            available to Chile following a break in relations was furnished to
                            Ambassador Michels and by him to General Espinosa and to the appropriate
                            authorities in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter and until the date of my speech at Boston, Chile did nothing
                            whatever to indicate that Ambassador Michels’ statement to President
                            Roosevelt had been anything more than empty verbiage. President Ríos did
                            plan to come to the United States, leaving Santiago some 10 weeks after
                            the invitation was extended. The invitation itself was used throughout
                            this period and continues to be used as a motive <pb n="40"
                                xml:id="pg_40" facs="0054"/>for delaying the break in relations. In
                            other words, what President Roosevelt thought would facilitate the
                            attainment of what he had been given to understand was a common desire
                            of the two governments, namely, the elimination of highly prejudicial
                            Axis diplomatic and subversive activity in this continent, was used by
                            the Chilean authorities and is still being used by them to delay the
                            attainment of this objective.</p>
                        <p>The invitation to Ríos still stands. If and when he comes, regardless of
                            the action which Chile may have taken to live up to her commitments, he
                            will, of course, receive a courteous welcome in official circles.
                            However, in view of the very natural war-time psychology prevalent in
                            the United States, which psychology is, as you will recognize, one of
                            our major assets in the conduct of the war, it has been thought
                            desirable to ask you to indicate clearly to President Ríos our
                            misgivings as to the type of popular and press reception which he would
                            receive if he were to take advantage of President Roosevelt’s invitation
                            before carrying out the official and authoritative commitment as a
                            result of which that invitation was extended. (I refer in this
                            connection to my personal letter to you of November 19).<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d51fn56">Not found in Department files.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It also seems desirable that you bear in mind the effect upon the Chilean
                            position of the passage of time. The United States has now been in the
                            war nearly a year. Ten months have elapsed since Rio. Nearly four months
                            have passed since President Ríos told President Roosevelt that he would
                            do anything necessary for continental security. According to the
                            “authoritative and official commitment” which Fernández and Ríos have
                            given you, there will be no rupture of relations until the return of
                            Ríos from his trip. In other words, the German, Japanese and Italian
                            diplomatic and consular agents in Chile are guaranteed at the very least
                            another three months of immunity.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs with you that matters may be allowed to rest as
                            they are and that you should limit yourself to such repetition of the
                            Department’s views as previously expressed as may in your judgment be
                            useful. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>Today at noon the President received the Chilean Ambassador, Señor
                            Morales and myself. Señor Morales asked me to give the President the
                            attached statement which he had prepared in writing<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d52fn57">Not printed.</note> in view of his inability to
                            express himself fluently in English. The President read the message and
                            said that he fully realized the difficulty of preparing any democracy
                            “spiritually”, referring to the statement of the Chilean Minister of the
                            Interior contained in the written declaration that it had been necessary
                            “materially and spiritually” to arm Chile in order to convert her into
                            an ally and not into a defense problem.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that he was the bearer of a personal message to
                            the President from the President of Chile that Chile had decided
                            immediately to break diplomatic relations with the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he was very glad indeed to receive this
                            information and then explained to the Minister at some length the
                            difficulties and dangers the United States had encountered in the World
                            War of 1914–1918 on account of espionage and clandestine radio
                            activities which were then taking place under Axis auspices in Mexico.
                            The President explained how these had been checked. The President then
                            continued by saying that very much the same sort of dangers had been
                            occasioned the United States by the Axis subversive activities which had
                            taken place in Chile until very recently and that, while he was very
                            sorry to have to mention this fact, it nevertheless was a fact. The
                            President then said that he felt sure that the step which the Government
                            of Chile now contemplated would prove to be in the interest of Chile
                            herself, that the situation of the United Nations had improved very
                            materially in the last few months, and that for Chile to join the
                            democracies in the manner proposed would inevitably be a happy solution
                            to the problem which Chile had encountered. He went on to explain why it
                            was essential for the United Nations to concentrate upon defeating
                            Germany first, since if Germany was defeated, Japan was inevitably
                            defeated likewise, whereas if the United States concentrated on
                            defeating Japan first, the defeat of Germany would be long
                            postponed.</p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0056"/>
                        <p>Señor Morales then raised the question of the dangers to which Chile
                            would be exposed when she broke relations. The President said that Japan
                            was not in a position to do any real damage to Chile, that the most that
                            Japan could do would be to send a submarine, fire a few shells on the
                            Chilean coast, as Japan had done against the California coast some six
                            months ago, and that the effect had simply been to stimulate the morale
                            of the people of California and the same result would occur if Japan
                            attempted the same action against Chile. Señor Morales raised the
                            question of the defenseless character of such strategic points on the
                            Chilean coast as electric power stations, upon which the supply of
                            copper depended. The President suggested that he discuss these details
                            with me at a meeting which we were due to have this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The conversation concluded by the Minister saying to the President that
                            his mission here was to inform the United States Government that the
                            policy of Chile had never been un-inter-American and had always been
                            designed to cooperate in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. He also
                            requested that the message he had communicated to the President be
                            regarded as confidential, since only the President of Chile himself
                            should announce the intention of the Chilean Government to break
                            relations with the Axis powers.</p>
                        <p>The Minister likewise left with the President a long memorandum<note
                                n="58" xml:id="d52fn58">Not printed.</note> written in Spanish which
                            I said I would have translated and give to the President, and I also
                            told the President that the Minister had a personal letter addressed to
                            the President by the President of Chile which the Minister would give me
                            later and which I would give to the President.<note n="59"

                        <p>1521. From the Under Secretary. Morales has communicated to the President
                            the decision of the Chilean Government immediately to break relations
                            with the Axis. My own conversations with Morales have been concerned
                            with the following points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Although I have tactfully pointed out to Morales that Chile’s
                                    inter-American commitments have for nearly a year furnished
                                    ample justification for a break in relations, he is insistent
                                    upon the development of some specific pretext which can be made
                                    the occasion of the break and which will ensure a maximum of
                                    support for the Government’s action among the Chilean people.

                                    the death of United Nations citizens. The Minister stated that
                                    the Chilean Government would use this information as the
                                    justification for the immediate break of relations with the
                                    Axis.</item>

                                <item>Although both the President and I pointed out to Morales that
                                    the situation of Chile in relation to possible attack from the
                                    Axis and particularly from Japan was considerably more favorable
                                    than that of the United States and of other American Republics
                                    which had complied with their inter-American commitments, he was
                                    emphatic as to the need for providing for the protection of
                                    specific points on the Chilean coast, including especially
                                    Tocopilla and Coronel (the coal area), and possibly Valparaiso.
                                    The President has agreed to consider the furnishing of such
                                    material and the matter is being discussed with our military and
                                    naval authorities. I took occasion to point out in this
                                    connection that our Government does not feel that the effective
                                    cooperation which it has already rendered Chile in defense
                                    matters has been recognized or appreciated by the Government of
                                    Chile. Morales, together with the Chilean Ambassador here, and
                                    the military and naval personnel of the Embassy are proceeding
                                    to examine the list of war matériel which was furnished the
                                    Chilean Government last August in order to ascertain whether any
                                    added matériel is now required. The Chilean Ambassador has
                                    already expressed the view that the aforesaid list was extremely
                                    comprehensive and satisfactory. It will be recalled that, at the
                                    time, the Ambassador told me on behalf of his Government that
                                    the Chilean military authorities were very pleased.</item>

                        <p>My interview last night with Morales concluded with the statement by
                            Morales that he felt, in view of the satisfactory agreement which we had
                            reached on the above two points, he could plan to return immediately to
                            Santiago. [Welles.]</p>

                            President Ríos would make an early visit to the United States has caused
                            general discussion here and the opponents of rupture who by no means
                            have given up the fight are using it to maintain that there is no
                            insistent desire on our part that Chile break relations.</p>

                        <p>1529. Your 2199, December 18, 1 p.m. The President stated to Morales and
                            will probably include a statement to the same effect in a letter to
                            President Ríos that he hopes that as soon as the difficulties of the
                            immediate future in Chile have been surmounted, President Ríos may reach
                            the conclusion that he would be justified in coming to the United States
                            in accordance with the invitation which President Roosevelt had the
                            pleasure of extending to him 4 months ago.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Chile and the Minister of the Interior of Chile called
                            this morning at my request.</p>
                        <p>I told Señor Morales that, as a result of our last very agreeable and
                            satisfactory conversation, I felt there were only two further points to
                            be discussed between us.</p>
                        <p>The first of these points, I said, had to do with the request of Señor
                            Morales that I make available to him, secretly and for the secret
                            information of the President of Chile, a specific statement showing how
                            American ships that had left Chile had been sunk in the Caribbean as a
                            result of clandestine radio messages sent by German agents in Valparaiso
                            to German military or naval agents. I said that the Navy Department had
                            prepared two documents for me, one of these a memorandum showing in
                            considerable detail how five American ships had been sunk as a result of
                            these subversive activities in Chile and the place and manner of their
                            sinking. The other document, which was solely for the information of the
                            President of Chile and the Minister of the Interior, contained the
                            deciphered texts of two of these clandestine messages. I handed the
                            Minister the two messages in question, copies of which are
                                attached.<note n="61" xml:id="d56fn61">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he would keep these messages in the secrecy
                            requested and that the information given him was exactly what he
                            required.</p>
                        <p>The second point, I said, had to do with the request made by the Minister
                            that certain defense matériel be made available immediately to the
                            Government of Chile for use when the breaking of relations <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0059"/>by Chile took place. I said that on this
                            subject I wished to speak very frankly with the Minister. I said that
                            last August I had given to the Chilean Ambassador in Washington a
                            confidential memorandum<note n="62" xml:id="d56fn62">Memorandum not
                                found in Department files.</note> showing the categories of military
                            and naval matériel which the United States Government would be able and
                            prepared to make available to Chile in the event that Chile broke
                            relations with the Axis powers. In addition to that memorandum, I said,
                            the United States had been furnishing Chile naval and military matériel
                            since early last winter just as if Chile had actually signed a
                            lend-lease agreement with the United States, and that in this manner the
                            United States had made it plain to Chile that it desired to furnish
                            Chile with every possible means of defense, in view of the defenseless
                            condition of Chile, notwithstanding the fact that Chile had taken no
                            definite action with regard to her relations with the Axis powers. The
                            subsidiary list<note n="63" xml:id="d56fn63">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> which the Minister had now sent to me through the
                            Chilean Embassy contained many items which were not on the list which I
                            had handed the Chilean Ambassador last August and raised a question
                            which it would seem to me neither Chile nor the United States would
                            desire to confront, namely, a question which appeared to give rise to
                            the interpretation—quite unfounded, of course—that Chile was now
                            prepared to break relations with the Axis powers because of the new
                            bargain struck between the United States and Chile, a bargain furnishing
                            Chile additional quantities of defense matériel not already contemplated
                            by the Government of the United States. I said I felt that it was better
                            for both countries not to take any action which would give rise to an
                            unfounded interpretation of this character.</p>
                        <p>I stated that when Chile broke relations with the Axis powers, the
                            lend-lease agreement already negotiated could be signed immediately and
                            that I could only reassure the Minister once more, as I had frequently
                            stated to the Chilean Ambassador, that this Government would be prepared
                            to do everything possible to cooperate with Chile by the furnishing of
                            matériel under the lend-lease agreement for the defense of the territory
                            of Chile. I concluded by stating that I felt under these conditions it
                            was far better to leave the exact determination of what matériel should
                            be sent and when it should be sent to the military and naval experts of
                            our two countries. Both General Espinosa and Admiral Moreno, the Chilean
                            military and naval representatives in Washington, had the complete
                            confidence and regard of our own military and naval authorities and I
                            said I felt quite sure that both Governments could safely rely upon
                            their military and naval experts to find a satisfactory and efficient
                            solution of the defense problem.</p>
                        <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0060"/>
                        <p>At this point the Ambassador interrupted to say that the Minister should
                            always bear in mind the fact that the United States Government had been
                            making continually available to Chile during the past eleven months
                            large quantities of defense matériel, both military and naval, and that
                            the two Governments should have sufficient confidence one in the other
                            to rest assured that the United States and Chile would cooperate
                            completely with regard to the Chilean defense problem.</p>
                        <p>Señor Morales said that he was entirely satisfied to leave the matter in
                            this way and that he would at once inform the President of Chile by
                            cable of the statements I had made to him. He said that he had now
                            planned to arrive in Santiago on January 2 and that as soon as he
                            returned, he would send me a personal message through the Chilean
                            Ambassador in Washington to let me know the exact date upon which Chile
                            would break relations. The Ambassador suggested that January 15 would be
                            an appropriate date inasmuch as that date marked the anniversary of the
                            Rio de Janeiro conference. Señor Morales agreed to this suggestion and
                            said he thought it might be possible that the date for breaking
                            relations be even earlier than that. I concluded by stating that I
                            desired to emphasize my own great respect and admiration for the Chilean
                            Government and people and that I felt the one important thing now to
                            avoid was the permitting of so long a time to elapse before relations
                            were broken as to allow conjecture as to Chile’s attitude to be current
                            once more in the press of all of the other American Republics. I said
                            that I thought if the action contemplated were taken promptly, and by
                            that I meant within the next two or three weeks, the reaction throughout
                            the Hemisphere would be most enthusiastic and satisfactory and that in
                            that event the history of the past months would soon be forgotten and
                            Chile would be welcomed by all of the other American Republics into the
                            fold of the American nations who were cooperating for the security of
                            the Western Hemisphere and for the preservation of the ideals which we
                            all shared.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that immediately upon his return to Santiago he would
                            emphasize in his statements to the Cabinet and to the Chilean Senate
                            that he had found in Washington nothing but friendship for Chile and a
                            very great measure of understanding for the desire of the Chilean
                            Government now to align itself with the other American nations who had
                            come out against the Axis powers. He said he would emphasize that the
                            Government of the United States had at no time, in any way or manner,
                            brought the slightest pressure to bear upon Chile and that the only
                            interpretation he could give to American policy with regard to Chile was
                            that it was for Chile to decide whether she would break relations or
                            not, but that if she did break relations the United States would do
                            everything possible to cooperate with her.</p>

                            up in the official record. Bill was returned to Chamber of Deputies and
                            expected to pass without alteration. Copper companies now object to
                            provision in the law which stated that the President of Chile by decree
                            can insist that 20% of the exports of raw materials be returned to Chile
                            in the form of finished products. Copper companies say impossible to
                            comply with such a [provision?]. Minister of Finance stated frankly to a
                            company representative that he considered this provision a club to

                        <p>61. The Federal Loan Agency informs us that the negotiations for the
                            agreement with the Chilean Government having to do with strategic and
                            critical materials are now completed and that it is desired to have the
                            document signed on Monday, the 19th. Our understanding <pb n="48"
                                xml:id="pg_48" facs="0062"/>is that the form, contemplated is an

                            and that your reply will be countersigned by Graham as the
                            representative of the Federal Loan Agency. This form seems satisfactory
                            to the Department. Before, however, authorizing you finally to sign,
                            would you kindly telegraph at once the text of your contemplated reply

                            Company, which we understand is controlled by Mauricio Hochschild, now
                            has orders pending for shipment from Chile during the month of March for
                            a total of 212 tons for the Argentine Ministry of War and 150 tons for
                            the Ministry of Marine. It is understood that all Chilean copper sales
                            to this market are now handled through Anaconda directly by Copper
                            Export Association, Inc., 25 Broadway, New York, and that Mr. William E.
                            Kennedy, Vice President, is in charge of the business. The Embassy at
                            Santiago has been requested to look into the matter and see if these and
                            any other shipments now pending can be delayed until approved by the
                            Board of Economic Warfare. This Embassy is convinced that some control
                            such as this is necessary, if the United States Proclaimed List is to be
                            in any way made effective in the Argentine. All evidence available
                            indicates that the Argentine Ministry of War and probably the Ministry
                            of Marine will deliver a goodly part of the raw copper they receive to
                            the local firm Sociedad Electro Metalúrgico Argentina (Sema), which is
                            now on the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>As the local office of the South American Mining Company have repeatedly
                            asserted their desire to cooperate in every way, and as the only other
                            copper producers in Chile are American companies, it should be a
                            relatively easy matter to obtain a full control of the Chilean copper
                            exports and thus ascertain the degree to which Argentina must depend
                            upon the United States for its copper import requirements.</p>
                        <p>The matter is one of immediate concern and full advice as to any action
                            that the Department may take would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                        <p>681. The American copper companies are worried over the ever increasing
                            demand for raw copper from Chilean concerns able to purchase it at
                            artificially low peso price and export it to Argentina at a premium
                            price. The chief offender is the Chilean army workshops which applies a
                            little fabrication (thick sheets) and extorts a large middleman’s profit
                            from export to Argentina which possibly through established channels is
                            already receiving its minimum requirements.</p>
                        <p>The copper companies are required by law to supply Chilean needs and
                            although these purchases are obviously for export to Argentina, are not
                            happy about refusing Chilean enterprises because of the political
                            pressure and feeling the latter can arouse.</p>
                        <p>I request authorization to write the following letter to the American
                            copper companies which they can use to brake excessive demands for

                        <p>We have asked the Buenos Aires Embassy to verify rumors that Argentina
                            has more than sufficient stocks on hand at the present time. Mark Lamb,
                            representing the New York Steel Exchange, Argentina, is now endeavoring
                            to make a deal with the army workshops for copper, most of which will
                            receive only a minimum of fabrication: “claiming that he has the
                            approval of the American Embassy at Buenos Aires for the exclusive

                            which is already well supplied by sales agencies.[”]</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to this
                            Embassy’s strictly confidential despatch No. 4377 of March 11, 1942,
                            discussing the need for a control of Chilean copper exports to
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Since the date of the above despatch the problem of copper has assumed
                            increasing importance, both as to its reaching the hands of firms in
                            Argentina, unfriendly to the United States, and as regards the supply
                            now reaching this country which, if allowed to continue, will surpass
                            even the normal needs of the market. I also wish to refer to cable No.
                            681 of May 5, 6 p.m., sent by our Embassy in Santiago to the Department,
                            proposing assistance to the American copper companies in braking the
                            excessive demands of Argentina for copper.</p>
                        <p>In view of the immediate importance of this particular subject, I took
                            occasion to send a member of my staff, acquainted with the matter, on
                            the regular diplomatic courier trip to Santiago on Saturday, May 9. He
                            had the opportunity to discuss the entire question with Messrs. MacLean
                            and Gray of the Embassy staff in Santiago, with Mr. Horace Graham,
                            representative of the Metals Reserve Corporation and with Messrs. John
                            R. Cotter and Frank N. May of the Anaconda <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55"
                                facs="0069"/>Copper Corporation. It was agreed that the problem was
                            twofold. First, the question of control over shipments of raw copper,
                            principally in bar or ingot form, to the Argentine market to the end
                            that this copper would not reach the hands of pro-Axis entities. The
                            unanimous opinion regarding this feature was that Anaconda should
                            continue to make sales only from New York and that these would receive
                            the approval of the Embassy in Buenos Aires through their local
                            representative before they were consummated.</p>
                        <p>The second factor has to do with the sales in Argentina of Chilean
                            semi-manufactured copper by the Fábricas y Maestranzas del Ejército de
                            Chile (Chilean Army Workshops). The practice in brief is as follows: By
                            Chilean law the North American producing companies in that country are
                            required to sell in Chilean pesos the copper needed by domestic
                            industry. Presumably this means for domestic consumption. Consequently,
                            the Chilean Army Workshops are able to buy from Anaconda and probably
                            from Braden Copper Company, in those cases where fire-refined copper is
                            satisfactory, all of their needs to meet the Chilean market demands.
                            However, a very lucrative business both for intermediaries and the
                            Chilean Army Workshops has recently developed by reason of the following
                            practice. Since Anaconda will not sell in Chile and since in New York
                            they will only sell to regular copper consumers, intermediaries dealing
                            largely on a speculative basis are unable to make their purchases
                            direct. Hence, they contract with the Chilean Army Workshops to purchase
                            fixed tonnages of semi-manufactured copper. Occasionally this is in the
                            form of wire of relatively large gauge, at other times it is in strip or
                            sheets. Recently, however, since the income from the business is so
                            attractive, it is understood that the greater amount of this copper is
                            worked but very little, such as being rolled into very thick sheets or
                            strips. Under this situation the Chilean Army Workshops have been able
                            to purchase fairly substantial quantities of copper from Anaconda. They
                            then work it as above indicated and sell it in turn to the intermediary,
                            who exports the product to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>There is little or no control over the sales of this copper once it
                            reaches the Argentine market and the practice is clearly an abuse by all
                            of those engaged in the transaction.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, I venture to suggest that the Department may wish to advise
                            the Chilean Government that it considers that future sales of
                            semi-manufactured copper by the Chilean Army Workshops to intermediaries
                            not normally consumers of copper and subsequent exportation of this
                            copper to Argentina, should be discontinued inasmuch as: <list>

                                    to reach the hands of firms or entities unfriendly to the United

                                    perform all of the semi-manufacturing processes now performed by
                                    the Chilean Army Workshops; and, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) her
                                    present stocks of copper are sufficient probably to meet her
                                    minimum requirements for at least the rest of 1942; since (1)
                                    average normal imports of raw copper, brass and bronze are less
                                    than 6,000 metric tons. Argentina imported approximately 7,400
                                    metric tons of electrolytic copper and 300 tons of brass and
                                    bronze in 1941. Imports from January to April inclusive during
                                    1942 have been between 5,000 and 6.000 metric tons of
                                    electrolytic copper.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Chilean Government would be glad to cooperate as
                            above suggested and it would also relieve the American copper companies
                            of a constant problem as regards sales to the Chilean Army Workshops
                            which they know are to be re-sold to speculator intermediaries for
                            re-export to Argentina. I further believe that by this method an
                            effective control over Argentine copper imports can be maintained and
                            that at least no further shipments will reach the hands of Sema or other
                            unacceptable firms.</p>

                            Ambassador at Buenos Aires, a copy of which he sent directly to you,
                            regarding the continued need for control of Chilean exports to Argentina
                            of Chilean semi-manufactured copper.</p>
                        <p>The subject was further discussed in your despatch no. 3387 dated May 22,
                                1942<note n="72" xml:id="d64fn72">Not printed.</note> from which it
                            appeared that exports of such copper to Argentina have thus far this
                            year reached 5,000 tons, estimated to be nearly enough for the entire
                            year.</p>
                        <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0071"/>
                        <p>It is observed that the American Ambassador at Buenos Aires states that
                            the supply now reaching Argentina, if allowed to continue, will surpass
                            even the normal needs of the market. The Ambassador at Buenos Aires
                            likewise indicates the need for control to prevent such copper from
                            reaching pro-Axis entities, and he also mentions the Chilean law which
                            requires that copper needed by Chilean domestic industry must be sold in
                            Chilean pesos, presumably for domestic consumption only. It is noted
                            that the Chilean Army Workshops sell semi-manufactured copper to
                            intermediaries who then sell it in Argentina. The amount purchased and
                            handled by the Chilean Army Workshops is understood to be far beyond
                            Chilean needs.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador at Buenos Aires reports that there is little or no control
                            over the sales of such semi-fabricated copper once it reaches
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>It has been observed that the Chilean Under Secretary of Commerce<note
                                n="73" xml:id="d64fn73">Ricardo Heatley.</note> recently inquired of
                            the Anaconda Copper Corporation in Chile whether it would be prepared to
                            sell certain amounts of copper to the Chilean Army Workshops for
                            dollars. The Chilean law providing for the sale in Chilean pesos of
                            copper produced by foreign-owned corporations in Chile and needed by
                            Chilean domestic industry is apparently being interpreted not to apply
                            to copper ultimately destined for export.</p>
                        <p>You are requested in your discretion to remind the appropriate Chilean
                            authorities that the Government of the United States is making
                            arrangements for the extension of financial assistance to the copper
                            industry in Chile on a large scale in order to increase the production
                            of copper for the war effort and that it appears to this Government that
                            the uncontrolled distribution of copper in Argentina which is assisted
                            by entities in Chile is inconsistent with this developmental program.
                            You should point out that this Government considers, moreover, that it
                            is unfortunate that the Chilean Army Workshops should serve as an
                            intermediary for the delivery of semi-manufactured copper to Argentina
                            for uncontrolled distribution to purchasers, many of whom may be
                            pro-Axis entities. You may mention in this respect that the
                            participation of the Chilean Army Workshops in such activity appears
                            inconsistent with the asserted Chilean needs for war matériel which
                            presumably require the use of all Chilean Army Workshop facilities and,
                            in addition, the facilities of other countries from which the Chilean
                            Government desires to import such matériel.</p>

                        <p>After long discussions we have informed Government representatives that
                            no priorities can be expected for gold mining but that in gold ores
                            which contain some copper, we would recommend (1) reduction refining
                            charges from two cents to one cent for copper content in gold ores and
                            concentrates. In addition would feed as much material as possible to
                            local smelters purchasing f. o. b. smelter instead of f. o. b. ports in
                            cases where freight charges to smelters less than to ports giving them
                            credit freight differential and would eliminate charge for sacks used on
                            concentrates, (2) in spite of extremely high price <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0073"/>now being paid for copper concentrates
                            that we would recommend increase price copper concentrates by 5% and
                            copper ores by 10% and would eliminate sack charge on concentrates but
                            would not allow freight differential, (3) would recommend inclusion Los
                            Vilos as acceptable port against guarantee Miners Bank to increase
                            loading equipment and port facilities, (4) we would recommend increase
                            tolerances silica to 15% and copper to 0.35% in manganese ores with
                            penalties if any fixed by Washington.</p>
                        <p>We stated that in our opinion moment was not opportune for extension
                            contract to 3 years and that there would be no further concessions. In
                            addition unless world prices increase considerably that no material
                            revision could be expected upon termination second 6 months period.
                            Naturally they are quite discontented terms indicated and are
                            particularly anxious to have us develop some way to aid gold mining
                            industry in which problem unemployment will soon develop. They use
                            arguments good neighbor and hemisphere solidarity. Original prices set
                            for copper, manganese, mercury were generous and in excess prices we
                            would have offered if Japanese situation had not existed. In case gold
                            prices were low because ore buyers and Japanese were not purchasing this
                            material at time we made the contract. These gold ores are valuable for
                            use as flux in present smelting operations Chagres and Naltagua and
                            probably of value for shipment to Tacoma under ordinary peace conditions
                            and commercial freight rates. We have endeavored to find some way that
                            we could recommend to aid these gold mining operations but aside from
                            suggestions above which aid some gold producers sufficiently but in some
                            cases especially gold mines Coquimbo and Atacama Districts give no aid
                            at all we are unable to suggest any scheme unless for special
                            considerations you feel some help might be given. Please advise.[”]</p>

                        <p>American companies are doing their best to restrict deliveries and refuse
                            orders from newcomers but are under heavy pressure and their position is
                            none too strong in view of the provision in the copper tax law which
                            obliges them to supply the local market.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy has pointed out to the Chilean authorities that shortage of
                            copper is critical and any diversion to nonessential uses directly
                            affects our war production. Also that the entire output of Anaconda and
                            Braden has been purchased by our Government. However, I am convinced
                            Chile will not establish effective control over either domestic
                            consumption or exports unless we take a really strong stand.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request authorization to inform the Chilean Government
                            officially that it is imperative a mutual agreement be reached promptly
                            fixing the quantities of copper that will be supplied for domestic needs
                            and for export such quantities to be based on a study of the essential
                            requirements of Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Furthermore, that pending
                            the results of such a study Anaconda and Braden have been instructed to
                            make no deliveries without the approval of the Embassy which will
                            consult with the appropriate Chilean authorities.</p>

                            prices and we believe discussions should be confined strictly to price
                            changes or matters related directly thereto such as sack charges,
                            freights, delivery points, etc.</p>
                        <p>While not wishing finally to close door on question of gold mines and
                            while requesting your further views on this subject present reaction of
                            agencies here including State Department is adverse to any change.
                            Incidentally feel it would be very embarrassing if further encouragement
                            given and then export of equipment and supplies prohibited <pb n="61"

                        <p>Although we ask you do not make final commitment for moment believe we
                            can gain acceptance here of points you have said you would recommend if
                            this would settle the matter but prefer if possible omit Los Vilos as
                            acceptable port as impossible under present shipping conditions to
                            arrange vessels call at minor ports and we would thus either have to pay
                            higher local transshipment to larger ports or leave stocks there until
                            end of war.</p>
                        <p>Assume you have definitely disposed of Chilean proposals 4, 5 and 6 and

                        <p>1273. For Bridgman, Metals Reserve:</p>
                        <p>“Reference your cable August 4 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>]. We have
                            discussed your cable fully with Minister of Commerce, President Caja
                            Crédito Minero, President National Mining Society and group of Chilean
                            engineers appointed as experts. We have explained fully existing
                            situation and particularly the impossibility of further aid gold mines
                            in view priorities situation. We definitely refused accept Los Vilos as
                            port but stated we would again review situation in 6 months time if port
                            had been improved. Caja Crédito has stopped some gold mines and is
                            devoting attention to increase copper production. In this regard they
                            wish permission to increase tolerances in copper concentrates from 35
                            grams gold to 60 grams gold as they state they can in this way treat
                            copper ores 4 to 5 percent containing 10 to 15 grams gold and make
                            concentrates from materials that are now not being exploited and absorb
                            some of unemployment gold mines. Instead 5% on concentrates and 10% on
                            ores which is price increase we suggested they request 8% and 15%
                            respectively. All other matters settled. In view of this situation we
                            recommend you allow tolerances up to 60 grams gold on copper
                            concentrates and offer increased price copper ores and copper
                            concentrates 6% and 12% respectively. We believe on this basis we can
                            close arrangement immediately and would appreciate your prompt
                            attention.”</p>

                            concessions also to review Los Vilos as a port in 6 months if
                            improvements have been made. Agree to 6% increase on copper
                            concentrates. Also agree to increase of 12% on copper ores if absolutely
                            necessary but as present price we are paying for copper ores is already
                            higher than any we are paying elsewhere hope you can hold to 10%
                            increase. You are authorized to close the matter on the above basis.

                                xml:id="d71fn79">Not printed.</note> You are authorized to proceed
                            on the basis outlined in your 1241, July 31. Anaconda people here advise
                            that they have been informed Chilean Government wishes to purchase
                            amounts available for export to other American republics (other than
                            this country) and sell them directly. This approach is obviously
                            attractive to the Chilean authorities, since it gives them an
                            opportunity for a profit and also gives them basis for bartering for
                            scarce materials from the other countries. While it would be greatly
                            preferable to eliminate this transaction, you are authorized to consent
                            to such an arrangement if necessary for an agreement. In the event Chile
                            seeks an excessive price from the other republics, matter could be
                            called to attention of proper Chilean authorities asking that reasonable
                            price be maintained.</p>
                        <p>It is important that you continue to stress the serious shortage of
                            copper and the urgent need of keeping to the absolute minimum both
                            Chilean consumption and exports to the other republics; diversion from
                            direct war effort would be impossible to justify.</p>
                        <p>The Embassies at Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires have been told the
                            current rate of exports from Chile to Brazil and Argentina and asked
                            whether such amounts are necessary for indispensable needs. You will be
                            advised of replies. It is believed here that any more careful study
                            could not be completed in time to present an early settlement of this
                            important problem.</p>
                        <p>Metals Reserve suggests that Graham participate in these discussions so
                            that it may be fully informed upon his arrival, and that you may find
                            Miller helpful in that connection after Graham’s departure.</p>

                            is believed particularly desirable that Graham be fully informed in

                            which were presented to Foreign Office in note August 20. Minister
                            appreciates importance of agreement <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0079"/>fixing quantity copper which American companies will
                            supply both for domestic consumption and for export from Chile in
                            fabricated form. He emphasized that Chile’s only desire is to fabricate
                            its copper in its own plants and that to the extent that is possible
                            imports by Argentina and Brazil from other sources should be reduced so
                            no increase in total consumption would result. Minister stated however,
                            that Colonel Lord gave definite assurances he would send expert from the
                            United States to make necessary studies and he has asked Chilean Embassy
                            by telegraph to request that this be done. He was surprised and somewhat
                            concerned with statement that no more copper needed from Chile this year
                            by Argentina which has been principal export market. Minister pointed
                            out that situation had been complicated because of Government’s
                            inability to obtain any satisfactory response from American companies
                            particularly Anaconda. Problem will be discussed further when Chilean
                            Embassy’s reply is received.</p>
                        <p>Regarding proposal that Embassy be consulted before American companies
                            accept orders and before Government issues export permits, Minister of
                            Commerce stated reply would have to come from Foreign Office with which
                            Embassy is taking up matter.</p>
                        <p>To relieve pressure temporarily Anaconda has agreed to accept orders
                            approved by Chilean Government up to 1,000 tons.</p>

                        <p>1431. Your telegram No. 712, June 20, 2 p.m.<note n="82" xml:id="d75fn82"
                                >Not printed.</note> Embassy has been approached by both Heatley,
                            Under Secretary of Commerce and Wennerberg, Swedish Chargé d’Affaires
                            regarding attitude our Government towards exchange of Chilean copper for
                            Swedish products. Wennerberg has informed Heatley that British
                            Government has agreed to issue navicerts for 2,500 tons copper per
                            quarter for Sweden. Commercial Secretary of British Embassy,
                                Santiago,<note n="83" xml:id="d75fn83">Arthur J. Pack.</note> says
                            this allegation is not correct and that British Government will not
                            issue navicerts for copper to Sweden without prior consultation with
                            Department. Commercial Secretary states a navicert was issued for 2,500
                            tons of copper for Sweden for first quarter 1942 but none will have been
                            issued subsequently.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>This Embassy believes no further navicerts should be issued for copper to
                            Sweden because of need for copper in the United States and danger of
                            copper consigned to Sweden falling into the hands of Germany.</p>
                        <p>If Department agrees telegraph authorization to inform Heatley that
                            United States cannot give its approval to proposed transaction.<note

                            during a conversation with Under Secretary of Commerce September 3.
                            Under Secretary stated reply had been drafted but apparently did not
                            feel free to divulge its contents. Meanwhile he showed copy of telegram
                            from Chilean Embassy, Washington, stating that Colonel Lord’s assurance
                            had been discussed with Mr. Soulies of Board of Economic Warfare who
                            said a man would be sent to Chile within a month to study the situation
                            regarding copper and other Chilean products. Under Secretary asked that
                            discussions concerning quality copper to be delivered in Chile be
                            postponed until this man arrives. Please telegraph whether Embassy’s
                            report is correct and Department’s views.</p>

                        <p>1486. Embassy’s telegram No. 1441, September 5, 7 p.m. Foreign Office
                            reply to note of August 20 merely states that Embassy will be <pb n="67"
                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0081"/>informed shortly of plan for regulating
                            supplies of copper for national industries which has been prepared by
                            Ministry Commerce and that Chilean Ambassador at Washington has
                            telegraphed that within a month Board of Economic Warfare will send
                            expert to Chile to study distribution of copper to South American
                            countries. All [<hi rend="italic">Also?</hi>] referred to Embassy’s
                            suggestion that pending an agreement Embassy be consulted before
                            acceptance orders by American producers or issuance export permits is
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>From discussions with Minister of Commerce it seems clear that the
                            regulations referred to will not go beyond the establishment of
                            specifications covering the products which fabricators must make in
                            order to obtain supplies of bar copper. The purport of the regulations
                            will be to ensure work for local plants by requiring more than
                            elementary fabrication.</p>
                        <p>While there is continued threat that new legislation will be introduced
                            eliminating all possible doubt as to the obligation copper producers to
                            deliver whatever quantity local industries desire and particularly of
                            other acute problems concerning nitrate price and petroleum supplies, it
                            does not appear desirable to force the issue at this time. With
                            Embassy’s consent Anaconda will, therefore, indicate its willingness to
                            accept Government approved orders for a second month up to maximum of
                            1500 tons. This it agreed to on August 19 for 1 month but orders
                            received have fallen short by 300 tons and it appears doubtful whether
                            maximum quantity will be [apparent omission].</p>
                        <p>As Embassy cannot act effectively without definite advice regarding
                            sending of expert please telegraph urgently whether this will [be]
                            done.</p>

                            that Kemnitzer<note n="87" xml:id="d79fn87">Presumably William J.

                            accept orders from new firm an understanding must be reached as quickly
                            as possible. Telegraph urgently when Kemnitzer will arrive, whether the
                            Department expects him to handle copper problem and whether he has
                            received definite instructions.</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult to deny Chile enough of its own copper to cover its
                            domestic consumption of about 3,000 tons, plus whatever part of
                            Argentina’s and Brazil’s import requirements, estimated at 10,000 and
                            11,000 tons respectively of copper metal, she may be able to sell them
                            in fabricated form. The latter quantity cannot be determined in advance.
                            When Chilean fabricators requests copper the Government naturally
                            assumes they have a market for their products. It uses the argument that
                            no increase in total consumption will result if exports of copper metal
                            are reduced by a quantity corresponding to exports of fabricated
                            copper.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, it seems evident that any limitation on
                            deliveries of copper for fabrication in Chile would have to be made
                            arbitrarily. Embassy believes that it would be wise not to agree to any
                            delivery schedule for more than 3 months for which period present
                            figures of 1500 tons per month might be continued if it should be
                            impossible to obtain agreement on a lower amount. If Chilean fabricators
                            buy more than they are able to sell profitably they will, presumably,
                            not continue their purchases. More effective control over the ultimate
                            destination of copper sold for export appears more important than any
                            limitation on quantity which could be obtained. This aspect will of
                            course be stressed in our discussions.</p>
                        <p>In making the above suggestion account has been taken of the fact that we
                            cannot push too hard without risking new legislation which would
                            definitely obligate the American producers to supply whatever quantity
                            local industries require either for domestic consumption or for export
                            in fabricated form.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s views are requested.</p>

                            participation of Miller, representative of Metals Reserve.</p>
                        <p>Copper problem has been further complicated by demand for 500 tons per
                            month from Valdivia Steel Company in which Government has large
                            interest. This quantity is in addition to the 1500 tons per month to
                            which Anaconda tentatively agreed and its delivery is required by decree
                            issued by Minister of Fomento [apparent omission] economy.</p>
                        <p>Undersecretary has now given Embassy text of proposed decree, reference
                            my despatch 4618 of today’s date,<note n="88" xml:id="d80fn89">Not
                                printed.</note> regulating copper purchases whose principal
                            provisions are as follows: (1) provision of copper tax law requiring
                            producers to supply Chilean industries includes latters needs both for
                            export and for domestic market; (2) all orders must be approved by
                            Ministry of Economy and the copper used only for fabrication, sale in
                            original form being prohibited; (3) producers must reserve up to 20,000
                            tons per annum or such other quantity as President may fix, to fill
                            approved orders.</p>
                        <p>Consider it impossible to obtain modification provision (1) above and
                            other general provisions appear advantageous. The question therefore is
                            to limit the minimum the quantity producers must deliver. Requests
                            presented to Government now exceed 2,000 tons per month. Attempt will be
                            made to obtain agreement to 1500 tons per month without right to carry
                            over any portion not ordered and on condition that Government furnish
                            Embassy promptly details of all export permits issued, but it may be
                            necessary to agree to 1666 tons or annual basis 20,000 tons as specified
                            in draft decree. As purchasers must pay cash and there is a limit to
                            sales possibilities it is hoped that after immediate demand is satisfied
                            orders will fall off.</p>
                        <p>If Department has instructions to give, telegraph immediately as decision

                        <p>1207. Your 1609, October 2, noon. The Department and other interested
                            agencies of this Government have been giving their most earnest
                            consideration to the problem of determining the minimum amount of
                            Chilean copper which can be diverted from supplies required in our war
                            effort and still satisfy the legitimate needs of Chile and of other
                            American republics normally supplied by Chile. The reaching of a
                            satisfactory agreement on this point would be a demonstration of Chile’s
                            willingness to cooperate in this phase of the war effort. The Department
                            authorizes you to discuss with the appropriate authorities of the
                            Chilean Government a figure of 20,000 tons per annum as representing our
                            considered judgment of requirements for Chilean internal consumption and
                            for export principally to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In reaching this figure the necessity for a reduction in the normal
                            civilian consumption of copper under war conditions has been balanced
                            against the legitimate role to be played by copper fabricators in Chile
                            and in other American republics in supplying certain articles which the
                            United States and other non-South American suppliers are no longer able
                            to furnish.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the United Nations desperately need every ounce of copper
                            which can be obtained for military purposes. Consequently any
                            unnecessary diversion of copper to civilian users directly and
                            unfavorably affects the war effort. This Government has been seriously
                            preoccupied with the increasingly large diversion of Chilean copper into
                            uses which can not be termed essential, both in Chile and in Argentina
                            as well as possibly in other countries. In considering this problem, the
                            Department is fully aware of the price situation and of the further fact
                            that it is reasonable to suppose that there has been some hoarding of
                            copper for speculating purposes.</p>
                        <p>At the same time that you approach Chilean authorities on this matter of
                            a specific amount of copper for the purpose mentioned, you should
                            indicate that in the event those authorities believe an agreement is
                            possible, this Government will be disposed to assign a representative or
                            representatives (probably Graham of Metals Reserve) to discuss details
                            such as allocations to companies and to markets with the appropriate
                            Chilean authorities. The Department recognizes of course that these are
                            matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chilean Government but
                            believes that, once the Chilean <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0085"
                            />Government has indicated its willingness to cooperate, the necessary
                            details can only be worked out through joint conversations.</p>
                        <p>This matter is regarded as one of the utmost importance.</p>

                            methods to make the copper available to Brazil. Our information is to
                            the effect that Brazil still has adequate stocks and that Lend-Lease is
                            shipping War Ministry over 5 million pounds last quarter of this year.
                            Consequently the urgent pressure of the Brazilian War Ministry to obtain
                            copper in Chile does not seem warranted. If the Department is able to
                            have the copper released to Merry del Val Company, it should not be
                            considered a precedent in as much as the Department does not approve of
                            such copper transactions except directly between manufacturers and
                            consumers. Moreover, in the future, Chile should supply Brazil’s needs
                            in accordance with procedures outlined in Department’s telegram no.

                        <p>1698. Confirming my conversation this afternoon with Duggan.<note n="91"
                                xml:id="d83fn91">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on Political
                                Relations.</note> Your telegram 1221, October 12, 2 [<hi
                                rend="italic">11</hi>] p.m.</p>
                        <p>Instructions came from Ministry of War Brazil for purchase through Merry
                            del Val Company and conveyed to me by Brazilian Ambassador. In your
                            telegram No. 1121, September 25, 8 p.m. you said Metals Reserve had
                            agreed to instruct Anaconda to sell amount asked, and I so informed the
                            Ambassador. Your No. 1221 puts me in a most embarrassing position since
                            my relations with Brazilian Ambassador are very close and constant and
                            it happens that Merry del Val is his son-in-law. I feel strongly that it
                            will be a serious mistake to ignore your No. 1121 at this stage and
                            result in resentment of Ambassador with whom it is of the utmost
                            importance that I <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0086"/>maintain the
                            closest and friendliest relations. There seems no doubt that the order
                            is genuine and from Brazil’s Ministry of War. Whatever may result in the
                            future urge that this one order be put through.</p>

                                specialist of the Department of Agriculture on guayule.</note> Have
                            been asked to remain here few days longer than planned. Representing
                            Chilean Ministry Agriculture Señor Manuel Elgueta requests formal
                            agreement guaranteeing market for such guayule and kok-saghyz rubber as
                            may be produced in Chile. I beg to submit the following suggestion as
                            basis for possible negotiation providing it would be in line with
                            policies of our Government; the United States Government agrees for
                            period of 10 years from November 1, 1942 to exchange ton for ton best
                            grade of butadiene synthetic rubber for high grade but no deresined
                            natural rubber produced in Chile from guayule or kok-saghyz on the basis
                            of actual rubber content up to limit of Chile’s requirement of synthetic
                            rubber for fabrication in Chile, and likewise agrees during said period
                            of 10 years to purchase entire excess Chilean guayule and kok-saghyz
                            rubber above amount required for fabrication in Chile at price then
                            current in the United States for such rubber or at price then current in
                            the United States for butadiene synthetic rubber, whichever may be most
                            advantageous to Chile. I would appreciate receiving your views in this
                            matter prior to my departure for Argentina. [Bartlett.]</p>

                            brass, or bronze for necessary domestic requirements now, after taking
                            fully into consideration the necessity that Chile, as well as all of the
                            other American republics, should eliminate all nonessential consumption
                            of copper.</p>
                        <p>It is the earnest desire of the Department that these things be
                            accomplished by mutual agreement. Under no circumstances are the above
                            suggestions to be interpreted as a failure to recognize the sovereign
                            right of the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>This matter is regarded as one of pressing importance. You are requested
                            to discuss it on an urgent basis with appropriate officials of the
                            Chilean Government and to inform the Department at the earliest
                            practicable date of the results of your representations.</p>

                        <p>1312. Your 1798, October 22. Suggestion by Bartlett of basis for possible
                            negotiation of rubber agreement is regarded unfavorably. Proposal does
                            not offer substantial net increases in rubber available for war effort.
                            In fact larger amounts would be available from Guayule plantings in
                            other areas where there would be no obligation to deliver synthetic in
                            exchange. This Government in general would not favor a rubber agreement
                            at this time unless there is a likelihood of securing thereby
                            substantial amounts of rubber which would not otherwise be

                            promptly by telegraph for the information of the United States
                            Commercial Company data concerning raw materials being purchased or
                            believed susceptible of purchase by enemy countries, as well as
                            shipments going to neutral and non-belligerent countries believed
                            ultimately destined to enemy countries.</p>
                        <p>So far as pre-emptive buying is concerned, the principal group of
                            products which would be of interest to enemy countries, namely metals
                            and minerals, appears already to be adequately covered by existing
                            contracts, notably the contract concluded by the Metals Reserve Company.
                            As for other products, there are few except wool, hemp and limited
                            quantities of hides and skins which Chile is in position to export, and
                            the Embassy has no reason to believe that purchases of these commodities
                            have been made by enemy agents or that shipments have been reaching
                            enemy countries, either directly or indirectly.</p>
                        <p>The only possible exception to what has just been said is in the case of
                            copper which, as the Department knows, has been going in considerable
                            quantities to Argentina and in some instances is known to have reached
                            firms in that country which are included in the Proclaimed List. Whether
                            or not any of this copper has subsequently been reexported from
                            Argentina to destinations from which it might eventually reach the enemy
                            is, of course, a matter for the Buenos Aires Embassy to determine.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy will continue to be on the alert with respect to the
                            activity of enemy agents and of cloaks for the latter and will
                            investigate carefully all transactions which appear to be in any way
                            questionable.</p>
                        <p>So far as shipments from Chile to countries outside the Western
                            Hemisphere are concerned, such information as is obtainable locally <pb
                                n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0090"/>is being reported regularly and
                            in the Embassy airgram No. A–314, October 31, 2 p.m.,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d88fn6">Not printed.</note> it was pointed out that the
                            British Embassy transmits immediately to London full information
                            regarding all shipments from Chile to Europe in connection with the
                            navicerts system and that data regarding such shipments not only from
                            Chile but from all other Latin American countries should be readily
                            available at the British Ministry of Economic Warfare.</p>

                        <p>1334. The Department’s 1296, October 28, 8 p.m. and your 1849, October
                            30, 11 p.m.<note n="7" xml:id="d89fn7">Latter not printed.</note> A
                            meeting was held in the Department on November 4 with the participation
                            of Horace Graham to discuss the Chilean copper export and internal
                            consumption problem. The Department does not desire to present to the
                            Chilean Government any formula which might offend their sensibilities or
                            lead them to believe that we are endeavoring to encroach on their rights
                            by spelling out to the last detail what we feel it is desirable in the
                            interest of hemispheric security to achieve. Although it is considered
                            essential that copper availabilities be conserved to the optimum degree
                            possible and as a corollary to this that shipments not be made to
                            countries where sufficient stocks already exist (such as Argentina,
                            where 8,000 tons are apparently now in the hands of speculators) or
                            where the supplies would be dissipated, some plan of distribution must
                            necessarily be incidental to any orderly treatment of the problem.
                            Consequently, please consider the percentage figures given in the
                            Department’s 1296 not as final and binding but rather as informative and
                            as couched to form the basis of discussion for the achievement of a
                            formula which would be mutually acceptable.</p>
                        <p>In Graham’s estimation (and the Department agrees with him), the 20,000
                            short ton figure is an eminently fair and just one and one which the
                            Chileans should be willing to accept. Consequently, unless you perceive
                            controlling reasons to the contrary, it is preferred that you adhere to
                            this over-all figure. Nevertheless, the Department would be willing to
                            go along with reasonable adjustments in the breakdown percentage
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes to make it clear that the 20,000 short ton figure
                            is not considered to be the amount which will supply all South <pb
                                n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0091"/>American needs, but rather simply
                            the amount which Chile would contribute toward the satisfaction of those
                            requirements, including Chilean requirements.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that, if the Chilean Government would agree to a formula
                            which would in general approximate that given in the Department’s 1296,
                            our ends could be satisfactorily achieved. However, it is essential that
                            we know in advance what shipments are anticipated and to what countries
                            in order that adjustments may be made on shipments from this country.
                            Consequently, it is hoped that you will be able to convince your Chilean
                            friends that the Embassy should be informed when shipments are
                            contemplated in order that you may inform the Department. Please explain
                            to the Chileans that we quite understand that we have no right to demand
                            that such reports be made but that we would consider it a friendly and
                            cooperative gesture in keeping with Chile’s expressed desires to render
                            all possible assistance in continental solidarity and security.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes to make it clear that this telegram and previous
                            telegrams on this subject are intended as suggestions looking to the
                            achievement of the ends we seek and not as final proposals which
                            preclude deviation. Our desire is to (1) limit Chilean internal
                            consumption and exports to 20,000 short tons; (2) provide a workable
                            export control; and (3) provide this Government with sufficient advance
                            notice of shipments. If you are able to evolve with the Chilean
                            authorities an alternate formula along these lines, and provided the one
                            already suggested is not acceptable, please inform the Department.</p>

                        <p>1338. Your 1698, October 13, 6 p.m. War Production Board and Metals
                            Reserve have agreed to the release of 2,621 short tons of copper to
                            Brazilian War Arsenals through the Merry del Val Company, but formal
                            release is delayed pending receipt of an agreed delivery schedule.
                            Please consult Merry del Val and Anaconda and advise whether following
                            suggested schedule is feasible and satisfactory: 621 in November; 1000
                            in December; 1000 in January; all short tons. As War Production Board is
                            particularly desirous that shipment be spread over three or more months,
                            it is hoped Merry del Val will have no objection.</p>

                            apparently to limit 1943 local manufactures for domestic consumption and
                            export to 1,500 metric tons monthly although figure over double 1942
                            consumption. They were unwilling to state in decree the prerequisite
                            requirement that exporters indicate ultimate consumer “because of
                            internal political reasons” but Minister agreed to institute such
                            requirement and so inform the Embassy by letter. Other desired export

                        <p>It developed that Argentine Ambassador has recently requested 1,500 tons

                            large stocks in Argentina. Chile will probably reply agreeing to supply
                            manufactured copper. It seems apparent that Chile hopes for a
                            considerable extension of export business now so favorable to
                            manufactures here because of price differentials and that is the real
                            reason behind desire not to state limit of 1,500 metric tons monthly,
                            which they probably hope to exceed as the year advances.</p>

                        <p>183. Department’s 85, January 22.<note n="12" xml:id="d93fn12">Not
                                printed; this instruction concerned allocations of commodities, and
                                requested names of consignees.</note> In view of the lack of any
                            Chilean agency enjoying either the necessary authority or
                            qualifications, and particularly in view of the unsatisfactory results
                            obtained by the Embassy’s own strenuous efforts over a period of months,
                            I am convinced that the advance detailed information requested cannot be
                            supplied in time to be of value. The National Supplies Board states that
                            it would require at least 6 months to detail consignees, quantities and
                            uses of allocated commodities and I strongly question whether even then
                            complete data would be available. It took the Tin Rationing Commission 7
                            months to compile the data submitted. Embassy’s partial compilation of
                            legitimate importers and users of only three primary iron and steel
                            products includes 230 names in Santiago, Valparaiso area alone. It is
                            manifestly impossible to telegraph such extensive data.</p>
                        <p>Some more practical plan must be adopted for Chile and I definitely feel
                            that the most effective method of exercising adequate control of
                            distribution and restricted use will be through the Certificate of
                            Necessity covered by the Department’s memorandum of January 14.<note
                                n="13" xml:id="d93fn13">Not found in Department files.</note> The
                            allocations made to date are sufficiently low to prevent diversion of
                            materials to nonessential uses. The problem is to keep essential
                            industries going.</p>
                        <p>The following plan discussed by Minister of Commerce<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d93fn14">Arturo Riveros Alcaide.</note> and the National
                            Supplies Board with the Embassy would accomplish the <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0094"/>desired result: as soon as possible
                            after the election of February 1 the Government would create rationing
                            commissions—starting with iron and steel, rubber and chemicals—with full
                            power phase of distribution of all allocated commodities. A
                            representative of importers, an American citizen where available, would
                            be on each commission to keep Embassy in constant touch. Importers would
                            apply to appropriate commission which if it approved would recommend
                            that the National Supplies issue Certificate of Necessity. Board would
                            consult with Embassy prior to issuance of any certificate. The first
                            certificates would cover orders already pending in the United States for
                            which Exchange Control Board during the past months has authorized
                            opening of letters of credit. Later, if administrative difficulties
                            arise owing to the large number of individual importers, it may be
                            necessary to consider temporarily canalizing trade in the hands of a
                            limited number of selected firms.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Commerce has emphasized to the Embassy that he hopes at
                            the beginning the authorities in Washington will allow some flexibility
                            as regards the certificates and will accept them even if not complete in
                            all details. Eventually the projected rationing commissions will be able
                            to answer fully all the questions on each certificate but at first this
                            will be difficult owing to lack of organization. The Minister assures
                            the Embassy that the rationing commissions will restrict the use of
                            scarce materials to the essential needs of the national economy; in any
                            event the Embassy will review all certificates before issuance and our
                            objection will automatically suspend action.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government is sufficiently concerned over the shortage of
                            materials so that we can feel certain of absolute cooperation.</p>
                        <p>I recommend strongly that our authorities: (1), waive the pre-information
                            requested in telegraphic instruction No. 85 as regards allocated
                            commodities, (2), approve the system of rationing commissions acting
                            under constant and close Embassy supervision which is outlined above,
                            and (3), accept as valid Certificates of Necessity issued during the
                            first quarter of 1942 even though during the organization period of the
                            rationing commissions they may not be complete in every detail.</p>
                        <p>This recommendation is made after a particularly careful study of the
                            problem from every angle and numerous lengthy discussion the Chilean
                            authorities. Unless some such simplified and accelerated procedure is
                            approved promptly we may precipitate an economic and political mess in
                            this strategically important country.</p>

                        <p>415. Misunderstanding apparently occurred regarding plan outlined
                            Embassy’s telegram number 183 January 30, 5 p.m. for controlling
                            distribution allocated commodities through Certificates Necessity.
                            Minister Commerce and National Supplies Board now state they did not
                            intend that rationing committees should decide distribution before
                            issuance of certificates but only upon arrival goods. They point out
                            that allocations are below Chile’s need, that regardless of certificates
                            committees will have power to impose whatever distribution seems
                            necessary when shipments arrive and that compliance with policies laid
                            down by United States will be assured since no decisions will be made
                            without concurrence committee member approved by Embassy. Rationing
                            committees will not be set up before new administration takes office
                            April 2d and some time will elapse before they really function.
                            Meanwhile supplies are urgently needed especially of iron and steel.</p>
                        <p>Minister Commerce asks approval following procedure regarding iron and
                            steel allocations which he insists is only practical method of getting
                            shipments moving promptly. The balance of the allotment for each iron
                            and steel group after deducting the quantities for which certificates
                            have already been issued would be divided between the few principal
                            importers, the railroads and Fomento Corporation to whom certificates
                            would of necessity be issued stipulating that final distribution shall
                            be made by rationing committee. These firms would obligate themselves to
                            make delivery only to approved consumers for essential uses as
                            instructed by committee which would also fix prices. Some certificates
                            have already been issued to Fomento on that basis. Although Minister’s
                            proposal now covers only iron and steel, it must be presumed that if
                            accepted it will be extended to other commodities for which rationing
                            commissions are created.</p>
                        <p>Obviously the procedure differs widely from ideas of American control
                            authorities. However since iron and steel must arrive soon if
                            unemployment is to be avoided and experience has clearly demonstrated
                            inability Chilean Government to act promptly, it is recommended that
                            Minister’s proposal be agreed to for first half of 1942 which would give
                            rationing committees time to organize and gather necessary data. But
                            Government should be officially informed that for second half year
                            United States will not clear shipments allocated commodities unless
                            ultimate consumer and use are shown in Certificates of Necessity. It is
                            to be remembered that this is an interim government and until the new
                            government takes office on April <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0096"

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a list of the
                            commodities allocated to Chile<note n="17" xml:id="d95fn17">Not
                                printed.</note> for the second quarter of 1942. Iron and steel
                            products, and some other additional items, will be announced
                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>The allocations, as shown, are based largely on the recommendations of
                            your Mission; and in this connection the Department wishes to express to
                            you and your staff its great appreciation of the reports on essential
                            requirements which have been submitted by your office. It is hoped that
                            the reporting officers will continue to spare no effort to supply the
                            Department with this vitally important information. A questionnaire is
                            being prepared for your guidance in collecting and analyzing the type of
                            information of most value to the agencies in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Department is aware that our Missions have been handicapped by lack
                            of information as to the exact procedure followed in the War Production
                            Board and the Office of Export Control with regard to allocations and
                            the licensing for export of allocated commodities. The following is
                            designed to explain the background of the allocations system and to give
                            the Missions a picture of the situation as it exists today.</p>
                        <p>Last January it was necessary to announce allocations before the
                            machinery to administer them was set up. Following their announcement,
                            the War Production Board began trying to fit allocations into production
                            schedules. This proved to be so complicated, in view of the rapid
                            conversion of industries to war production, that in effect there was no
                            fixed allocations procedure during the first quarter of the year. The
                            War Production Board, conscious of the necessity of <pb n="83"
                                xml:id="pg_83" facs="0097"/>providing for the other American
                            republics, proceeded on the basis of priority ratings, and it is
                            gratifying to record that very substantial quantities of exports moved
                            forward during a most difficult period.</p>
                        <p>During the first quarter, at the suggestion of this Government, the other
                            American republics set up Certifying Agencies, most of which are now
                            functioning. It has developed rather logically that in many countries
                            the Certificates have become corollary to systems organized to supervise
                            or control the equitable distribution and the price of the commodities
                            upon arrival. Thus, as is evident from despatches received by the
                            Department, the foreign governments are concerned as to the treatment
                            accorded the Certificates by the Office of Export Control.</p>
                        <p>In the first quarter the Office of Export Control approved thousands of
                            applications with and without accompanying Certificates of Necessity.
                            The flow of production and export is a continuous process and could not
                            be held up pending receipt of Certificates. The latter are only now
                            beginning to arrive in substantial numbers. Many of the commodities so
                            licensed have been shipped, others are at seaboard awaiting bottoms,
                            while others are still awaiting their turn for manufacture. Statistics
                            are in preparation to show how much of each allocated commodity was
                            licensed or shipped to each country during the first quarter of
                            1942.</p>
                        <p>The large number of outstanding licenses not covered by Certificates
                            presents a most complicated problem particularly in the matter of
                            coordinating these licenses with the efforts of the Certifying Agencies
                            and control systems in the other American republics. Attempt to recall
                            or invalidate all outstanding licenses not covered by Certificates might
                            result in interruption to the flow of manufacture and export. There must
                            be a transition period during which, concurrent with the approval of
                            licenses covered by certificates, the non-certified outstanding licenses
                            can be worked off. The extent of this transition period cannot be
                            determined at this time, but it may extend as long as through the second
                            quarter, or until September 1, 1942.</p>
                        <p>These problems, and the questions they involve, have actively concerned
                            the several interested agencies of the Government for several months;
                            and the Department, the War Production Board, and the Board of Economic
                            Warfare are still trying to work out a practicable allocations and
                            licensing procedure for the second and subsequent quarters of the year.
                            The successful merging of the existing unsatisfactory procedure and a
                            new improved procedure constitutes an administrative problem of the
                            first magnitude; the readjustment must be made while administrative
                            processes carry on.</p>
                        <p>The Department is pleased to be able to inform you that the production
                            phase of the allocations system is being worked out rapidly <pb n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84" facs="0098"/>and satisfactorily by the War Production
                            Board. An announcement will shortly be made of a procedure which will
                            (1) require manufacturers of an allocated commodity to reserve a
                            definite portion of their production facilities to accommodate foreign
                            orders within the overall total of the allocation for the industry; (2)
                            require manufacturers to accept foreign orders that have been licensed
                            for export; and (3) help the agents in the United States of foreign
                            customers to find a manufacturer in the event difficulty is experienced
                            in placing the order. Owing to the complexity of modern industrial
                            organization, the implementing of orders issued by the War Production
                            Board may be slightly different as regards different commodities, and
                            announcements will be made in the near future with respect to fixed
                            booking dates, etc., for orders to fit into production schedules for
                            certain forward periods.</p>
                        <p>As for the licensing procedure, and the relation of the Certificate of
                            Necessity thereto, the administrative problem is especially difficult.
                            It is nevertheless hoped that an announcement will soon be made of a
                            procedure which will provide the following: (1) During the transition
                            period of working off the outstanding un-certified licenses, and in
                            order to give certain of the other American republics more time to
                            organize their Certifying Agencies, the Office of Export Control will
                            give definite preference to those license applications covered by
                            Certificates; (2) After a certain date the Office of Export Control will
                            approve only those new applications for license to export which are
                            covered by Certificates of Necessity (Confidential: this is the position
                            being urged by the Department but there is no definite assurance as yet
                            that the Board of Economic Warfare will agree). Thus it is hoped that
                            during the third quarter and thereafter there will be a close
                            coordination between the issuance of licenses and the issuance of
                            Certificates of Necessity so as to enable the other governments to plan
                            effectively the most advantageous distribution of scarce commodities
                            within their economic systems.</p>
                        <p>With regard to other aspects of the allocations and licensing system the
                            Department desires to give the following information in answer to
                            specific questions presented by the Missions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Certificate of Necessity is to be used only for allocated
                                    commodities. However, the Board of Economic Warfare has by <hi

                                    5, 1942, authorized its use in connection with rubber and rubber
                                    products. To date this is the only exception authorized. Use may
                                    be authorized in connection with other very tight unallocated
                                    commodities, but only when specific instructions, as in the case
                                    of rubber, have been issued. In the latter case, instances of
                                    which will be very few, the Certifying Agencies should issue
                                    certificates with the greatest care and only for essential <pb
                                        n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0099"/>purposes. Such
                                    certificates will be considered in relation to the limitation
                                    orders affecting identical use in the United States.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The Certificate of Necessity will serve in lieu of a PD–1A
                                    form with regard to an allocated commodity. In this connection,
                                    however, the Certificate should contain full answers to the
                                    questions thereon, particularly as regards the end use of the
                                    commodity, existing inventories, and availability of
                                    substitutes. It is recognized that the Certifying Agencies in
                                    some of the other republics are still in process of organization
                                    and that all are not yet fully equipped to make the detailed
                                    investigations necessary to determine end use of allocated
                                    commodities for presentation on the Certificate form.
                                    Nevertheless, if such agencies, or any other agencies within the
                                    foreign governments, are to supervise the distribution of
                                    commodities after arrival they will eventually need to know such
                                    details. Thus the Missions are urged to encourage the agencies
                                    to persist in obtaining and recording such information, not only
                                    to comply with our requirements but also for their own future
                                    control purposes.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are certain vitally important questions regarding allocations
                            procedure which cannot be answered at this time. The first is whether
                            the unused portion of a quarterly allocation will carry forward into
                            subsequent quarters of the year. The problem is so involved that the
                            Requirements Committee has not yet been able to work out a solution. The
                            heavy industries of the United States are working against a strict
                            forward time-table to satisfy the demands of the armed forces of the
                            United Nations, and to attempt to telescope the unused portion of a
                            quarterly allocation into production schedules for following quarters
                            presents serious technical difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The second concerns the determination of what outstanding licenses shall
                            be charged against first quarter allocations. For example, in many cases
                            commodities licensed prior to January 1, 1942 are only now moving
                            forward, while at the same time there are outstanding thousands of first
                            quarter licenses for commodities that have moved forward only in part,
                            and some not at all. The administrative problem of determining the exact
                            status of the commodities that have been licensed, and checking them
                            against factory production schedules and export shipments, is an
                            extremely complicated one. However, the whole problem is receiving
                            urgent attention and it is hoped that solution will soon be arrived
                            at.</p>
                        <p>During the transitional period the Department appreciates that the
                            position of the Missions in this matter will be a difficult one.
                            However, the Missions should continue to cooperate as fully as possible
                            with the Certifying Agencies and encourage the careful issuance of the
                            Certificates, endeavoring to see that there is no cloaking, and that
                            established trade channels, and in particular American firms, receive a
                            proportionately fair share of the trade based on past performance.</p>
                        <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>The Department believes it inevitable that as the issuance of
                            Certificates progresses the responsibility of the Missions will
                            increase. It is understood that practically all of the Missions have
                            made informal arrangements with the Certifying Agencies to receive a
                            copy of each Certificate as issued. Needless to say, should the Mission
                            feel that any Certificate issued is not in the best interest of the
                            United States, the Certifying Agency should be approached tactfully with
                            a view to rectification. If the case is judged sufficiently serious to
                            warrant intervention, as a last resort, the Mission can effectively
                            nullify the Certificate by advising the Department in the premises.</p>
                        <p>There is evident a tendency in the other American republics to adopt
                            forms of economic control that are perhaps more comprehensive than the
                            situation warrants. The Department realizes, of course, the sovereign
                            right of the other American republics to institute such controls as they

                            connection, the Missions should lend their friendly and informal counsel
                            to prevent, if possible, the establishment of controls which appear
                            unnecessarily extensive or impractical. The Missions should be prompt in
                            reporting controls which adversely affect the treaty rights of the
                            United States and its citizens abroad.</p>

                            submitted many carefully thought out proposals but until now not only
                            has no concrete offer of aid been forthcoming from the United States but
                            it has been impossible even to obtain export clearance for raw materials
                            and equipment such as iron and steel, electrical iron and steel,
                            electrical machinery and agricultural implements which are indispensable

                            in conditions since the Inter-American Committee was created and makes
                            no reference whatever to the fact that the United States is now engaged

                            Embassy. Not only is that another instance of an attempt through
                            misleading publicity to make it more difficult for our Government to
                            refuse Chile’s requests but in my opinion the matter is one which should
                            have been taken up officially by the Chilean Government and not by the
                            head of a semi-governmental institution direct with an official of our
                            Government in Washington without the knowledge of either the Embassy or
                            the Department. At any rate publicity should not have been given

                            advantage should be taken of the opportunity to emphasize the true facts
                            of our position which Pedregal deliberately ignored and the text should
                            be given to United Press and Associated Press.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s interesting despatch of
                            April 27, 1942<note n="21" xml:id="d97fn21">Despatch No. 3124, not
                                printed.</note> concerning the procedure being established in Chile
                            with regard to the problem of allocated commodities and the issuance of
                            certificates of necessity, and is gratified to note the apparent
                            satisfactory degree of cooperation existing between the mission and the
                            control agencies of the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>With regard to the several questions raised by the Embassy, the
                            Department regrets that it can only answer in part. The fact is that the
                            production and control agencies in Washington are still in the throes of
                            evolving a procedure which, it is hoped, can be broad in principle but
                            yet flexible enough to take care of the infinite number of special
                            problems, many of which are of an emergency nature related to the war.
                            It can be stated at this time that broad procedural policies have
                            finally developed to the point where, within a short time, the
                            Department hopes to be able to summarize the procedure in an informative
                            instruction which will bring the missions up to date with the current
                            stage of development.</p>
                        <p>In specific reply to certain questions (paragraphs 3 and 4 on pages 3 and
                            4 of the despatch under reference) the Embassy is informed that plans
                            are now developing to separate the iron and steel requirements of
                            certain large mining industries producing for the war effort and it is
                            probable that future announcements of quarterly allocations of iron and
                            steel requirements will show the country’s estimated requirements apart
                            from the requirements of such industries. As for the breakdown of the
                            iron and steel allocations into types of material, the Embassy will
                            recognize that this was done in the second quarter allocations.</p>
                        <p>The Office of Export<note n="22" xml:id="d97fn22">Of the Board of
                                Economic Warfare.</note> is now following a general policy of
                            recognizing all applications covered by certificates of necessity
                            provided, of course, that (1) there is no evidence of cloaking, (2) the
                            amounts requested are reasonable and within the allocation, (3)
                            discrimination is not apparent, and (4) the use stated is clearly shown
                            and is permissible under limitation orders in the United States. If
                            administratively possible (the Office of Exports is handling 8,000
                            applications per day) it is hoped eventually to give specific reasons in
                            each case where a certificate of necessity is rejected.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy will also appreciate that the shipping situation has become
                            so difficult that it is seriously affecting the whole export problem,
                            including allocated commodities.<note n="23" xml:id="d97fn23">For
                                correspondence on the shipping problem, see <ref target="#pg_95">pp.
                                    95</ref> ff.</note> The congestion at ports and railway
                            terminals of goods awaiting ocean bottoms has reached the point where it
                            is necessary to reject export licenses for all but goods of the most
                            essential nature. While Chile is perhaps in a more favored position than
                            others of the republics as regards shipping, the problem is only
                            relatively less grave.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Ambassador’s telegram no. 756 dated
                            2 p.m., May 18, 1942, regarding a letter dated May 12, addressed by the
                            President of the Chilean Inter-American Development Committee to Mr.
                            Nelson Rockefeller as President of the Inter-American Development
                            Commission concerning difficulties in carrying out the program for the
                            economic development of Chile, which was published in the Chilean
                            press.</p>
                        <p>While the reply by Mr. Rockefeller, in his capacity as President of the
                            Commission referred to, will be made the subject of a separate
                            instruction, it may be pointed out that export statistics for the first
                            quarter of 1942 show that the United States has shipped to Chile goods
                            valued at $12,511,990 as compared with shipments during the first
                            quarter of 1941 totalling $10,666,747. As indicated by these statistics,
                            the United States has taken extraordinary measures to cooperate with
                            Chile by providing essential materials to prevent deterioration of the
                            Chilean national economy, despite the fact that this cooperation has
                            necessitated the diversion of important quantities of both labor and
                            materials which could otherwise have been utilized in the war effort of
                            the United States and its co-belligerents.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador is authorized to use this information in any way that he
                            may consider appropriate. These statistics are being made available to

                        <p>744. Your 1007, June 19. The problem you present has arisen in other
                            countries where vital mines are operating. Recognizing the viewpoint you
                            express, the Office of Exports has not required and is not requiring
                            Certificates of Necessity for export applications for materials going to
                            mines enjoying mine serial preference ratings.</p>
                        <p>The Projects Division of the Board of Economic Warfare is attempting to
                            obtain and break down the requirements of the strategic mining companies
                            as apart from other industrial requirements for other allocated
                            commodities. Such a separation cannot be accomplished before the fourth
                            quarter at which time it is contemplated that the quarterly allocations
                            announced will be net allocations available to the industries in Chile
                            distinct from the requirements of the mining companies.</p>
                        <p>For the first, second and third quarters, however, all shipments of
                            allocated commodities to the mining companies are charged off to the
                            allocations which were announced for those quarters. This charge off
                            will obviously not be satisfactory to the Junta but the production
                            situation here makes it necessary. In explanation to the Junta please
                                <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0105"/>inform it that the agencies
                            are cognizant of the problem involved and that it is hoped a solution
                            will be worked out for the fourth and subsequent quarters.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In continuation of my despatch No. 3909
                            of July 16, 1942,<note n="27" xml:id="d101fn27">Not printed.</note> I
                            have the honor to report that Dr. Rafael Torres, Legal Adviser of the
                            Chilean Ministry of Commerce, has informally suggested that it would be
                            advisable for the Embassy to discuss with the head of the Comisariato de
                            Subsistencias y Precios the possibility of forcing blacklisted firms to
                            disgorge their hoarded stocks. Dr. Torres remarked that there were
                            undoubtedly a number of undesirable firms, particularly in the iron and
                            steel trade, that had large accumulations of merchandise obtained by
                            devious methods from the United States, which were only available to
                            consumers at excessive prices. In his opinion, iron and steel products
                            and perhaps industrial chemicals should be declared articles of prime
                            necessity by the Comisariato, and excessive stocks of these goods should
                            be requisitioned with fair compensation to the owners, such stocks to be
                            pooled and redistributed. Dr. Torres was also of the opinion that the
                            Chilean Ministry of Commerce would not object to any arrangement that
                            might be worked out to force excessive merchandise holdings of
                            blacklisted firms into consumer channels. He added, and this is the most
                            interesting point of all, that he personally believed steps should be
                            taken at an early date to accomplish this objective as otherwise the
                            United States would be fully justified in withholding certain exports to
                            Chile on the ground that hoarded stocks in the country should be
                            utilized before further supplies are made available. It is understood
                            that Dr. Torres has also discussed this matter with Señor Guillermo del
                            Pedregal, Vice President of the Corporatión de Fomento, who expressed
                            himself as being in substantial agreement with the view of Dr.
                            Torres.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of this Embassy that the problem of hoarded stocks is
                            most acute in iron and steel, and in industrial chemicals. The Embassy
                            will take up this problem with the Comisariato de Subsistencias y
                            Precios.</p>

                            my despatch No. 2475 of January 26, 1942,<note n="28" xml:id="d102fn28"
                                >Neither printed.</note> which recommended that no new passenger
                            automobiles be imported into Chile from the United States in 1942, and
                            that truck imports should not exceed 500 units. Actual importations of
                            passenger automobiles in January-July 1942 amounted to 817 units, of
                            which 807 units were received from the United States and actual truck
                            importations to 1125 units, all of which came from the United States.
                            Consequently, in the first seven months of 1942 Chile has received
                            enough trucks to supply its essential requirements for a period of over
                            two years, and enough automobiles for several years essential
                            requirements. As supply of new passenger automobiles exceeds demand,
                            Chilean dealers are disposing of a part of surplus in the Argentine, as
                            reported in my airgram No. A–92 of August 25, 1942, and definite
                            information has now been received that some of these automobiles have
                            fallen into the hands of Proclaimed Nationals.</p>

                        <p>A–153. Your A–110, August 31. Investigation reveals that the bulk of the
                            substantial exports of automotives you mention went forward under old
                            export licenses granted the latter part of 1941 and which were not
                            revoked. As of July 1, further licensing of automotives to Chile has
                            been suspended subject to the Embassy’s advise on applications
                            presented. Furthermore, all outstanding licenses for automotives as yet
                            not exported will be revoked and subject to re-examination.</p>
                        <p>Referring to your airgram no. A–92 of August 25, 1942,<note n="29"

                            you inform the appropriate Chilean officials that the re-export to

                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0107"/>in Chile is considered by the Office of
                            Exports as an attempt to evade the conditions and responsibilities
                            incurred by the license under the general terms of the license granted
                            and that unless this movement ceases it may result in the offending
                            importing dealers being cut off from any further repair parts or
                            accessories. In discussing this matter, please point out that the stock
                            of automotives now in Chile must serve for an indefinite period and that
                            no more automotives can, or will, be licensed to Chile because there are
                            no more available. Please also inform the Department promptly as to the
                            names of the dealers who are selling automotives in Chile for export to
                            Argentina. For your strictly confidential information the Department
                            has, as a matter of policy, secured the suspension of all exports of
                            automotives from the United States to Argentina since July and the
                            action of the Chilean Government in facilitating the movement of
                            automotives to Argentina via Chile is embarrassing.</p>

                        <p>1579. That Chile will make a strong effort to obtain economic concessions
                            during President’s visit is clearly indicated by recent intense activity
                            of National Supply Board in preparing new estimates of country’s
                            requirements of many commodities, notably iron and steel and chemicals,
                            for Desiderio García of Fomento Corporation, member of Presidential
                            Party, who left for United States by air September 25. The
                            representations made in this connection will certainly exaggerate the
                            need and should not be accepted without confirmation by this Embassy.
                            Economically Chile is still in a favored situation and the essentially
                            selfish and unenlightened economic policy it has been following can
                            hardly be overlooked.</p>

                                xml:id="d105fn30">Not printed.</note> concerning the export of
                            American automobiles from Chile. The Department and the Office of
                            Exports consider that the dealers who exported automotives <pb n="94"
                                xml:id="pg_94" facs="0108"/>to Argentina violated the provisions of
                            the license which they received. The question as to whether they have
                            prejudiced themselves as consignees for further shipments of parts and
                            accessories depends on their future actions. The Department desires to
                            have this movement to Argentina stopped, and if any further exports of
                            automotives occur the Ambassador is requested to advise the Department
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the export of automotives to Peru and Bolivia the
                            Department and the Office of Exports wish to be advised of the nature
                            and circumstances of each proposed shipment. Specifically, the Office of
                            Exports has no objection to the shipments proposed to Bolivia in your
                            despatch under reference, but is the Embassy certain that the consignees
                            are acceptable; please cable advice on this latter point. However, the
                            Department believes it would be helpful to call to the attention of
                            Chilean dealers that there is no possibility of replacing from the
                            United States such units as they may export to Peru and Bolivia.</p>

                                Michels.</note> called to see me this morning at his request in
                            order that Señor Desiderio García, representative of the Fomento
                            Corporation of Chile, could say goodby to me before he left for
                            Santiago.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Señor García stated that he had come to the United States some two months
                            ago, arriving some two weeks before the anticipated arrival of President
                            Ríos, in order that he might serve as a member of the President’s
                            advisory committee on economic and financial problems, which the
                            President had hoped to discuss with the United States Government, He
                            said that since that time he had busied himself with obtaining
                            machinery, both new and second-hand, which the Fomento Corporation
                            desired for Chile, and he emphasized the difficulties he had had in this
                            regard owing to the stringent export control on machinery of this
                            character.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that of course Chile, like all of the American Republics,
                            including the United States, was under difficulties at the present
                            moment in obtaining imports for civilian needs, and that I believed
                            these difficulties were nothing compared to the economic difficulties
                            which <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0109"/>would afflict the American
                            republics in the period immediately after the end of the war. I said
                            that at the present time Chile, except for her difficulty in getting
                            imports was in an admirable economic situation owing to the fact that
                            every scrap of metal which she could produce and her nitrates were being
                            sold to the United States. I said it was obvious that this type of
                            market would not exist in the post-war period and that it was for that
                            reason that I had been much impressed by what the President of
                                Ecuador<note n="32" xml:id="d106fn32">Carlos Arroyo del Río.</note>
                            had said to me last night upon his arrival in Washington on a visit
                            which we most cordially welcome, namely, that he believed that the
                            intimate and understanding economic cooperation of the American
                            Republics after the war was even more to their interest and advantage
                            than their economic cooperation during the war, important as that might
                            be. I said that of course the Republics which were now joined together
                            in the war effort had established that kind of indispensable basis for
                            future cooperation in the post-war period which would prove invaluable
                            to all of them. I said that I regretted, of course, more deeply than
                            Señor García could appreciate that the Government of Chile was not
                            taking part in this great inter-American cooperative effort, since her
                            participation would be greatly valued and would certainly be, from every
                            standpoint, to the interests of the people of Chile.</p>
                        <p>Señor García immediately asked if I had read the statements published
                            this morning which had been made yesterday by the President of Chile,
                            and I replied that I had. Señor García then expressed the hope that the
                            time would be short before Chile and the other American Republics joined

                        <p>65. Grace Line representatives, Santiago, are advising Chilean shippers
                            that their weekly service is temporarily interrupted and that they
                            expect to offer space by a freight vessel from Valparaiso sometime
                            towards the end of January, by a second freighter in the middle of
                            February and by a passenger ship also a freighter around <pb n="96"
                                xml:id="pg_96" facs="0110"/>the end of February. The present period
                            is the height of the season for shipments to New York of the Chilean
                            fresh fruit. Other shippers of produce et cetera are normally served
                            weekly by Grace Line from Valparaiso alternating with passenger and
                            freight vessels. It is presumed that the usual service will be resumed
                            after March 1 although this is not confirmed. The most important part of
                            the fruit shipments are the grapes which only begin to move at the
                            beginning of March when presumably schedules will be resumed.</p>

                        <p>81. Your 65, January 12, 9 p.m. It is the Department’s understanding that
                            the facts concerning the Grace Line Service contained in the telegram
                            under reference are substantially correct. This interruption to the
                            service has been brought about chiefly because of the necessity for
                            removing vessels from service temporarily for the purpose of installing
                            arms and degaussing equipment. It is understood that some Maritime
                            Commission vessels have been diverted to this trade, principally to load
                            copper. Unless further withdrawals of tonnage become necessary, it is
                            expected that Grace Line Service should be back on a regular basis by
                            March 1. Within the last few days, however, the Grace Line vessel <hi

                        <p>250. The Department has been notified by the War Shipping Administration
                            that war needs have made necessary the withdrawal of <pb n="97"
                                xml:id="pg_97" facs="0111"/>all United States passenger vessels
                            serving South America from New York. It will, of course, be impossible
                            to replace those withdrawn previously. The Department is aware of the
                            hardships which this step will cause to the country to which you are
                            accredited but it is confident that these will be willingly accepted in
                            view of the tremendous importance of these vessels in the war effort.
                            The War Shipping Administration and the Department both realize the
                            desirability of reestablishing passenger service and will seek to do so
                            as soon as the military situation permits. Please inform seaport
                            consulates.</p>

                        <p>463. We are advised that first grade motor gasoline stocks in Chile will
                            be exhausted April 1 and total motor gasoline stock April 15. Latin
                            American supply committee New York has postponed earliest tanker loading
                            Talara until April 1 to arrive Chile April 10 thus leaving no margin of
                            safety. Unless loading date advanced the Chilean Government pool
                            committee will recommend to Government that it introduce rationing
                            effective March 26 and stop all movement of private automobiles in an
                            effort to bridge over supplies. The Government presently engaged in
                            establishing definite rationing scheme which it is judged cannot become
                            effective until May 1. Please inform whether there is any possible way
                            to get a tanker for earlier loading than April 1 and in the event this
                            is impossible shall I reenforce the recommendation of the Chilean pool
                            committee to the Government.</p>

                                    the consumption of gasoline. Studies made and present rationing
                                    experience shows clearly that a reduction of 33% in consumption
                                    would mean enormous disturbances and make it impossible to
                                    maintain the movement of domestic commerce. On the other hand,
                                    it is indispensable to maintain an emergency stock in tanks
                                    which are emptied now soon after the small shipments are
                                    received, which creates, besides, the grave problem of assuring

                                    commercial vehicles. Should such a guaranty be obtained, efforts

                        <p>727. Public ill feeling in Chile is growing due to restrictions on
                            gasoline partially at least due to lack of adequate publicity that
                            similar or more drastic rationing is taking place in 17 Eastern States
                            and 2 Northwestern States. An immediate effective press release showing
                            to the South American countries but especially Chile that the petroleum
                                <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0114"/>restrictions they are
                            suffering are only equal to those imposed on people in the United States
                            is urgently desirable: that its policy of equal treatment of South
                            American countries as regards petroleum supplies represents a great
                            sacrifice to the American people and to the war effort.</p>
                        <p>Suggest that the Petroleum Coordinator or the Deputy give an interview
                            along these lines, and that for the next 3 or 4 weeks arrangements can
                            be made for follow up stories to be cabled the United Press and
                            Associated Press. The air mail edition of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>
                            and newsreel shots of the effect of gasoline rationing in the United
                            States are also useful means of publicity.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit for the
                            Department’s information statistics prepared at the request of the
                            Embassy by the local office <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0115"/>of
                            Grace and Company showing the small percentage (8 per cent in March) of
                            Chilean exports to the United States carried by vessels of the Chilean
                            merchant marine.</p>
                        <p>Grace and Company is now preparing similar statistics for April. During
                            that month it is believed that only about 5 per cent of Chilean exports
                            to the United States were carried by Chilean vessels.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted that there are only three vessels belonging to the
                            Chilean Line (Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores or C.S.A.V.) but they
                            are also operating six small Danish vessels taken over last year. In the
                            opinion of Grace and Company, the practical maximum annual shipments of
                            cargo by these vessels to the United States would not exceed 120,000
                            tons.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy requested Grace and Company to make this statistical study
                            since one argument against rupture of relations with the Axis which
                            finds wide credence in Chile is that Chilean exports to the United
                            States would thereafter be subject to attack by Axis vessels, it being
                            the general belief that a large percentage of such exports is carried by
                            Chilean vessels.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this study articles have now been published in the Chilean
                            press (see my Despatch No. 3477 of May 30<note n="43" xml:id="d117fn43"
                                >Not printed; this despatch was dated June 1.</note>) showing that
                            the so-called protection against submarine attack against Chile’s
                            exports extends only to the 5 to 8 per cent of those exports which are
                            carried by the Chilean line.</p>

                        <p>865. In view of the request for a repeat, it is thought that my 852, May
                            30, 11 a.m.<note n="44" xml:id="d118fn44">Not printed.</note> was not
                            clear to the Department and the following is clarification of that
                            message.</p>
                        <p>Chilean officials were orally informed in accordance with the
                            Department’s 556, May 20, 6 p.m.<note n="44" xml:id="d118fn46">Not

                            in the Pacific. The Minister of Commerce<note n="45" xml:id="d118fn45"
                                >Pedro Alvarez Suárez.</note> now desires that that statement be
                            submitted in writing and that no objection be raised to the publication
                            of such communication by the Chilean Government. It is his thought that
                            the publication of a formal statement <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
                                facs="0116"/>by the Embassy will serve to reconcile the Chilean
                            public to the necessity of gasoline restrictions and stop the campaign

                            and your 865, June 1, 3 p.m. While the facts regarding the distribution
                            of petroleum products from Talara are as stated in the Department’s 556,
                            May 20, 6 p.m.,<note n="46" xml:id="d119fn47">Not printed.</note> the
                            Department questions the desirability of the publication in Chile of a
                            statement emanating from the American Embassy on this subject. As you
                            are no doubt aware, both the allocation among the American republics of
                            available petroleum products and the means for transporting these
                            products are currently being handled through cooperative arrangements in
                            which all of the American republics participate. The needs of the war
                            effort have resulted in the removal of large numbers of tankers under
                            the control of the United Nations from their ordinary routes. However,
                            the remaining resources, particularly of transportation, are being
                            allocated among the different countries in accordance with their
                            civilian needs. There is no ground whatever for the thought that Chile
                            is being in any way discriminated against. Possibly the Chilean
                            Representative on the oil supply pool Committee in Santiago might issue
                            an authoritative statement which would serve the purposes that you have
                            in mind.</p>

                            has been blacklisted wherever its branches are to be found. This is also
                            the firm which initiated negotiations with the United States Embassy in
                            Santiago looking toward its removal from the Proclaimed List, and which
                            discontinued these negotiations which lasted over a period of about two
                            months for reasons unknown to the United States Embassy.</p>
                        <p>On May 22, 1942, an order was issued by the Comité Nacional de
                            Distribución de Petróleo to deliver 150 liters of Diesel Oil monthly to
                            Air France, a firm controlled from German-occupied territory, although
                            this line is not operating at the present time nor is there any
                            likelihood of its operating in the near future.</p>

                            hesitate to admit to a member of the staff of the United States Embassy
                            that he was a member of one of the blocks (Block No. 4) of the Nazi
                            party in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>Order No. 62, dated May 26, 1942, from the Dirección de Abastecimiento de
                            Petróleo, Comisión Racionadora de Gasolina, directed Copec to deliver
                            500 liters of gasoline monthly to Siemens-Schuckert, a concern which is
                            known to have engaged in anti-neutral and National-Socialist activity in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government views such orders with deep concern,
                            especially when they involve essential materials such as petroleum, an
                            adequate supply of which for Chile represents a problem and sacrifice of
                            United States and British interests. It is hoped that the Chilean
                            Government will perceive the desirability to make the Proclaimed List
                            Policy completely effective, as the continuance of compulsion to deliver
                            such essential raw materials to local firms on the Proclaimed List
                            without prior consultative cooperation will seriously undermine one of
                            the important elements of hemisphere defense. It is believed that if
                            local control is not instituted in Chile over Axis and other undesirable
                            interests, at least affirmative action which amounts to support of
                            Proclaimed List firms should be avoided.</p>

                        <p>956. From the outset the Chilean Government has shown unwillingness to
                            face the facts regarding the petroleum situation. Instead of accepting
                            the evident necessity for a sharp reduction in normal consumption and
                            making an honest effort to meet our ideas, it has tried, through
                            bargaining tactics, to get just as much as possible although membership
                            in the Latin American pool implies cooperation in the common interest.
                            Furthermore, the Government has done nothing to correct the false
                            impression in the mind of the public resulting from misleading and
                            inaccurate press stories that there is no shortage even of tankers
                            sufficient to justify the present curtailment of supplies and
                            consequently that the United States is merely exerting pressure on
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>Equal reduction of petroleum consumption may mean very unequal sacrifice
                            in the different countries and there is no doubt that in Chile the
                            curtailment to two-thirds of 1941 consumption means severe hardship.
                            Thus, Chile has valid arguments available but by its tactics it is not
                            only prejudicing its own case but allowing an unnecessary growth
                            antagonism against the United States. This situation is so unfortunate
                            for both countries that I feel strongly it should be cleared up in order
                            that further discussion of the petroleum problem may be on a practical
                            instead of a bargaining basis. I recommend the Department to instruct me
                            by cable to take up the matter with the Chilean Government in line with
                            the foregoing.</p>

                            effort by furnishing copper, nitrates, et cetera is appreciated and is
                            recognized by exempting <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0119"/>from
                            the rationed category and furnishing in full the oil supplies which are
                            necessary for the production of those war essential materials. Emphasis
                            should be placed upon the fact that approximately 85 percent of Chile’s
                            total oil requirements is for services classified as war essential,
                            exclusive of oil demands for bunkering allied navies which does not
                            contribute directly to the national economy of Chile. This means in
                            effect that a 50 percent reduction in Chile’s rationable civilian
                            consumption corresponds to only 7½ percent of her total national demand
                            based upon 1941. This is a very moderate burden for Chile to bear in
                            comparison with the other oil importing republics. In these
                            circumstances this Government does not view with favor any proposal to
                            divert any available tanker tonnage from less fortunate neighboring
                            republics for the purpose of still further improving Chile’s relative
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>It should also be pointed out that during the first 5 months of 1942
                            Chile’s gasoline consumption has been 10 percent higher than during the
                            same period of 1941.</p>

                        <p>1083. The announcement of further reduction in supplies of petroleum
                            products to Chile has fallen like a bombshell on the Government, the
                            President canceling appointments for a special Cabinet meeting to
                            consider the situation and will probably have an equally bad effect on
                            public opinion here for the well-organized Axis propaganda will
                            doubtless redouble its not unsuccessful efforts in connection with the
                            first reduction of petroleum supplies.</p>
                        <p>I hope the Department will authorize me to say that every effort will be
                            made to prevent interruption of vital services mainly truck and bus
                            transportation. Secondly, it is important that the press associations
                            carry an interesting and convincing statement from someone of importance
                            within the Government—I suggest Mr. Welles—pointing out dramatically
                            that the present scarcity is the result of war needs in this important
                            year and pointing out that other countries dependent on tanker-borne
                            supplies such as Brazil, Uruguay, et cetera, are receiving the same
                            treatment and that even this reduced treatment is only possible at a
                            sacrifice of the military needs of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>One difficulty here is that it is well-known throughout Chile that Peru,
                            Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela are undergoing no rationing and it is
                            the thorough belief here that rationing even in the Eastern States is on
                            a much more generous per capita scale than in Chile.</p>
                        <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0120"/>
                        <p>It is particularly unfortunate that this reduction occurred at this
                            precise moment and we must react vigorously with the best publicity
                            available.</p>

                            reply to the Embassy’s note of July 6, 1942, which was based on the
                            Department’s circular telegram, dated June 30 [<hi rend="italic"

                            for a further reduction in petroleum deliveries. In the latter
                            memorandum reference is made to the Ministry’s previous communications
                            regarding the petroleum problem and to the fact that no communication
                            has been received from the Embassy in reply setting forth the opinion of
                            the competent American authorities with regard to Chile’s estimates of
                            its indispensable needs. In the present instance a specific request is
                            made that the additional information now furnished be transmitted to the
                            Government of the United States in order that consideration may be given
                            to the possibility of authorizing the delivery of 12,000,000 liters of
                            gasoline per month, which is considered the quantity indispensable to
                            the Chilean economy. In this connection reference is made to the
                            Embassy’s despatches No. 3480 of June 1, 1942, No. 3549 of June 9, 1942,
                            and No. 3574 of June 11, 1942,<note n="58" xml:id="d127fn58">None
                                printed.</note> with which were transmitted the three communications
                            received from the Chilean Government on the subject of the country’s
                            petroleum requirements, together with the Embassy’s comments.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the additional data now furnished are by no means of a
                            convincing character and do little to support Chile’s claim that it must
                            receive larger supplies of petroleum products if essential needs are to
                            be taken care of. The figure of 12,000,000 liters of gasoline per <pb
                                n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0122"/>month is entirely arbitrary and
                            is evidently put forward as a trading proposition. Particularly in the
                            matter of private cars there is still little evidence that the rationing
                            of gasoline has had pronounced effects on the number in circulation and,
                            in the case of other petroleum products, it is admitted that little has
                            been done toward reducing normal consumption. The Embassy knew that the
                            Ministry of Commerce, which is handling the petroleum problem, was
                            preparing its case and hoped that instead of repeating the same general
                            arguments which had prevously been put forward specific facts and
                            figures would be presented, showing in detail the quantities of the
                            various petroleum products required for essential uses and the
                            quantities now being supplied under the reduced delivery schedule.</p>
                        <p>A further attempt will be made to obtain data of this character which
                            will be transmitted promptly with the Embassy’s comments. Meanwhile,
                            unless and until the Chilean Government demonstrates that it has done
                            everything possible to eliminate all waste and unessential consumption
                            of petroleum products it does not seem desirable that our Government
                            should agree to increase the schedule of deliveries now in effect. This
                            statement is made despite the fact that in the Embassy’s opinion that
                            schedule does place Chile in an extremely difficult position.</p>

                        <p>A–91. In accordance with his latest intimation from the Department that
                            40% of the 1941 petroleum consumption might be the total available for
                            normal internal consumption in Chile, a study was prepared by Mr.
                                Clover<note n="59" xml:id="d128fn59">Philip Clover, Petroleum
                                Attaché at Buenos Aires, whose jurisdiction included Chile.</note>
                            from all available data to show the effect upon Chile’s internal
                            economy. It is the Embassy’s recommendation that the 40% basis be
                            modified to the extent of an additional 153,000 barrels every 6 months,
                            say 2 cargoes. Total rationed consumption in any 6 months’ period would
                            thus be scheduled as 488,000 barrels.</p>
                        <p>It is expected this quantity would permit the functioning of essential
                            public services, motor truck and bus transport at an existence level,
                            and such taxis and essential private cars as may be necessary, but would
                            eliminate pleasure driving. The Embassy considers that further <pb
                                n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0123"/>reductions are not feasible,
                            except on the basis that lack of tankers precludes the possibility of
                            giving consideration to the effect upon Chile of any further reduction
                            in petroleum supplies.</p>
                        <p>This basis and the inevitability of it have been explained to the Chilean
                            authorities. As soon as the Department telegraphs what quantity may be
                            expected it is anticipated that Chile will issue rationing orders in
                            conformity with the visible supplies.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy once more repeated to the authorities that any chartering of
                            tankers by Chile would not help their situation unless they secured a
                            fleet capable of bringing in more than the total quantity planned for
                            Chile by the Pool. Lesser capacity would help the Pool, not Chile.</p>
                        <p>For over-all political reasons the Embassy very strongly recommends that
                            the Department accept by telegram this estimate as the minimum to be
                            supplied for Chile’s normal requirements. The comparatively small extra
                            quantity is considered to be a negligible price to pay for a gesture
                            considered by the Chilean authorities to be a realistic cooperation with
                            their very pressing difficulties. At this stage of our political
                            negotiations only overwhelming necessity could justify forcing normal
                            local petroleum consumption below what is considered by the governmental
                            authorities and the Embassy to be the lowest subsistence level.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s recommendation is based upon the following study:</p>
                        <p>Recommended petroleum allotment for a 6 months’ period, on basis of
                            cutting supplies to lowest figure short of a basic disruption of Chile’s
                            internal economy.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows statistical table.]</p>
                        <p>The normal consumption for non war-essential use in 1941 (July–December)
                            was 23.7% of Chile’s total consumption. In common with the other
                            petroleum importing South American Republics, it is understood that
                            Chile will be asked to cut her consumption to 40% of the 1941
                            figure.</p>
                        <p>A basic study of the effects of such a cut indicates that a minimum of
                            13.8% of the 1941 consumption (instead of the normal 23.7%) is required
                            for the functioning of the internal economy, even on a very reduced
                            basis. This increase over the 40% amounts to 153,000 barrels, or 2 extra
                            tankers in 6 months.</p>
                        <p>It is considered that the above appraisal of the minimum quantities for
                            Chile is applicable to any 6 months’ period, and not just for the last 6
                            months of 1942, because seasonal variations have been eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Supporting data covering each product will be detailed in Mr. Clover’s
                            report to the Petroleum Adviser.</p>

                        <p>1465. To Secretary and Under Secretary. Department’s circular telegram,
                            September 9, 9 p.m. In my airgram 91, August 25, 5:50 p.m., I reported
                            with all possible emphasis that only overwhelming necessity could
                            justify reduction petroleum deliveries to Chile at this time to such an
                            extent as absolutely to disrupt the country’s economy. I recommend that
                            deliveries for other than war essential uses be at the rate of 60% of
                            1941 consumption. Your own petroleum expert, Mr. Clover, after a very
                            careful study on the ground, concluded that a reduction below 60% would
                            have disastrous effects on country’s economy. We are firmly convinced
                            that to reduce to 40% would have major economic consequences that would
                            most gravely compromise any progress we are making with difficult
                            political negotiations and give our enemies ammunition that would be
                            used with deadly effect against us.</p>
                        <p>With all possible emphasis, therefore, I urge that no change be made in
                            present delivery schedule, at least until after the President’s visit,
                            and that instead of advising Chilean Government that a further reduction
                            has been made I merely inform them that the increase asked is impossible
                            and warn that further reductions may be necessary. <pb n="111"
                                xml:id="pg_111" facs="0125"/>Even this will be a very hard blow
                            since consumption is still far above the 50% level and stocks,
                            particularly motor gasoline and kerosene, are small. I shall take no
                            action until you have reconsidered the matter and I receive further
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>Just at this critical juncture with lines closely drawn here, we are
                            already creating the impression of bringing pressure in the case of
                            nitrate and copper and it certainly seems unwise to me knowingly to
                            strike a disastrous blow at Chile’s economy that may easily turn public
                            opinion bitterly against us in the midst of difficult negotiations that
                            are making progress. I am so positive that I am correct that I cannot
                            assume the responsibility without again making clear to the Department
                            the dangerous political reactions that would follow the disruption of
                            Chilean economy.</p>

                        <p>1039. Department is impressed with the facts and arguments summarized in
                            Embassy’s A–91 of August 25 which analyze Chile’s requirements for oil
                            and is making unremitting efforts to maintain oil supplies to Chile, as
                            to the other American republics, at a level which will avoid basic
                            disruption of internal economy. The fact is that demands on tanker
                            transportation for direct war services leave this Department as well as
                            other agencies of this Government which are concerned in maintaining
                            civilian supplies with a limited and possibly even a further decreasing
                            total tonnage which can be divided among the republics but which cannot
                            be increased. You should make clear to the Government of Chile that it
                            is in no sense a lack of “consideration to the effect upon Chile” on the
                            part of this Government, but the nonexistence of sufficient tankers that
                            compels Chile along with the other oil importing republics to
                            accommodate consumption to the possibilities of supply.</p>
                        <p>While it regrets the obvious necessity for this conclusion the Department
                            feels that the only realistic viewpoint is the one that recognizes the
                            lack of tankers as a physical fact and it is the opinion of the
                            Department that nothing can be gained by representing to Chile that any
                            improvement in the oil supply situation can be expected in the near
                            future.</p>

                        <p>1477. For Under Secretary. I am sending this to you because of its vital
                            effect on present political negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Department’s circular September 9, 9 p.m. and number 1039, September 11,
                            9 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Chilean Government has been informed of the further reduction in
                            petroleum supplies for other than war essential uses of 40% 1941
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>Although your telegrams indicate that this reduction is only effective
                            now the Chilean Pool Committee has information that it is retroactive
                            from August 1. If the latter is correct Chile will soon find herself
                            completely without petroleum and while I cannot defend her
                            shortsightedness in not having adjusted consumption to our delivery
                            schedule such a situation simply cannot be permitted to arise.</p>
                        <p>The following figures, expressed in thousands of liters, make this danger
                            clear: Pool Committee New York will calculate that on 40% basis Chile is
                            entitled deliveries at rate of only 6375 gasoline and 563 kerosene per
                            month as from August 1st and that in view of supplies already received
                            since that date no further deliveries should be made for a considerable
                            period. September rationing is still on basis of 9700 gasoline and 1180
                            kerosene and August consumption was considerably higher which means that
                            in 2 months Chile will have used up nearly twice as much as will be
                            replaced and therefore that her approximate stocks of 22600 gasoline and
                            2300 kerosene on September 1st will be rapidly exhausted. Specific data
                            are not available for black products but a similar situation is known to
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>If transportation facilities, light, power should all be cut off, and
                            this will result if replacements of petroleum supplies to Chile should
                            be placed on the 40% basis as from August 1, the reaction on public
                            opinion here would be tremendous and largely counteract all we have
                            recently gained on the main issue of breaking relations. I cannot urge
                            too strongly therefore that the effective date of the new reduction be
                            postponed until October 1st when a decree prohibiting the use of private
                            cars except when specially authorized goes into force or at least that
                            the reduction not be made effective until September 12th, the date on
                            which the Chilean Government was first given notice. Please telegraph
                            instructions on this point urgently.</p>

                                    increase), et cetera. If we average all shipments to Chile,
                                    deliveries are actually at a rate of 101% of 1941, a somewhat
                                    irrelevant figure.</item>

                                    products. Nevertheless, its consumption of aviation gasoline was
                                    up 48.4% during the first seven months of this year, kerosene up
                                    30.6%, and motor gasoline up 1.9%.</item>

                                <item>The Embassy has been repeatedly warned that consumption must
                                    be cut. On June 29 the Department advised Ambassador Bowers to
                                    inform Chile that the cut would be to “less than 50%”. This
                                    reduction was to be effective August 1, but in reality took
                                    effect <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0128"/>nearer September
                                    1, as products scheduled or en route were not affected. Mr.
                                    Welles at meetings of the Inter-American Economic and Financial
                                    Advisory Committee repeatedly discussed the situation, advising
                                    of a cut of not more than 40% at the August 6 meeting. Thus
                                    there seems to be no basis for the Ambassador’s statement that
                                    Chile heard of the reduction only on September 12.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since the supply of tankers for American republics’ needs is fixed (in
                            fact, declining due to sinkings), we can provide more petroleum to Chile
                            only by taking it away from one of the other republics. Brazil and
                            Uruguay have already been put on a 40% basis, and they are the only
                            countries from which tankers could be taken. Any increase in deliveries
                            to the three countries could be done only by removing tankers from other
                            areas—that is, from direct war uses in Australia, England, et cetera.
                            This I believe the Department would hesitate to request.</p>
                        <p>I agree with Mr. Thornburg that there is no permanent solution to this
                            problem short of an amelioration in the war situation and the
                            construction of additional tankers. Nevertheless, as it is of the
                            greatest political expediency, the effective date of this cut can
                            probably be made September 15 or October 1. I do not see how it can be
                            postponed any further.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of Mr. Thornburg, EO<note n="68a" xml:id="d133fn68a">Board

                            Petroleum Pool to make the effective date September 15 or possibly

                                >Telegrams No. 1530 and No. 1122 not printed.</note> Arrangements
                            have been made to reschedule oil supplies to Chile on the basis that the
                            reduction from 66 percent to 40 percent will not become effective until
                            October 1. According to current reports from pool committee which are
                            confirmed by your 1477 Chile will on this basis start October with
                            sufficient gasoline stocks to meet her civilian requirements on a 40
                            percent basis for two months which is a higher reserve inventory than
                            the pool even attempts to maintain elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>For obvious reasons it is not desirable to give names, positions and
                            services of any tankers, and all Government agencies are making efforts
                                <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0129"/>to avoid broadcasting such
                            information, but local committee will have sufficient information
                            currently to enable Chilean authorities to plan regulatory measures.</p>
                        <p>You should tell the Chilean authorities that the announcement of the 40
                            percent supply program was not intended to be regarded as a decision on
                            the part of this Government but instead as the disclosure by this
                            Government of a factual situation which the Chilean Government would do
                            well to prepare to meet. The fact that Chile disregarded this advice two
                            months ago has now required that this Government deprive war important
                            services of oil and send tankers to Chile instead. This course cannot be
                            continued. On the other hand you should assure the Chilean Government
                            that whenever improved situation or special circumstances make it
                            possible additional supplies will be put in to enable the reserve
                            inventory to be built up. Department wishes you to know that despite
                            statements that have been made it has as yet seen no reason for
                            believing that the burden of reduced oil supplies in Chile is as serious
                            as in a number of other republics which do not have either substitute
                            fuels or war industries which receive full supply.</p>

                        <p>1643. Chilean Government has just chartered Argentine tanker <hi
                                rend="italic">Juncal</hi> believed to be en route to the United
                            States with vegetable oil for Commodity Credit Corporation, for single
                            trip from West Coast United States to Chile with 10 million liters
                            gasoline. This gasoline is ostensibly to increase reserves of Ministry
                            for Defense but when asked whether it would be counted as delivery by
                            pool answer was evasive and there will be nothing to prevent its use for
                            civilian consumption.</p>
                        <p>Embassy is also informed that Ministry of Defense has contracted to buy
                            outside of the pool 10,000 barrels of aviation gasoline in steel drums
                            to be delivered within 90 days probably at San Pedro.</p>
                        <p>Both transactions will result in considerably higher cost than pool
                            deliveries and Embassy considers them extremely questionable. Local
                            Standard subsidiary has informed headquarters and recommended that the
                            Department investigate immediately.</p>

                        <p>1235. Embassy’s 1643, October 6. Any cargo delivered to Chile will be
                            counted as a pool delivery.</p>
                        <p>It seems unlikely that the Ministry of Defense will be able to purchase
                            10,000 barrels of aviation gasoline in steel drums while there is said
                            to be more than 13 months supply in Chile and while bulk supplies are
                            available to the Government from present suppliers. It seems unlikely
                            that export licenses will be issued for 10,000 steel drums. This is for
                            your personal information.</p>

                        <p>1840. A very acute situation is developing as a result of curtailment of
                            petroleum supplies and information from various friendly and reliable
                            sources indicates that extremely serious political and social
                            disturbances may develop. Obviously our enemies are effectively
                            exploiting the general discontent and have been successful in creating
                            the belief on the part of large numbers that the United States is trying
                            to force Chile’s hand by withholding petroleum supplies.</p>
                        <p>The trade associations and labor unions, whose members are dependent on
                            the continued operation of motor vehicles and motor driven equipment,
                            have united in an appeal to President Ríos for immediate and effective
                            action and have tentatively proposed as a solution that Chile utilize
                            its two small navy tankers exclusively to supply class B rationed
                            consumption, leaving class A to be supplied by the pool. They claim that
                            since Chile would then herself be responsible for transporting supplies
                            for class B consumption it would effectively silence the charge of
                            pressure by the United States. They firmly believe that public opinion
                            will force the navy to utilize their tankers, which today are operating
                            far under capacity, with much greater efficiency once it is generally
                            known they alone are responsible for supplying class B needs. Including
                            in category B the consumption of the Chilean navy and armed forces and
                            the national air line as well as Panagra,<note n="70" xml:id="d137fn70"
                                >Pan American-Grace Airways.</note> which are supplied today under
                            A, we estimate that if the Chilean navy tankers operate with 100%
                            efficiency they could supply for class B 50% of 1941 consumption instead
                            of 40%.</p>
                        <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>There might be a saving in the tanker tonnage now provided by the pool
                            and in any event no loss since the navy tankers are now transporting
                            less than the quantities allotted to class B.</p>
                        <p>Although this proposal is not in conformity with pool principles and if
                            the plan broke down Chile would of course expect the United States to
                            come to its aid, the Embassy has been asked by representatives of the
                            group to submit it and since political and social disturbances would
                            harmfully effect our war effort, I ask that it be given very careful
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>It would of course have to be definitely agreed by Chile that if the plan
                            were accepted no attempt would be made to obtain additional tankers
                            outside of the pool.</p>

                            the Chilean Embassy called at my office to discuss the current oil
                            supply situation in Chile. Apparently it was their intention to propose
                            the use of the two Chilean Navy tankers in somewhat the same way that
                            Ambassador Bowers outlined in his cable number 1840 of October 30. The
                            general idea seemed to be that the two Navy tankers would be used to
                            supply a limited category of requirements which they designate as class
                            B, including supplies for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Air Lines.
                            According to their proposals these Navy tankers and the requirements
                            indicated as falling within class B would be removed from the pool,
                            which would otherwise operate as at present.</p>
                        <p>I explained to them that the current requirements for the Army, Navy and
                            Air Force, as well as all Air Lines, were already in our “essential”
                            category and, therefore, are fully supplied on the unrationed basis.
                            Consequently, there is no point in the suggestion that the Navy tankers
                            be assigned to this particular service outside the pool. I told them
                            further that Mr. Welles and Mr. Bonsal were giving very close and minute
                            attention to the present oil supply problem in Chile, and that I have,
                            only today, been instructed to take immediate steps to deal with that
                            situation in some effective way. I added that one such step that had
                            been decided upon is to send Mr. Nuland, Executive Secretary of the
                            Foreign Petroleum Policy Committee to Santiago at once to make
                            particular examination of the oil requirements <pb n="118"
                                xml:id="pg_118" facs="0132"/>which should be classified as
                            “essential”, and, therefore, removed from the rationed category.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to point out to them that according to our information
                            from Mr. Bowers, the two Chilean Navy tankers are at present working
                            “far below capacity”. I said that our Ambassador obviously could not be
                            expected to know this except by report and that, consequently, he might
                            be in error, but that if it proved to be true, it must be looked upon as
                            a shocking disregard of our pool principles. Mr. Ynnaes [<hi
                                rend="italic">Illanes</hi>] and Colonel Marin both appeared
                            astonished at this report and promised to look into it. They seemed
                            completely satisfied with the present plan of having Mr. Nuland visit
                            Santiago and agreed that the principles which I described, and which
                            they discussed in some detail to make sure they understood, were
                            sound.</p>
                        <p>For the record, these principles were as follows: <list>

                                    committees which have already been established for this

                                    The rationed category, however, will remain at forty percent or

                        <p>1318. Your 1840, October 30, 3 p.m. The Department shares your concern at
                            the situation developing in Chile with regard to the curtailment of
                            petroleum supplies. The Department realizes the extent to which our
                            enemies will continue to exploit the difficulties resulting from the
                            reduction in normal supplies. The Department feels it extremely
                            important to dispel by all possible means the impression which our
                            enemies are endeavoring to create that Chile is being discriminated
                            against.</p>
                        <p>It has consequently been decided that, within the next few days, Mr. L.

                            with you and with Chilean officials all phases of Chile’s petroleum
                            problems, including those described by you in your telegram under

                            Nuland’s trip and to assure them of this Government’s desire to
                            cooperate fully in the solution of Chile’s problems within the limits of
                            the supply situation which confronts the American republics as a whole.

                        <p>2004. For Thornburg from Nuland. Reference your memorandum of
                            conversation dated November 2 with Colonel Marin and Marionynnaes [<hi
                                rend="italic">Mario Illanes</hi>]. Preliminary discussions held
                            today indicate Chile’s desire to receive supplies of fuel oil and diesel
                            oil approximately equal to their 1941 consumption. Their estimate of
                            gasoline consumption for November and December indicates a cut of
                            approximately 6% from a similar period in 1941. The foregoing refers to
                            category B only as there is no question about A essentials.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that in their mind is the use of their tankers and any
                            other tankers which they may secure including a possible one from Sweden
                            and a possible one from Argentina which would supply their B essentials
                            at practically 100% of their 1941 consumption. It was pointed out to
                            them that if they desired to leave the pool then they would also have to
                            supply 40% of their A essentials which are now supplied with pool
                            tonnage and they correctly stated that they could not do this even with
                            the addition of a Swedish and Argentine tanker. On the other hand, if we
                            would supply their war essentials from the pool tanker tonnage they
                            could then take care of their ordering supplies with their boats.</p>
                        <p>I have taken the line that it is undesirable for them to withdraw from
                            the pool with which they have apparently agreed but their ideas of
                            requirements are so far above what they would get on the pool basis that
                            no satisfactory agreement seems even likely. However, we might trade
                            them into a position where they would undertake to supply such a
                            quantity for themselves as would require them to secure an Argentine or
                            a Swedish tanker. The latter may be possible by their trading a
                            transport allegedly now in Sweden for a tanker.</p>
                        <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0134"/>
                        <p>To me this is a breakdown of the pool but it must be admitted that there
                            is not now much incentive for any pool member to go out and attempt to
                            secure additional tonnage. You might wish to consider revising general
                            pool principles to the extent of allowing any member that provides
                            additional tanker tonnage to secure 50% of the vessel’s capacity for its
                            own essential use in excess of the formula. Personally I would prefer to
                            see the pool maintained and this country granted consideration by
                            essentials subcommittee for certain additional requirements despite the
                            unhappiness it will create although you will understand that nothing we
                            can do on the basis of existing principles will satisfy their present
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>Will you please indicate whether you desire to negotiate towards their
                            leaving the pool on the most advantageous terms possible to us or
                            continue them in the pool with the maximum of generosity possible within
                            existing principles. [Nuland.]</p>

                        <p>1422. Nuland from Thornburg. Embassy’s 2004 of November 17, 1942.
                            Department agrees that any arrangement under which any pool member uses
                            its own tankers to supplement share obtainable through pool will mean
                            that the pool has broken down. Obviously if all members took such steps
                            there would be no pool. This applies also to making such arrangements
                            for half or any other part of the capacity of locally controlled
                            tankers. It is recognized by the Department and by the pool
                            administration that the really essential needs of each republic must be
                            met, and the present procedure for determining and supplying those
                            essential requirements is believed to be adequate for the purpose of
                            guiding pool operations to that end. You should determine on the ground
                            what requirements should be classified as essential and advise
                            Department directly. Department will take immediate steps to instruct
                            pool administration accordingly. [Thornburg.]</p>

                        <p>2032. For Thornburg from Nuland. After meeting with local pool committee,
                            two members of which are also members of the Petroleum <pb n="121"
                                xml:id="pg_121" facs="0135"/>Commission and following further
                            meetings with the Commission and the Director of Petroleum
                                Rationing<note n="71" xml:id="d142fn71">Osvaldo Martinez.</note> all
                            thoughts of Chile’s leaving the pool seem to have been abandoned and a
                            better understanding of the realities of the pool’s operations seems
                            apparent.</p>
                        <p>In this improved atmosphere it has been possible to maintain the basic
                            pool principle of 40% of 1941 civilian requirements plus essentials. We
                            have agreed to recommend the following categories and estimated monthly
                            quantities in barrels per month: local military 3200; all air lines 170;
                            Anaconda 380; Braden 80; manganese mines 108; nitrate mines 1250; iron
                            mines 50; other copper mines 931; mineral trucking 7530; mineral
                            railways 50; mineral agriculture 1650; mineral labor transportation
                            2630.</p>
                        <p>This list includes and supersedes all former lists of essentials
                            including those now being used by the pool committee.</p>
                        <p>These figures have been arrived at by using the rationing authorities
                            estimates which were arrived at by multiplying the number of motor
                            vehicles engaged in the various operations by the rationed quantity of
                            gasoline for each of the various categories and it is considered that
                            the quantities to which they propose to ration are reasonable.</p>
                        <p>In addition it is recommended that Chile be allowed as essential 13,290
                            barrels of gasoline per month for December, January, February and March
                            only for urgent agricultural needs.</p>
                        <p>It is agreed that essentials will be supplied only to the industries
                            listed and that supplies are not merely being made available to Chile’s
                            general economy.</p>
                        <p>All changes in “A” essentials will only be made after submission to this
                            Embassy and subject to the established procedure for the creation of
                            essential categories. Chile’s diesel oil, fuel oil and kerosene
                            estimated requirements are admitted by the Commission to be so far out
                            of line that they cannot even be considered without careful review which
                            will take some time. Once this is done a request will be made to the
                            Embassy to establish certain categories of essentials in accordance with
                            the approved formula.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime it has been repeatedly emphasized that they will only be
                            supplied diesel and furnace oil on a 40 percent basis and continued
                            consumption at present rates will result in a stock shortage.</p>
                        <p>Chile will make available to the pool the full and improved use of her
                            two tankers and such deep tank and double bottom supplies as she can
                            arrange. Also any additional tonnage she can secure such as the <hi
                                rend="italic">Juncal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chile will also attempt to secure Swedish or other tankers as we may
                            indicate, provided the United States Government will reimburse <pb
                                n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0136"/>Chile for any cost in excess of
                            pool rates. Chile will also consider enlarging her present coal output,
                            reducing her present consumption or purchasing coal from Australia to be
                            delivered by War Shipping Administration ships now allegedly running
                            empty from Australia to Chilean ports. We should develop this
                            possibility in Washington and advise the Embassy here as to what can be
                            done. Such additional coal could be used as a substitute for fuel oil,
                            thus reducing Chile’s tanker tonnage requirements. There was no question
                            raised regarding military reserve stocks nor of the 10,000 barrels of
                            aviation gasoline.</p>
                        <p>I fear that it cannot be said that they are fully satisfied but they are
                            at least willing to go along for the time being on the present basis. If
                            the formula submitted herein is approved the figures can be supplied the
                            essentials subcommittee with the full recommendations of this Embassy
                            and the pool committee. It is anticipated that approval will date from
                            November 1 and that this Embassy and the local pool committee will be
                            notified as soon as possible so that appropriate stocks may be made
                            available.</p>
                        <p>This formula will result in total supplies to Chile of approximately
                            10,000,000 liters per month for the four months December, January,
                            February and March and 7,500,000 liters thereafter. This is something
                            less than was considered necessary in Buenos Aires despatch number 6292
                            dated August 26, 1942<note n="72" xml:id="d142fn72">Not printed.</note>
                            and is a considerable reduction from the request of the Chilean
                            Government for a minimum of 14,000,000 liters per month.</p>
                        <p>If constant pressure can be maintained on the Chilean Government it may
                            be able to supply sufficient tonnage to take care of a part of the
                            proposed increase.</p>
                        <p>You appreciate that what we have done is to rearrange the classification
                            between essentials and nonessentials.</p>
                        <p>The proposed formula has the following advantages: (1) It has driven home
                            and gained respect for the fundamental pool principles. (2) It should
                            accelerate the rationing activities of the Chilean Government. (3) It
                            will maintain pool principles of distribution. (4) It has reduced the
                            Chileans previous estimates of their minimum requirements and supplies
                            to considerably less than they considered absolutely necessary. (5) It
                            causes additional agricultural supplies to expire at the end of four
                            months, thus paving the way for further reductions. (6) It provides an
                            incentive for Chile to secure outside tonnage since they now appreciate
                            that of the essentials supplied the southern division of the pool by
                            pool tankage Chile receives over <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0137"
                            />66⅔% although their contribution to the pool to date has been only two
                            poorly operated small tankers.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed that the Chilean authorities will now formally present
                            their request for special consideration for gasoline requirements to the
                            Embassy and these will be forwarded to you in the usual manner. Later
                            diesel and fuel oil will be formally presented as will all requests for
                            change in the quantities or categories deemed essential.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile it is suggested that this telegram be considered advance notice
                            of the formal gasoline request so that it may be dealt with immediately
                            and I am assuming that for political reasons and on the instructions of
                            the Department these recommendations will be immediately approved by the
                            essentials subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>As there is nothing further that I can do here Mr. Clover and I expect to
                            depart for Buenos Aires on Sunday the 22nd and Mr. Merritt,<note n="73"

                        <p>212. In slip to reliable American contact recently, Chilean
                            Superintendent of Banks stated that following December 7th attack on
                            Pearl Harbor Axis interests withdrew 60,000,000 pesos from Chilean
                            banks. Realizing too late that an American was present he added that
                            most of this sum had been redeposited. Contact doubts whether redeposits
                            were more than 10,000,000 pesos. If this estimate is correct Axis

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on May
                            13, 1942, Mr. Stuart Petrie, a British official of the Compañía Sud
                            Americana de Explosivos of Valparaiso, which is jointly owned by du Pont
                            and Imperial Chemicals, called on an officer on my staff to inquire
                            regarding the likelihood that his firm may be granted permission by the
                            Exchange Control Commission to purchase dollars with which to remit
                            profits accumulated to the credit of American stockholders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petrie was told that from all indications the exchange situation had
                            greatly improved and would continue to improve as the result of large
                            United States purchases of Chilean raw materials, especially copper, the
                            increased return of dollars from copper because of the special 1¼ cent
                            per pound tax, and the increasing difficulty experienced by Chile in
                            making purchases in the United States as a consequence of the diversion
                            of productive efforts to war needs.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question as to what attitude he had found at the Exchange
                            Control Commission, Mr. Petrie stated that Director Baltra had showed
                            him a list of requests for dollar exchange on the part of importers the
                            total of which was less than $1,000,000 and had stated that a few months
                            ago importers’ requests for dollar exchange totalled about $8,000,000.
                            Sr. Baltra made no promises but Mr. Petrie was encouraged to believe
                            that before long the Commission expected that it would have considerable
                            dollar balances available.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0139"/>
                        <p>Mr. Petrie was told, in reply to his question, that to date the Embassy
                            had not decided whether it would urge the Exchange Control Commission to
                            release dollars for the transfer of profits in the near future, but that
                            if such action were decided upon it would be only fair to present the
                            demands of all Americans with frozen funds rather than urging the
                            release of dollars in one or two cases.</p>
                        <p>It was observed that an individual concern might meet with greater
                            success by relying on its own resources rather than by inclusion in a
                            general request submitted on behalf of all firms wishing to transfer
                            profits to the United States. Mr. Petrie remarked somewhat ruefully that
                            he realized that this was so; some months ago, he stated, he had
                            obtained permission from the Exchange Control Commission to purchase
                            £30,000 to remit as profits to British stockholders; shortly thereafter
                            the Exchange Control Commission made a large block release of pounds
                            sterling for the liquidation of frozen British funds; Mr. Petrie had on
                            this occasion requested that his firm be granted permission to purchase
                            £25,000 but the permission granted was for only £15,000; when he
                            complained to the Commission he was told that the reduction had been
                            made at the request of the British Embassy which did not wish his firm
                            to have any share in the block allotment since it had already received
                            £30,000 while other firms were receiving only about half what they
                            requested. Mr. Petrie stated that the profits accumulated for transfer
                            to American stockholders totalled about 18 million pesos which at the 31
                            peso per dollar rate amounts to just under $600,000.</p>
                        <p>Early in January 1942, an official of the West India Oil Company
                            (subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) informed the Embassy
                            that his firm had accumulated about $500,000 dollars in profits which it
                            wished to transfer to the United States as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The only other case which has come to the attention of the Embassy is
                            that of the Chilean branch of the Ford Motor Company. On May 18, 1942,
                            the Chilean manager, Sr. Matray, called and stated that Ford would like
                            to transfer some 20 million pesos (just under $650,000 at the 31 peso
                            per dollar rate) of accumulated profits, although it had in hand only
                            about half this sum at the moment since the rest was in part being used
                            as credits to distributors while a certain portion had already been
                            transferred by the old dodge of overvaluing imports.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that the Embassy should not press the Exchange Control
                            Commission to authorize American owned or controlled companies to
                            purchase dollars for the transfer of accumulated profits until Chile has
                            been able to build up considerable dollar balances in the United States,
                            a situation which may develop in the next few months. <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0140"/>In the meantime, of course, certain
                            more active firms may obtain permission to purchase dollars for this
                            purpose through their own efforts.</p>
                        <p>In this connection reference is made to article 17 of the draft law
                            granting the President of the Republic authority to effect changes of a
                            financial, economic and administrative character called for by
                            emergencies arising as a result of the world conflict. This measure, the
                            text of which was forwarded as an enclosure to my despatch No. 3201 of
                            May 5, 1942,<note n="76" xml:id="d145fn76">Not printed.</note> has been
                            approved by the Senate and is now pending in the Chamber of Deputies.
                            Article 17 authorizes the President of the Republic “to negotiate
                            conditions with the object of assuring the return of profits and
                            amortizations of new capital which is invested in the country in
                            productive activities.” Article 18 grants similar authority with respect
                            to capital invested in the iron, steel and related industries. In
                            commenting on these articles in his address before the Senate (a
                            translation of which was forwarded with the despatch under reference),
                            Minister of Finance Matte stated that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The State cannot disinterest itself in the consequences which
                                    can be suffered by our economy because of the shortage of credit
                                    and the lack of capital. To a primordial obligation, farsighted
                                    and stimulating, correspond the provisions of articles 17 and 18
                                    of the proposed law which the Senate is considering. In these,
                                    security and inducement to investment in Chile and in its
                                    productive activities are authorized for foreign capital.”</p>

                        <p>In an earlier section of his address discussing the progress amelioration
                            of the foreign exchange situation Sr. Matte stated that: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It should be noted that the total foreign money blocked in the
                                    country does not reach 5,000,000 dollars and naturally the
                                    amount must be declining progressively.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Embassy has not collected data in recent years on American blocked
                            funds, especially profits, in Chile since there appeared to be no
                            possibility that exchange existed for the unfreezing of such funds.
                            Through clearing, most frozen funds of European nationals were
                            liquidated prior to the war and, as mentioned above, under the payments
                            agreement with Great Britain considerable amounts have been unfrozen
                            during the war largely because of the inability of the British to supply
                            Chile with the goods the latter would like to purchase.</p>
                        <p>There is a possibility that President Ríos and his Finance Minister may
                            consider a considerable relaxation of foreign exchange controls
                            especially if substantial dollar balances accumulate. Such a development
                            would be of much greater importance than the unfreezing of two <pb

                            indicates vigorous action to achieve the latter should not be taken at

                        <p>927. In conversation yesterday Del Pedregal now President of the Fomento
                                Corporation<note n="77" xml:id="d146fn77">The Chilean Development

                                xml:id="d146fn79">Donald R. Heath, Counselor of Embassy.</note> that
                            he had just been advised by Fomento’s representation in New York that
                            the United States Government was disposed to assist in Chilean
                            acquisition of Proclaimed List firms provided funds could be blocked.
                            Del Pedregal said that the Fomento Corporation was very anxious to take
                            over Osram<note n="80" xml:id="d146fn80">Fábrica de Ampolletas

                            uncoerced purchase but under Chilean law had no way to block funds;
                            secondly, he said the sellers were afraid to receive blocked funds;
                            fearing Chile’s later entrance into the war and a resultant partial or
                            total loss of such blocked funds. He asked for an argument or methods
                            with which to overcome the sellers’ reluctance. He said the Fomento
                            Corporation had been given some thought instead of purchasing these
                            firms to renting them or to acquiring them on a long term combined
                            rental purchase plan.</p>
                        <p>We learn that Grace and Company has been approached by Fomento to take
                            over the management of Osram and that Raúl Simón<note n="82"

                            Mission concerning the transfer of dollar funds held in the Banco de
                            Chile for the account of the Sociedad Agrícola e Industrial San Pedro to
                            the Banco Central de Chile for the account of the Banco Alemán
                            Transatlántic. The Sociedad Agrícola e Industrial San Pedro is an
                            offshoot of the now dissolved firm of Wagner, Chadwick y Cía. and the
                            partners, particularly Ernesto Wagner, are well known Nazis or Nazi
                            sympathizers. Both the Sociedad and Ernesto Wagner were recommended for
                            publication in the Proclaimed List in despatch No. 3317 of May 14,
                                1942,<note n="84" xml:id="d147fn84">Not printed.</note> and have

                            there is nothing that can be done even in an informal way, but the
                            matter is being called to the Department’s attention as a further
                            example of the noncooperation on the part of the Chilean Government and
                            the impossibility of preventing transfer of dollar funds to Proclaimed

                            separately, the Treasury would advise the bank of all currency found
                            without Axis taint and the bank would then reimburse the owner in pesos
                            at D. P. rate or with a dollar draft. Tainted currency would be
                            deposited in an account of the Central Bank to the credit of the owner
                            to be released after the war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was not enthusiastic over the suggestion that the Embassy
                            be provided with a copy of the certificate of each owner but agreed that
                            a representative of the Embassy could examine such certificates
                            especially when large amounts are involved.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the Central Bank has not the authority to prohibit imports
                            and exports of trade in the country in dollar currency by <pb n="130"
                                xml:id="pg_130" facs="0144"/>private persons, and that any such
                            action would have to be taken by the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>Please inform me urgently whether the procedure outlined is acceptable to
                            the Treasury Department since the Secretary of the Central Bank has
                            requested the opinion of the Embassy by Monday afternoon.</p>

                        <p>884. Your 1266, August 7, 6 p.m. It is unfortunate that the Central Bank
                            is not prepared to prohibit the import and export of dollar currency or
                            to prohibit the holdings of and dealings in dollar currency by private
                            persons in Chile. Since this problem appears to have arisen because of
                            apparent lack of authority by the Central Bank, you are requested to
                            bring this to the attention of the Finance Minister and to endeavor to
                            persuade him to take the necessary steps toward the promulgation of
                            appropriate legislation for the purpose of carrying out a program of
                            currency control as outlined in the Department’s circular telegram of
                            June 19, 1942, 11 p.m.<note n="89" xml:id="d150fn89">Not printed, but
                                see <ref target="frus1942v05#pg_798">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >v</hi>, p. 798</ref>, footnote 52.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>You should point out to the Finance Minister that in order to make
                            controls over dollar currency effective it is necessary to prohibit the
                            import and export of dollar currency from Chile except direct currency
                            movements between the Central Bank and the United States and except for
                            small amounts for travelers between the United States and Chile. Once
                            this step has been taken it will be necessary to prohibit both the
                            holding of and dealings in dollar currency by private persons in Chile
                            in order to minimize the possibility of a black market.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the program outlined in your telegram under reference
                            there would appear to be no objection thereto although the program falls
                            far short of achieving effective control over the movement of dollar
                            currency. It is assumed that once this program has been put into effect
                            the Central Bank will not cash any more dollar currency (except small
                            amounts for travelers) but will accept such dollars on a collection
                            basis only and that the dollars will be shipped to the United States and
                            no action will be taken with respect thereto until an appropriate
                            decision has been made by the Treasury Department. In this latter
                            connection it is suggested that with respect to such currency which is
                            not released by Treasury there is no need for the depositor to be given
                            any credit at all since the Central Bank is merely a collecting agent
                            and that, in any event, the Central Bank <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"
                                facs="0145"/>should not make any commitment with respect to its
                            release after the war. For your information the Central Bank might find
                            such a commitment embarrassing if the Treasury Department should in the
                            future decide to take steps more drastic than blocking with respect to
                            tainted currency.</p>
                        <p>In notifying the Secretary of the Central Bank of your attitude toward
                            the proposed plan you should make it clear that there will be no
                            guarantee whatsoever that the Treasury Department will release any of
                            the currency forwarded to the United States from Chile.</p>

                                    the supervision of an agency of the Chilean Government,
                                    questionable operations appear to be so freely conducted that
                                    inimical firms and individuals are able to carry on financial
                                    transactions with Axis countries and occupied
                                    territories.</item>

                        <p>These conditions, together with the continuance of diplomatic relations
                            with the Axis powers, have the effect of facilitating the development of
                            subversive activities and the dissemination of inimical propaganda in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>The net effect of these factors is a menace to hemispheric defense which
                            the Department and other interested agencies of this Government have
                            viewed with growing concern. Alone among the American republics Chile
                            has made no move to curb within her borders trading and financial
                            transactions harmful to hemispheric interests or to prevent commercial
                            intercourse with the Axis powers and at times has taken steps
                            affirmatively beneficial to the enemies of the other American republics.
                            In this latter connection there may be mentioned specifically the
                            deliberate intervention of Chilean government agencies to compel the
                            delivery to Proclaimed List firms of materials essential to their
                            continued operation and also the numerous instances in which difficulty
                            has been placed in the way of diverting shipments from Proclaimed List
                            consignees.</p>
                        <p>The Department therefore agrees with the opinion expressed in your
                            despatch no. 3376 that the time has come to take up with the Chilean
                            Government the whole question of economic and financial control of Axis
                            activities in Chile and the related problem of cooperation with our
                            Proclaimed List policies, with specific reference to the implementation
                            of Resolutions V and XL of the Rio Conference.<note n="94"

                            Systems of Economic and Financial Control<note n="95" xml:id="d151fn95"
                                >See <ref target="frus1942v05#pg_58">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                            was adopted for dealing with Axis economic and financial activities in
                            the American republics. A circular instruction<note n="96"
                                xml:id="d151fn96">Dated August 4, 1942, <ref

                                    <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 58</ref>.</note> outlining the
                            results of this conference is being sent to you concurrently with this
                            instruction. Although the Chilean delegate to this conference made a
                            general reservation to the resolutions which were adopted, such
                            reservation stated merely that the “recommendations do not alter the
                            obligations devolving upon my country as a result of Recommendation V”
                            of the Rio <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0147"/>Conference. For your
                            information, the Department believes that the recommendations at the
                            recent conference in Washington do not in any sense alter or extend the
                            provisions of Resolution V of Rio, but that they merely specify in
                            detail the manner in which the controls shall be placed in effect.
                            Furthermore, the Chilean delegate made a general statement at the
                            opening session of the conference in which he explained the reasons for
                            Chile’s failure to adopt any legislation on the subject, and expressed
                            Chile’s willingness to adhere to any recommendations made by the
                            conference. A copy of this statement is enclosed.<note n="97"
                                xml:id="d151fn97">Not printed.</note> It is hoped that this
                            statement may be indicative of a more helpful attitude in the future
                            than has been displayed in the past.</p>
                        <p>In agreeing with your observation that the time has come to review this
                            whole question with the Chilean Government, the Department further
                            agrees that in view of the factors outlined above, the problem can now
                            be attacked by making representations directly to the Chilean Foreign
                            Office about the over-all situation. However, it is suggested that,
                            after the general representations have been made, the Embassy follow up
                            such representations by continuing to discuss specific cases with the
                            appropriate authorities. The Department’s experience in the field of
                            economic warfare has shown the value of continued consultation on
                            specific cases, particularly because of the educational value to the
                            other government.</p>
                        <p>You are accordingly requested to take up the subject with the Chilean
                            Foreign Office in such manner as you deem appropriate. In so doing you
                            may make such reference as seems desirable to the considerations set
                            forth in this instruction. You should also point out that while we have
                            every desire to assist in maintaining the continued operations of firms
                            essential to the Chilean economy, it is impossible for us to justify to
                            the people of this country, who are being asked to make increasingly
                            severe sacrifices, the furnishing of goods and materials that may fall
                            into the hands of enemy firms or firms in which there is an enemy
                            interest, so long as no local control is exercised over the commercial
                            and financial activities of such firms. It should be emphasized that, in
                            the absence of appropriate controls, the United States Government will
                            be compelled in its economic and financial relations with Chile, and
                            specifically in the allocation of materials and commodities and in the
                            provision of shipping facilities, to recognize that the continuance of
                            shipments from the United States to Chile contributes directly or
                            indirectly to aid the enemies of this country and of the other American
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Chile has been discussed in detail with the British
                            Embassy in Washington, and the British Government has been informed of
                            the step which this Government is proposing to take as <pb n="134"
                                xml:id="pg_134" facs="0148"/>outlined in the present instruction. As
                            a result of these discussions the British Government already has
                            instructed the British Ambassador in Santiago to make similar
                            representations. It has been emphasized that the action taken is to be
                            independent rather than concerted. Naturally, no reference should be
                            made in any document delivered to the Chilean Government as to the
                            discussions with the British or as to their proposals for action along
                            these lines.</p>
                        <p>With particular reference to Osram<note n="98" xml:id="d151fn98">See
                                telegram No. 927, June 7, 5 p.m., from the Ambassador in Chile, <ref
                                    target="#pg_127">p. 127</ref>.</note> it is obvious that a
                            solution can be found by the Chilean Government if it so desires. This
                            Government certainly cannot be expected to sympathize with the apparent
                            Chilean wish not to offend the German Government or the German interests
                            involved. The United States Government would be glad to see the German
                            interests in the company taken over by Chilean, provided the proceeds
                            accruing to the German owners from such a step could be effectively
                            blocked. As you know, the International General Electric Company has
                            inquired as to the attitude of this Government in regard to the
                            acquisition of Osram by W. R. Grace &amp; Company. Such a purchase would
                            not be viewed favorably, although there would be no objection to the
                            participation of American capital in any new company that might be
                            formed or to the employment of American technical experience in the
                            operation of the company’s plant.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Sociedad Lanera the position is essentially the same as
                            with Osram. This Government would be pleased to see the company acquired
                            by Chilean interests if payment is blocked.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the general question of taking over inimical firms in
                            the other American republics by Government action, your attention is
                            directed to Resolution VII adopted at the recent Inter-American
                            Conference in Washington<note n="99" xml:id="d151fn99">Resolution VII of

                            statements therein concerning the general policy of this Government
                            against removing enemy-owned firms from the Proclaimed List on the basis
                            of provisional controls such as intervention. Our experience has shown
                            that controls of this latter type are usually administered laxly, and
                            they are subject to the further objection that they preserve intact the
                            enemy interest.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 1266 of August 7, 6 p.m. and to the Department’s telegraphic reply
                            No. 884 of August 8, 6 p.m., following the receipt of which I wrote a
                            personal letter to the Foreign Minister. On August 5, 1942, Señor Barros
                            Jarpa advised me orally that any idea of forcing American companies to
                            loan their pesos to the Chilean Government had been abandoned following
                            his opposition to the proposal in a cabinet meeting.</p>
                        <p>I now have received a letter from the Foreign Minister dated August 10,
                            1942, with which he enclosed a copy of a letter dated August 7, 1942, he
                            received on the subject from the Finance Minister. Copies in translation
                            of both letters are enclosed.<note n="1" xml:id="d152fn1">Neither
                                printed.</note> The letter of the Finance Minister gives assurance
                            that the operation in question will not be forced on any American
                            company. He appears to believe, however, that they would find it in
                            their interest to accept since they would then be guaranteed the
                            transfer of accumulated funds over a five year period. This conclusion
                            might have been valid two or three years ago when Chile was having a
                            hard time finding enough exchange to pay for the imports it considered
                            essential. Now, due to greatly increased United States purchases of
                            Chilean products, and reduced Chilean imports from the United States as
                            a result of rationing, it is probable that Chile will find its current
                            surplus of dollar exchange growing and from the exchange standpoint
                            Americans with blocked funds should have every reason to hope that they
                            will be able to transfer them over a relatively short period.</p>
                        <p>Although nothing was said about it in my interview with the Foreign
                            Minister or in the letter of the Finance Minister, it is not unlikely
                            that the whole scheme was prompted by a need to borrow peso funds, and
                            not by any actual or anticipated shortage of foreign exchange. While one
                            must have great sympathy for the difficulties of a Finance Minister in a
                            period of rising prices and an expanding budget while some normal
                            revenues are shrinking, the Chilean Government could, of course, apply
                            the yield of the extraordinary copper tax to fill the gap if it so
                            desired.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>I shall take no further action regarding the matter unless I learn of
                            direct pressure on American firms. By refusing to permit the release of
                            exchange to firms not accepting his proposal the Minister of Finance
                            can, of course, bring indirect pressure. Cabinet changes are not
                            infrequent in Chile, however, and if some firms find that their refusal
                            to accept the offer of the Minister prejudices their requests for
                            exchange, it is not unlikely that in the normal course of events a new
                            Finance Minister will assume office who lacks the incumbent’s partiality
                            for this particular scheme.</p>

                        <p>A–96. From several sources the Embassy has learned that many holders of
                            American currency in Chile are unwilling to turn them over to the
                            Central Bank because of a lack of assurance against loss. The form
                            signed by the owner in surrendering currency (see enclosure No. 2 to my
                            despatch No. 4131, August 8, 1942<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">Not
                                printed.</note>) specifically exempts the Central Bank from all
                            responsibility including loss or damage in transit and although
                            Secretary Dávila of the Central Bank denied rumor that shipments will
                            not be insured (last paragraph my Airgram A–81 August 20, 4 [<hi
                                rend="italic">6:30</hi>] p.m.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn4">Not
                                printed.</note>), persons turning over currency are not being told
                            of blanket coverage of such remittances under British insurance. In fact
                            the attitude of some of the Bank’s employees meeting the public appears
                            to be to discourage as far as possible the surrender of currency for
                            collection. This is not surprising since the Central Bank from the start
                            opposed the whole arrangement and is only concentrating and shipping
                            American currency on Governmental orders.</p>
                        <p>If the whole program of control of American currency is not to be
                            hampered in Chile the public in possession of American currency will
                            have to be assured that they will be protected against loss during
                            shipment. To force the issue I suggest that the Treasury Department
                            offer to the Central Bank insurance covering all American currency
                            shipped at as low a rate as possible. If such an offer is made whether
                            accepted or not the Embassy could give wide publicity to the fact that
                            owners of currency surrendered are protected against losses in
                            transit.</p>

                            <item>The Department agrees that some exemption is necessary whereby
                                travelers from the United States to Chile may promptly convert a
                                small amount of dollars into local currency. Accordingly, Treasury
                                is prepared to release for free use in the United States small
                                amounts (not in excess of $250 to each traveler from the United
                                States to Chile) purchased by the Central Bank. It would be
                                preferable if the amount of such exemption could be established
                                administratively and would be flexible instead of by decree and if
                                the amount could be lowered to $100. Similarly, the exemption for
                                travelers from Chile to the United States should be lowered. For
                                your information only, it is expected that the present exemption of
                                $250 which may be brought into the United States will soon be
                                lowered. With respect to currency brought by travelers from the
                                United States to Chile, Treasury would expect that the Central Bank
                                would purchase only the amount exempted, specifying to Treasury the
                                name of the traveler, the date and amount purchased, and that any
                                excess over the exemption would be impounded and sent to the United
                                States on a collection basis.</item>

                                contribute to the recognition of the Proclaimed List by the Chilean

                            <item>It is believed that a termination date for presenting currency to
                                the Central Bank should be specified in the decree or by some other
                                law and that only a few days should be allowed for such presentation
                                in order to prevent currency movements from other countries into
                                Chile. You may inform the Central Bank that Treasury will consider
                                the failure to deposit currency within the time prescribed by
                                Chilean law as a ground for denying the application for the release
                                of such currency, in the absence of extenuating circumstances.
                                However, it should be made crystal clear that Treasury makes no
                                commitment whatever as to the treatment of currency before such
                                date.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You should request the appropriate Chilean officials to make certain that
                            all currency sent to the United States on a collection basis is
                            consigned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is fully documented,
                            and is accompanied by appropriate instructions from the Central
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean decree seems to be generally satisfactory but it is obvious
                            that strict administration will be necessary and it should be made clear
                            to the Chilean Government that the reaction of this Government to the
                            decree will depend upon its administration.</p>

                            or leaving Chile is reduced from $250 to $50; (2) persons possessing
                            American currency must deliver it to the Banco Central within 15 days;
                            (3) travelers arriving in Chile <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0153"
                            />must declare the amount of American currency they hold and deliver any
                            amount in excess of $50 to the customs authorities who will forward it
                            to the Banco Central.</p>
                        <p>The text of the new decree was supplied to the Embassy by the
                            Subsecretary of Hacienda<note n="8" xml:id="d156fn8">Francisco
                                Jorquera.</note> who stated that although it had already been signed
                            it could still be modified if necessary. After careful study it has been
                            suggested by the Embassy that it would be desirable to broaden Article 2
                            which now refers only to persons “domiciled or resident in Chile” and to
                            state that persons possessing American currency in Chile must deliver it
                            to the Banco Central within 15 days. This would make the provision in
                            question applicable to persons in other countries who might have
                            currency in Chile in safe deposit boxes or otherwise. An attempt was
                            made to have a shorter period than 15 days fixed but it was explained
                            that this would not be possible on account of the extreme length of the
                            country and the considerable time which might be required for the
                            transit of currency from distant points such as Punta Arenas to
                            Santiago.</p>
                        <p>In the second paragraph of Article 3 which now refers only to the
                            establishment of regulations for the sale of American currency by
                            travelers it has been suggested that the words “or purchase” be added
                            since it is desirable to cover buying as well as selling operations. The
                            Embassy is asking the Consejo Nacional to consult with it in the
                            drafting of the regulations in question.</p>
                        <p>Assurances have been given by the Subsecretary of Hacienda that the
                            Embassy’s suggestions will be embodied in the final text of the decree
                            before it is promulgated.</p>

                                n="9" xml:id="d157fn9">Not printed.</note> and my despatch number
                            4958, November 16, 1942. Subsecretary of Hacienda advises that decree,
                            translation of which was enclosed in above despatch, will be published
                            early next week probably on Monday in the <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                Oficial</hi> with the following change: 1. Article II is made
                            applicable to all persons possessing American currency in Chile and 2,
                            article III last paragraph now requires <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                facs="0154"/>Consejo Nacional de Comercio Exterior to regulate both
                            purchases and sales of American currency in amounts of $50.</p>
                        <p>Subsecretary stated Chilean Government will issue directives to customs
                            authorities to enforce law but no other steps other than those
                            specifically mentioned in law will be taken for the present.
                            Subsecretary says it appears impractical to ascertain information as to
                            currency held in safety deposit boxes or otherwise hoarded and that
                            there could be no censorship of mails until Chile adopted censorship
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>Subsecretary suggests that United States Government announce through
                            Embassy that dollar currency hereafter coming from Chile will be of no
                            value unless turned over to Banco Central de Chile within the 15-day
                            period specified in the decree. Unless instructed to the contrary, upon
                            publication of decree the Embassy will issue a statement to the press
                            embodying the points contained in the second and third sentences of
                            section C of the Department’s telegram number 1149 of September 10 [<hi
                                rend="italic">30</hi>] 10 p.m. which points have already been
                            transmitted to the Foreign Office in my note number 1461, October 21, a
                            copy of which was handed to the Secretary of the Central Bank late in
                            October. Embassy deems such publicity essential on day following
                            publication of decree.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has contacted representatives of Consejo and called their
                            attention to article III of decree and they agreed to consult Embassy
                            before drafting regulations pursuant to said article.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, pursuant
                            to his request, I called on the Minister for Foreign Relations, Dr. Luis
                            López de Mesa, on the morning of February 14. Our conversation is
                            summarized in the attached memorandum,<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> which I dictated immediately upon my return to the
                            Chancery.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Foreign Minister believes that the war will be
                            long drawn out but that the democracies will finally win. Likewise, he
                            fears a Japanese aggression on some one of the Latin American Republics.
                            As a result, but without in the slightest committing himself to the
                            accomplishment of any proposals which we may make, he nevertheless
                            desires to know what steps the United States believes Colombia should
                            take in the matter of hemisphere defense.</p>
                        <p>As will be observed from the enclosed memorandum, when replying to the
                            Minister I divided the subject into two parts: (1) I urged the necessity
                            for a continued and augmented activity in respect to Axis nationals in
                            this country in order to prevent any subversive activity. (2) While
                            emphasizing the complete dedication of the Department and this Embassy
                            to respect for Colombian sovereignty and a consideration at all times
                            for the sensibilities of these people, I mentioned several possibilities
                            with which I was acquainted of action which might be taken by the
                            Colombian Government of a military nature and which in my opinion would
                            be considered desirable by the United States Army.</p>
                        <p>I was able to present to the Minister only the isolated suggestions so
                            far advanced by our military and with which I am familiar; but it will
                            be observed that what he really desires is a complete plan. There is
                            thus presented to us an unusual opportunity to express our wishes <pb
                                n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0156"/>frankly to the Colombian
                            Government, and I request that I be instructed in the premises.</p>

                                personnel to the United States petroleum companies operating in
                                Colombia for the conduct of air-surveillance activities in the
                                Llanos area. This consent is given on the basis that the planes not
                                carry military insignia or identification or armament and that the
                                officers and men not wear uniforms. In order that the President of
                                Colombia may be advised when the planes and their personnel enter
                                Colombia, the War Department is requested to advise the Ambassador
                                at Bogotá of the contemplated arrangements. This information may; be
                                conveyed, if desired, directly to the Ambassador by the Commanding
                                General, Caribbean Defense Command.”<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">Lt.

                        <p>198. Because of the potentialities of the Caribbean situation, the War
                            Department desires to send officers at the earliest possible moment to
                            Medellín, Barranquilla and Cúcuta to perform the functions of military
                            observers as defined in the Department’s telegram no. 114 of January 30,
                                1942.<note n="6" xml:id="d160fn6">Not printed; it stated that the

                        </p>
                        <p>In view of the attitude of President Santos concerning military and naval
                            observers, as reported by you, the Department proposes <pb n="143"
                                xml:id="pg_143" facs="0157"/>that the Army officers sent to Medellín
                            and Barranquilla be designated “Assistants to the Consul” at these two
                            posts. They would not use their Army titles; would wear civilian dress;
                            and would otherwise endeavor to avoid attracting attention as Army
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>To meet the known views of President Santos, the Department proposes to
                            open a Consulate at Cúcuta at once and assign a career Foreign Service
                            Officer there so that the Army officer concerned may also be designated
                            “Assistant to the Consul”.</p>
                        <p>The Department recognizes that this arrangement may not be precisely what
                            President Santos had in mind when he stated that there would be no
                            objection to the establishment of whatever number of consulates this
                            Government had need for. It is, however, not a feasible procedure for
                            the officers of the War Department to be taken in to the Foreign
                            Service. It is hoped, therefore, that the President, in view of the
                            impossibility of attaining exactly what he wanted, will go along with
                            the arrangement hereinbefore described.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to ascertain whether the foregoing proposals would be
                            acceptable to the Colombian Government and to report to the Department
                            by telegraph promptly as the matter is extremely urgent.</p>

                        <p>232. The program outlined in Department’s telegram no. 198, February 19,
                            2 p.m., entirely coincides with President Santos’ desires. The only
                            conditions in addition to an intimation mentioned in Department’s
                            telegram under reference which should be clearly understood by the army
                            officers appointed are that so far as the Colombian Government is
                            concerned they will be regarded as members of our consular organization
                            and the respective Consulates and this Embassy will be responsible
                            before the Colombian Government for them and their activities. The
                            President is not concerned as to whether or not our army officers are
                            actually taken into the Foreign Service.</p>
                        <p>Since the President thoroughly understands this entire situation and the
                            objectives we seek and in order that the Department may not be delayed
                            in its arrangements, I consider it preferable not to inquire from him
                            whether this program is acceptable but instead simply to inform him at
                            the earliest opportunity of the action being taken.</p>
                        <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0158"/>
                        <p>It is requested that until the Department instructs the Embassy to ask
                            for permission to open Consulate at Cúcuta, and until such permission
                            has been granted, no publicity there to be given and no Foreign Service
                            Officer or “Assistant to the Consul” for that post arrive in
                            Colombia.</p>
                        <p>Subject to the foregoing there is no reason why the Assistants to the
                            Consuls at Medellín and Barranquilla should not proceed to these posts
                            immediately, telegraphic advice being given this Embassy so that I may
                            formally notify Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p>201. The recent attack by hostile submarines against Aruba and oil
                            tankers in that vicinity has struck at the very heart of inter-American
                            defense interests in the Caribbean area and within about 700 miles of
                            the Canal. I understand the attack occurred before our recently arrived
                            ground troops had had time to set up their guns to provide the
                            additional defense which was considered of great importance.<note n="8"

                            serious in their effects upon our vital interests as well as those of
                            all of the other American republics, particularly those geographically
                            most adjacent.</p>

                            non-American powers. In submarine operations of the character under
                            reference such request for assistance in most cases will come too late

                            and Colombia agree with the Government of the United States that in
                            emergency cases of this character, the commanding general of the United

                            of Colombia and of Venezuela at the headquarters of General Andrews in
                            the Panama Canal Zone with the authority to confirm emergency
                            arrangements of this character without the delay which will ensue from
                            the need for consultation between the Governments most directly
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed that the action under reference would only be resorted to
                            in the case of extreme emergency where prompt action alone would serve
                            to safeguard the Canal and the common interests of the three countries
                            most directly involved.</p>
                        <p>Please take this matter up immediately with the President of the
                            Republic, or should you deem it preferable, with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. In essence what is proposed is that the government to
                            which you are accredited agree to send as liaison officer to General
                            Andrews’ headquarters in the Panama Canal Zone an officer of the highest
                            possible rank and responsibility who would be able to agree at a
                            moment’s notice with General Andrews upon the need for the taking of
                            emergency action which might involve the coastal areas or the
                            territorial waters of the Republics of Venezuela and of Colombia. The
                            utmost speed is necessary in cases of this character as I am sure the

                            General Andrews in the Panama Canal Zone would, of course, be furnished

                            rank. They would be treated as distinguished guests of the Government of
                            the United States.</p>

                        <p>239. Department’s telegram 196, February 18, midnight. I suggest that at
                            end of antepenultimate sentence of proposed letter the following be
                            inserted: “or that their military status otherwise be indicated in any
                            manner whatsoever”.</p>
                        <p>American companies now exploring concessions in the Llanos are Texas
                            Petroleum Company and Richmond Petroleum Company (subsidiary of Standard
                            Oil of California). Those exploring but not <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                                facs="0160"/>having concessions are Tropical Oil Company (subsidiary
                            of Standard Oil of New Jersey) and Socony Vacuum. I suggest that planes
                            be distributed among these companies and that arrangements to this end
                            be made with their executive officers in the United States and that
                            their representatives here be instructed through the Department and this
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>I have again discussed this matter with the President who gives his
                            complete approval.</p>

                        <p>212. Your 232, February 19, 1942. While the War Department has no
                            objection to its officers’ attached to the consulates in Colombia
                            wearing civilian dress, it believes they should have with them a set of
                            uniforms for emergency use. The War Department proposes to send the
                            uniforms to the Military Attaché in Bogotá for storage. It would be left
                            to your discretion when and if these uniforms should be worn.</p>

                                15th Naval District.</note> on April 21, the position of General
                            Pablo López as Colombian liaison officer with the United States military
                            authorities in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, the problem at present is that General
                            Andrews in the event of an emergency would wish to obtain immediate
                            approval direct from General López for the immediate despatch of
                            airplanes, troops or other craft to Colombian territory and, on the
                            other hand, President Santos under the constitution cannot delegate
                            authority to General López to give such permission. As the time element
                            would be all important in the event of an anticipated attack on the
                            Canal Zone or on Colombian territory, it would be impracticable from our
                            point of view for General López to communicate with his Government in
                            order to obtain authority for United States forces to enter Colombian
                            territory on the request of the United States Commanding Officer in the
                            Canal Zone. For obvious reasons, it would be impracticable to advise
                            General López long in advance of the specific military or naval plans
                            which we might contemplate in the event of a hypothetical enemy
                            invasion.</p>
                        <p>After discussing the situation with the Military and Naval Attachés and
                            with Lt. Colonel Hersum of the War Department, now temporarily in
                            Bogotá, I recommend for the Department’s consideration the following
                            procedure.</p>
                        <list>

                            <item>The United States military and naval authorities should draw up a
                                general plain [<hi rend="italic">plan</hi>] for submission to the
                                Colombian Government which would embrace such general movements as
                                might be contemplated in the event of an anticipated attack against
                                the Canal Zone or Colombian territory, such as the flight of
                                military and naval planes over Colombian territory, the landing of
                                troops necessary to prevent hostile invasion of Colombia, the entry
                                of vessels into Colombian waters and the right to follow enemy
                                planes or naval craft into Colombian waters under the doctrine of
                                hot pursuit. The foregoing is in harmony with the step which is
                                envisaged in paragraph 2 of Ambassador Braden’s telegram number 242,
                                of February 21, 5 p.m., to you and which apparently has not as yet
                                been taken.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Once such a plan were formulated, it would be presented by the
                                Embassy to the President of Colombia with the request that he
                                authorize General López that, in the event of an emergency, United
                                States military or naval forces might act in accordance with the
                                general provisions of the plan adopted. It would be understood that,
                                at the time of making the request as a result of an emergency,
                                specific information would be immediately furnished to General López
                                by the United States authorities in the Canal Zone regarding the
                                number of planes, men, vessels, etc., and the exact destination and
                                scope of the movement. Assurance would have to be given by the
                                Embassy that military or naval steps along the foregoing lines would
                                be <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0163"/>taken only in the event
                                of extreme danger to Colombia or Canal Zone territory, and that the
                                operations would be withdrawn as soon as the danger had
                                subsided.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I recommend that the Department discuss this situation with the War and
                            Navy Departments with a view to issuing joint instructions this Embassy
                            and to the Army and Navy commanders in the Canal Zone in order to insure
                            complete understanding and agreement in the future. From what I was able
                            to learn in the Canal Zone General López’ mission is under present
                            conditions of little value to our military authorities unless he can act
                            with authority in an emergency. It seems advisable therefore to
                            regularize the situation at the earliest possible moment, especially in
                            view of telegram received by the Military Attaché from General Andrews
                            on April 27 requesting permission for two army planes to arrive here on
                            April 29, with permission to make various reconnaissance flights in
                            Colombia. Minister of War has informed Keith that these flights would be
                            “inadvisable” at the present moment (probably due to forthcoming
                            election). The Minister’s decision has been conveyed to General Andrews
                            by the Military Attaché.</p>

                        <p>601. For the Under Secretary. My 574 April 30, 1 p.m. In the course of
                            conversation today with Minister of War he spontaneously brought up
                            question of General López and said that instructions have been issued to
                            the latter not to make any issue with the United States military
                            authorities in event of an emergency necessitating our forces entering
                            Colombian territory. Restrepo said if Japanese submarine entered
                            Colombian waters it must be sunk at all costs. Consequently, Colombian
                            Government wished to lend us every facility to enable us to do so.
                            Subsequent to our taking action against the enemy the matter of
                            permission for our forces to fly over or land in Colombia could be
                            discussed through diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>I informed Minister I proposed to discuss this question with President
                            Santos on Thursday<note n="14" xml:id="d167fn14">May 7.</note> or

                        <p>628. In accordance with telegram of May 10 received by Naval Attaché from
                            Chief of Naval Operations, stating Department concurred and requesting
                            permission to establish air fueling base on Old Providence Island to
                            combat submarine activities, I obtained oral permission today from
                            Ministry of War. Restrepo requested, however that gasoline barrels be
                            consigned to Pan American Airways at Old Providence Island stating that
                            permission granted would be in favor of Pan American Airways. While the
                            Minister did not specifically so state, I assume that consignment to Pan
                            American Airways is to avoid possible charge of violation of Colombian
                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Minister confirmed that United States planes may fly over and land on
                            that Island without restriction.</p>

                        <p>634. While discussing enemy submarine activities in Caribbean area
                            yesterday with Minister of War Restrepo said he would greatly appreciate
                            it if a United States Naval vessel could be assigned to patrol waters
                            adjacent to Goajira Peninsula especially due to temporary absence for
                            repairs of Colombian Naval vessels. Naval Attaché has informed Chief of
                            Naval Operations of foregoing.</p>
                        <p>In view of the large number of requests which we are continually making
                            of the Colombian Government on military and naval matters I recommend

                        <p>575. Your 601, May 5, 9 p.m. Are we correct in assuming on the basis of
                            the Minister of War’s instructions to General López not to make any
                            issue with United States military authorities in the event <pb n="151"
                                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0165"/>of an emergency necessitating our
                            forces entering Colombian territory, that General Andrews may without
                            prior and specific permission from the Colombian Government dispatch
                            United States Army task forces to cope with any situation which might
                            arise in Colombian waters or territories through enemy action? If this
                            understanding is correct, the War Department is entirely satisfied and
                            does not feel that it will be necessary to conclude an agreement
                            formalizing the right of United States armed forces to take whatever
                            action is indicated to cope with unforeseen emergencies. If, however,
                            you feel that a useful purpose would be served by concluding an
                            agreement with the Colombian Government providing that the two countries
                            may undertake operations on or over the lands and in or over the
                            territorial waters of the other country for the purpose of hemisphere
                            defense, when such action is urgently necessary, a draft of such an
                            agreement will be sent you for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that existing arrangements and
                            understandings with the Colombian Government are such that a formal
                            agreement is not necessary and perhaps would be undesirable.</p>

                        <p>687. Department’s No. 591, May 20, 8 p.m. When I informed President this
                            afternoon of my conversation with Minister Restrepo on May 5th I
                            inquired whether Restrepo’s statement was purely personal or whether it
                            represented opinion of the President.</p>
                        <p>Without directly answering my question the President said that “of
                            course” our Army or Navy forces may enter Colombian waters at any time
                            in pursuit of enemy craft. The only exception he made was that in the
                            event of submarines entering Colombian harbors such as Cartagena where
                            the craft could be immobilized by Colombian forces we would not follow
                            into port. He emphasized he wishes to give us every possible facility to
                            take action against the enemy not only in our interest but in interest
                            of Colombia as well.</p>
                        <p>President Santos said he would prefer to have no written agreement as
                            diplomatic instruments are often susceptible to misinterpretation on the
                            part of functionaries. He said he considered that a gentleman’s
                            agreement now exists between United States, that we have permission in
                            event of an emergency to send our forces into Colombian territorial
                            waters.</p>
                        <p>I replied that in my opinion a gentleman’s agreement would be preferable
                            to a written agreement but inquired whether this would be binding on his
                            successor. Santos said López<note n="18" xml:id="d173fn18">Alfonso López
                                was elected on May 3, 1942, to succeed Santos as President of
                                Colombia; he took office on August 7.</note> will follow Santos’
                            international policies. He suggested, however, that prior to López’
                            assumption of office the three of us should confer so as to bind all
                            personal arrangements now existing between Santos and this Embassy.</p>
                        <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>From my conversation I consider the arrangements approved by Department’s
                            No. 591, May 20, 8 p.m., now to be in effect.</p>
                        <p>Repeated to Panama for the information of General Andrews.</p>

                        <p>692. I failed to state in my 687 yesterday: It was also agreed between
                            President Santos and me that in event of necessity of General Andrews
                            ordering United States Army or Navy craft to enter Colombian territorial
                            waters General López would be immediately notified in detail regarding
                            destination, description et cetera of the forces involved so that he in
                            turn could at once advise the President.</p>

                        <p>700. My 687, May 22, 7 p.m. In conversation with President-elect López
                            last evening I referred to oral arrangement with President Santos to
                            permit our forces enter Colombian waters in event of emergency. López
                            expressed approval of this arrangement and said he would gladly continue

                        <p>725. Department’s 627, May 29, 8 p.m. From my conversation with Santos on
                            May 22, I understood that there was to be no restriction regarding the
                            type of United States forces which might enter Colombian territory.
                            Therefore in addition to territorial waters Colombian land would also be
                            included in the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>President-elect López was less specific than the President as is
                            understandable from the fact that at present López has no authority to
                            make commitments. The fact, however, that he said he would approve any
                            arrangement made between Santos and me would imply that he too would
                            approve assumption mentioned in Department’s 627.</p>

                            <item>Mr. Welles referred to the oral understanding which we now have
                                with President Santos to permit, in the event of an emergency,
                                United States forces to enter Colombian territory and Colombian
                                territorial waters and expressed the hope that this arrangement
                                could be continued with the government of Dr. López. Mr. Welles said
                                that Mr. Lane had fully explained to him Dr. López’ views and added
                                that we wished to follow the President-elect’s wishes as to the
                                manner in which the arrangement should be worked out. Dr. López then
                                explained that … he preferred to take Congress and the nation into
                                his confidence so that in case the necessity should arise he could
                                state that he had consulted Congress, or at least the Committee on
                                Foreign Relations. He expressed the conviction that the Colombian
                                people, regardless of party affiliations, enthusiastically supports
                                the present policy of collaboration with the United States but in
                                order to avoid possible future criticism of his government and of
                                the United States he would prefer to have either authority from
                                Congress to take emergency measures or an informal understanding
                                with the Foreign Affairs Committee to take the action which
                                President Santos had taken at our request. Mr. Welles enquired
                                whether the present arrangement with President Santos could be
                                considered to be in effect until such time as a new arrangement were
                                made with the government of Dr. López. The President-elect replied
                                in the affirmative.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Dr. López said that he had been somewhat worried by the status of
                                military and naval observers attached to some of the American
                                Consulates in Colombia. These observers were known officially as
                                assistants to the consuls but this subterfuge was generally public
                                knowledge. Mr. Lane said that the Army and Navy would prefer to come
                                out into the open in any way desired by the Government of Colombia.
                                The present arrangement had been made between President Santos and
                                Ambassador Braden. Mr. Welles then emphasized that the activities of
                                all representatives of other United States Government departments
                                should be known to the American Ambassador and should be entirely
                                under the latter’s control; furthermore that Mr. Lane should keep
                                the Colombian Government completely informed regarding such
                                activities. Mr. Welles also specified that all the information
                                obtained by our agents should be put at the disposition of the
                                Colombian Government; that the names of all agents would be
                                furnished to Dr. López after his inauguration; and that all agents
                                would cooperate with the Colombian authorities in such manner as Dr.
                                López might indicate. Mr. Welles assured Dr. López that our
                                activities had only one aim: the defense of the hemisphere.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Welles said that we had just received a request from General
                                Andrews to endeaver to obtain permission from the Colombian
                                Government to establish a base in Colombia, on the Caribbean, for
                                the purpose <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0170"/>of refueling
                                and servicing PBY flying ships. Mr. Lane said that he had
                                recommended to Mr. Bonsal<note n="21" xml:id="d179fn21">Philip W.
                                    Bonsal, Chief of the Division of the American Republics.</note>
                                that no action be taken on this request until after Dr. López’
                                inauguration, as an unfortunate impression might be created if
                                action were taken during the last few remaining days of the
                                administration of President Santos. Mr. Welles then requested the
                                Ambassador to ascertain from General Andrews, on his way through
                                Panama, the details of the project and discuss them with Dr. López
                                after his inauguration. Dr. López said that a project of this
                                importance should be discussed with Congress so as to allay possible
                                criticism. He again pointed out his complete support of our
                                objectives but in order that his support could be of the most
                                practical type, he wished it to be entirely constitutional and with
                                the advice and consent of the representatives of the people. Mr.
                                Welles observed that such procedure would be entirely consistent
                                with democratic principles and that he could well appreciate the
                                wisdom of Dr. López’ point of view.</item>

                        <p>A–25. With reference to Mr. Keith’s telegram No. 956 of July 21, 4
                                p.m.,<note n="22" xml:id="d180fn22">Not printed.</note> regarding
                            the request received through Brigadier General H. C. Ingles, Chief of
                            Staff, Headquarters Caribbean Defense Command, for the establishment of
                            an emergency operating base for Navy PBY airplanes in the vicinity of
                            Cartagena, Colombia, I have the honor to state that this project was
                            discussed by me with Lieutenant General F. M. Andrews, Rear Admiral Van
                            Hook, and Ambassador Wilson in Balboa on July 28, 1942. Admiral Van Hook
                            explained the need for such a base in order to lessen the distance of
                            flights of planes making reconnaissance surveys in that part of the
                            Caribbean traversed by convoys, as well as the detailed needs which
                            would be requested of the Colombian Government for the operation of this
                            base.</p>
                        <p>On my arrival in Bogotá I discussed the matter in general terms with
                            President Santos on July 29, stating that we are not yet prepared to
                            make the request for the base, but that I wished him to know of our
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>This morning in a conversation with the Minister of Foreign Relations on
                            other subjects, I adverted to our desire for such a base, pointing <pb
                                n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0171"/>out that it would be to the
                            advantage of Colombia for us to take the most adequate steps possible to
                            disrupt Axis submarine activities in the Caribbean. As I had previously
                            spoken to Dr. López de Mesa regarding the shipping situation, which is
                            to be made the subject of an interpellation in Congress this afternoon,
                            I pointed out the importance to Colombian economy that this base be
                            established.</p>
                        <p>In speaking to President Santos and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I
                            expressly did not refer to the project as the establishment of a “base”
                            but stated that we merely wished to have the privilege of facilities for
                            landing and servicing our planes including permission to maintain
                            sufficient personnel, supplies, radio station, and other necessary
                            equipment. I pointed out that all expenses in connection with the
                            establishment of the proposed installation would be borne by the United
                            States Government.</p>
                        <p>As agreed upon with the Department and with President-elect López, no
                            direct request of the Colombian Government for the establishment of the
                            foregoing base will be made until after the inauguration of Dr.
                            López.</p>

                        <p>A–29. Reference my airgram No. A–25, July 31, 6:30 p.m. Last evening I
                            discussed with President Santos at some length the proposed project at
                            Cartagena. He said that in his opinion it was of the highest importance
                            to Colombia to have such a base in operation and that there should be no
                            reason whatever why the government of Dr. López should not approve the
                            project. I advised the President that although I had informed Dr. López
                            regarding our intention, we had not made a formal request of Dr. Santos’
                            government as we feared an unfortunate impression might be created if
                            permission were granted during the last days of his administration. He
                            expressed a hearty concurrence and said that he appreciated our position
                            as it would be embarrassing for him to be called upon to pass on the
                            project at this time. I said that Dr. López had asked me to take the
                            matter up with him immediately following his inauguration.</p>

                            first step López said he would summon me and discuss advisability as to
                            next procedure. Echandía expressed agreement with López highly advisable
                            from internal point of view to have an understanding with congressional
                            leaders regarding oral agreement reached between President Santos and
                            ourselves (and latter [<hi rend="italic">later</hi>] confirmed by talk
                            between López and Under Secretary Welles in New York July 24<note n="26"

                        <p>Echandía and López both expressed agreement most delicate matter we had
                            raised is establishment naval seaplane base in Cartagena. They indicated
                            delicacy is due to internal political conditions in that district. As
                            President indicated he would turn matter over to Secretary General
                            Ministry Foreign Affairs for study. I am fairly sanguine there should be
                            no outstanding difficulty, González Fernández already having expressed
                            himself confidentially to me as being in favor of project. Both
                            President and Echandía indicated their full understanding <pb n="159"

                            Minister Echandía today regarding conversation reported in my 1050. I
                            expressed the opinion that the request of Minister of War should greatly
                            facilitate granting of our request for permission to maintain naval
                            airplane facilities at Cartagena which should also give Government,
                            provided Government agreed with us as to importance of maintaining such
                            facilities, an excellent argument with Congress in obtaining
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>Obviously the maintenance of air service between Cartagena and San Andrés
                            would be primarily for the benefit of Colombian population.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he agreed with my point of view and would call
                            Commission of Foreign Affairs of Congress for tomorrow morning and would
                            advise me as soon as conversation had taken place.</p>
                        <p>Both López and Echandía gave me to understand they approve in principle
                            our request for emergency seaplane base at Cartagena although they did

                                <item>That we establish hydroplane service between Cartagena and San

                                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0174"/>of furnishing

                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That we furnish aerial transportation for Colombian officer to
                                    San Andrés and return to mainland for the purpose of surveying
                                    present situation and needs of Archipelago.</item>

                                    boats be filled at once.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>When it was pointed out to the Minister that such a service would
                            necessitate arrangements at Cartagena for refueling and maintenance of
                            aircraft employed in this service the Minister stated that he would wish
                            us to take advantage of this situation to patrol coast line of Colombia
                            and thus make airplane serve double purpose to mutual interest of our
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that no action be taken on these requests pending approval of

                                xml:id="d185fn29">Not printed.</note> President López informed me
                            this afternoon Senate Foreign Affairs Committee this morning
                            “substantially approved” project for emergency naval seaplane base at
                            Cartagena as well as maintenance of our military and naval observers in
                            different sections of the country. López said he expects to obtain
                            concrete approval at meeting of Commission to be held tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>…López said he informed Commission that our Government had made no
                            intimation whatever regarding steps which he should follow and had made
                            no requests of him, and that purpose of his trip was merely to discuss
                            matters of mutual interest. President said that Commission expressed
                            itself very much satisfied by this statement and by our attitude of not
                            having attempted to force Colombia to follow our wishes.</p>
                        <p>As to Cartagena base, López said it would be most useful from internal
                            political standpoint if this could be operated in connection with
                            sending supplies by plane to San Andrés and Providence Islands, which
                            are critically in need of foodstuffs and medicinal supplies. I made no
                            definite commitment on this point but expressed the hope that some
                            arrangement might be worked out. López said he hoped General <pb n="161"
                                xml:id="pg_161" facs="0175"/>Andrews might shortly visit Colombia to
                            discuss with local officials, technical aspects of our proposed
                            operations in Colombia (I had already invited General Andrews to visit
                            me, at his convenience, to enable him to talk with the President and
                            other officials of this Government). As to military and naval observers,
                            López said that now that we have the virtual approval of the Senate and
                            other persons in Colombia, it will be a simple matter in deciding with
                            us on titles which they will use, but not “Assistants to the
                            Consul”.</p>

                                printed.</note> Secretary General of Foreign Office who is virtually
                            in charge of Ministry pending arrival of Turbay informs me President
                            López who is still ill requested him to advise me as follows: The
                            institution of weekly United States airplane service between Cartagena
                            and San Andrés for purpose of providing food and medical supplies to
                            Archipelago would greatly assist Government in its efforts to obtain
                            permission for maintenance of seaplane base in Cartagena. I was asked to
                            believe López does not desire to obtain plane service to San Andrés
                            without our obtaining <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> and naval
                            facilities at Cartagena. González said it is not a question of condition
                            but one of practical politics. If Government can show conservative
                            opposition that it is obtaining vital civilian aid from the United
                            States there should be no difficulty in obtaining authority for
                            establishment of military and naval facilities in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>As I have told you I believe in the sincerity of López. I do not believe
                            he would ask our assistance on San Andrés situation which all
                            well-informed persons describe as desperate unless he were willing to
                            grant us base in Cartagena. My informant gave me to understand in fact
                            President had already expressed his desire to have Cartagena project
                            established but for internal political reasons he does not wish to have
                            the two projects coming too closely associated or as having been granted
                            conditionally.</p>
                        <p>I have repeated my invitation to General Andrews to visit Bogotá.</p>
                        <p>May I suggest you urge on War and Navy Departments great desirability of
                            establishing seaplane service between Cartagena and <pb n="162"
                                xml:id="pg_162" facs="0176"/>San Andrés and that if this is not
                            granted negotiations for establishment of seaplane base at Cartagena
                            will be prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>I have not repeated this telegram to Panama.</p>

                            informed this Department that it considers it highly desirable that on
                            matters of military cooperation with Colombia General Andrews should
                            communicate direct with you. The War Department suggests that should you
                            believe in any particular case that it would be unwise to transmit to
                            the Colombian Government any request received from General Andrews, you
                            should inform General Andrews to that effect and endeavor to reach an
                            agreement with respect to the action to be taken prior to referring the
                            matter to Washington in order to avoid the necessity for consultation
                            between the State Department and the War Department.</p>
                        <p>This Department concurs with the War Department’s proposal for direct
                            communication between you and General Andrews but desires that, in the
                            event that you do not deem it advisable to follow the course of action
                            proposed by General Andrews in any given case, you should transmit to
                            the Department all of the pertinent correspondence in order that the
                            Department may inform you of its views.</p>

                        <p>1191. For the Under Secretary. My 1169, September 9, 1 p.m. President
                            López informed me today that since my last talk with him on September 9
                            he had sent [<hi rend="italic">seen?</hi>] Ascon President of Council of
                            State, who had advised him that in case he wished to refer matter of
                            base at Cartagena to Council for its opinion, opinion would be favorable
                            but that it was not necessary for López to do so.</p>
                        <p>He said that after further consideration he would prefer if my proposed
                            note to Foreign Office would be confined merely to request for base at
                            Cartagena. He said that as permission for our forces to enter Colombian
                            territory or Colombian waters remains in force as agreed with you in New
                            York, there is no present necessity to include this request and he would
                            prefer to await arrival of Turbay who is competent official to explain
                            matter to the Senate. President said that matter of military observers
                            is mere formality which can be arranged by me directly with Foreign
                            Office, he having already signified his approval.</p>

                            General Inglés and Ministers Echandía and Galvis,<note n="36"

                            President López today advised me that permission for establishment at
                            Cartagena of emergency service as outlined in point No. 2 in
                            Department’s 959 is definitely granted. As Echandía said that possible
                            constitutional objection might be raised regarding stationing of
                            seaplane tender and as Admiral Van Hook stated that, in view of granting
                            of other facilities at Cartagena, this point is not of pressing urgency,
                            no definite decision was taken on this point.</p>
                        <p>I showed President draft note based on Department’s 959 as well as
                            alternative draft which omitted point No. 1 in view of the President’s
                            request transmitted in my 1191.</p>
                        <p>President suggested that we transmit note along lines of draft

                        </p>
                        <p>President said his intention would then be to obtain consent of the
                            Senate for permission for our forces to follow enemy into Colombia.
                            Echandía expressed opinion that there would be no constitutional or
                            political objection in view of benefits accruing to Colombian defense as
                            result of arrangement and in view of Colombia’s definite interest in our
                            measures against our enemies. Echandía said that unless resolutions

                            Echandía said there was no necessity to obtain Senate approval for

                        <p>972. The President requests you to deliver the following message from him
                            to President López: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“During your recent visit to the United States, we exchanged
                                    views regarding measures which our two Governments might take in
                                    order to contribute to continental security. I have just had the
                                    great pleasure of learning from Ambassador Lane that your
                                    Government has taken a number of decisions which will enable the
                                    carrying out of these measures. I wish you to know how deeply I
                                    appreciate the friendly and helpful attitude which has made it
                                    possible to translate our conversations into effective
                                    action.</p>
                                <p>Please accept, my dear Mr. President, my warmest good wishes.

                        <p>1231. For Under Secretary. My despatch 816, September 18 and telegram
                            1201 September 16.<note n="38" xml:id="d194fn38">Neither printed.</note>

                        <p>Echandía handed me yesterday draft of note to be sent by me to him
                            substantially in accordance with that transmitted as enclosure 1
                            despatch 816 but also stating that permission to station tenders at
                            Cartagena had been granted by Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>Only important discrepancy with our draft note is that Echandía’s draft
                            refers to permission for “aerial and naval forces of the United States”
                            to enter Colombian territorial waters to fly over Colombian territory,
                            while we refer to permission for “armed forces of the United States” to
                            enter and fly over Colombian territory and to enter Colombian waters.
                            Change in phraseology undoubtedly due to constitutional stipulation that
                            Senate must give approval for permission for foreign troops to pass “in
                            transit” through Colombian territory. General Andrews informs me by
                            telegraph that the change in phraseology is acceptable him.</p>
                        <p>Draft note also states that we are prepared to defray cost of repairs to
                            the camp of the Cartagena base in event that Colombian Government
                            permits us to use it for beaching sea planes for overhauling and
                            repairs.</p>
                        <p>Echandía said that [he?] has advised the President that it will not be
                            necessary to request approval of the Senate with respect to concessions
                            to be granted in note which will answer ours. I have accordingly
                            addressed note<note n="39" xml:id="d194fn39">See <hi rend="italic"
                                    >infra</hi>.</note> marked strictly confidential to Foreign
                            Office along lines of Echandía’s draft sending copies to Department and
                            General Andrews by next courier.</p>
                        <p>Echandía stated that he will answer my note immediately and that
                            subsequently the Foreign Relations Commissions of Congress will be
                            advised in general terms of Governments policy based on resolutions
                            adopted at Habana and Rio justifying action in this case.</p>

                            purpose of attaining the maximum efficiency of cooperative measures
                            between the Governments of Colombia and of the United States of America
                            in matters <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0182"/>of hemisphere
                            defense, protection of Colombian, United States, and friendly shipping
                            in the Caribbean Sea, and the security of the Panama Canal, the
                            Caribbean Defense Command considers it necessary to be able to rely, in
                            Cartagena, on emergency fueling services and repair facilities for
                            airplanes and seaplanes of the Army and the Navy of the United States.
                            With the same objectives and in order to obtain these facilities without
                            loss of time for United States planes, my Government has had the honor
                            to request that while the necessary installations are being completed,
                            Your Excellency’s Government permit that tenders for seaplanes of the
                            United States Navy may enter Cartagena and remain in that port for such
                            period of time as may be indispensable to effect the necessary
                            refueling.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the conversations which I have had the honor to have
                            with Your Excellency, the Government of Colombia has granted permission
                            to organize these emergency services with the assignment of the
                            necessary personnel for the proper protection of the airplanes and
                            pertinent installations. The cost of these services will be at the
                            expense of the United States, the number and category of personnel to be
                            determined in agreement between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>My Government will also defray the expense of repairing the ramp for
                            seaplanes of the Base of Cartagena, if the Government of Colombia agrees
                            that it may be occasionally used, when it may be necessary to beach its
                            airplanes to overhaul or repair them.</p>
                        <p>In order that movements in pursuit of enemy ships or airplanes may be
                            more rapid and efficient, my Government also requests that the naval and
                            aerial forces of the United States under the Commanding Officer of the
                            Caribbean Defense Command be permitted to enter Colombian territorial
                            waters and fly over Colombian territory without prior special authority,
                            it being understood that the Caribbean Defense Command will immediately
                            give notification of such action to the liaison officer of the Colombian
                            Army stationed at the Headquarters of the Command.</p>
                        <p>If Your Excellency is favorably disposed, General Andrews, Commanding
                            Officer of the Caribbean Defense Command, or his deputy, will be pleased
                            to arrange with the military and naval authorities of Colombia the
                            specific details, in order to carry out the arrangements mentioned

                                the United States Government.</note> is prepared to enter into
                            commitment with Colombian Government to purchase entire production of
                            rubber in Colombia except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon)
                            necessary for domestic consumption, at 35 cents per pound c &amp; f
                            United States continental ports for usual good quality Colombian scrap
                            as understood in New York. It is understood that any Hevea type rubber
                            produced in Colombia is presumably exported through Brazil and loses its
                            identification as Colombian rubber. Purchases would be paid for on basis
                            of cash against shipping documents endorsed “on board” ocean carrying
                            vessel at Belém and such other places as may be deemed advisable by
                            Rubber Reserve and Colombia and subject to final price adjustment based
                            on quality inspection and net certified weights determined at port of
                            entry in United States. The term of the agreement would be to December
                            31, 1946, unless sooner terminated by mutual consent, price paid being
                            subject to change after expiration of first 2 years if conditions
                            change. The Government of Colombia would agree to restrict export
                            licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees. The exportation of
                            manufactured <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0185"/>rubber, if any,
                            would be restricted to the United States. Colombia would agree to use
                            its best efforts to cause maximum amount of rubber to be produced and
                            made available for sale to Reserve. Local labor would be financed
                            locally for necessities for collecting rubber. Some governmental agency,
                            if desirable, would be designated as the single buying agency, otherwise
                            sales would be made through usual trade channels now in existence. Price
                            on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as local sales price.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing proposal is similar to agreements entered into with Brazilian

                        <p>In order to give you background regarding the extreme urgency of the
                            rubber situation, which has led this government to request you to
                            institute immediate negotiations for the acquisition of the entire
                            rubber production of the country to which you are accredited, you are
                            advised of the following factors: <list>

                                <item>With the shutting off of far eastern sources of rubber
                                    (excepting only the Island of Ceylon) the nations which are
                                    directly producing armaments and implements of war,—namely, the
                                    United States, the United Kingdom and Canada,—are dependent for
                                    new crude rubber supplies entirely on the American republics and
                                    Africa—sources which have produced only a fraction of our
                                    needs.</item>

                                    military requirements and synthetic rubber plants are being
                                    rushed. Nevertheless, synthetic production will not be at full
                                    capacity before 1944, and in any event it is not at all certain
                                    that the use of crude rubber in tires and tubes can be entirely
                                    dispensed with.</item>

                                    that both the United States and the American countries united
                                    with us must dispense with all non-military uses of rubber not
                                    absolutely essential to the conduct of the war.</item>

                                    in this country to methods of saving crude rubber in manufacture
                                    and of developing substitutes, and the advantages of these
                                    improvements may be fully realized only if the maximum amount of
                                    crude rubber is turned over to this country.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>It is highly desirable that no one of the American Republics
                                    should acquire or use an amount of rubber disproportionate to
                                    the respective war or defense needs of that country and of the
                                    other American Republics, including the United States; likewise
                                    that articles manufactured from rubber should be allocated to
                                    the American republics on the basis of the contribution to be
                                    realized thereby to the winning of the war. Argentina, which we
                                    understand has on hand a stockpile sufficient for 8 or 9 months’
                                    normal production for civilian needs in addition to supplies
                                    available for military needs, should not have the opportunity of
                                    amassing further stocks at the expense of the war effort.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The practical application of the foregoing means that it is absolutely
                            necessary for the United States to acquire from producing countries all
                            available crude rubber, including stocks on hand and rubber hereafter
                            produced. It also means that the producing countries must cooperate with
                            us in limiting internal consumption. Among measures which would achieve
                            these ends, aside from the sale of rubber to us, are the limitation of
                            exports (both of crude and manufactured rubber) to the United States,
                            limitation of rubber manufacture within the country, limitation of
                            rubber products in the country to uses essential to the conduct of the
                            war, and the prevention of hoarding.</p>
                        <p>These steps are a practical carrying out of Resolution II of the Rio
                                conference<note n="53" xml:id="d199fn53">For correspondence

                            republics and requiring positive action to that end. Any system under
                            which the United States is put in the position of competing as to price
                            with other American Republics for the acquisition of a commodity which
                            should be allocated on the basis of war or defense needs, aside from any
                            question of cost in dollars, will cause confusion in the negotiation of
                            contracts and may result in a failure to make available to the conduct
                            of the war the maximum amount of rubber and rubber products needed for
                            that purpose. If the United States, in order to acquire crude rubber in
                            the American republics, is required to negotiate from country to country
                            at varying prices, none of the producing countries will be satisfied.
                            There is no hesitation on the part of the United States in paying
                            amounts necessary to procure the rubber under an orderly method, and our
                            government is prepared to take into consideration all local features
                            affecting price.</p>

                        <p>The United States has carried out, and is continuing to carry out,
                            substantial and important plans for the development of resources and for
                            aiding in the maintenance of internal economies in the American
                            Republics. The allocations agreed upon and the priority treatment now
                            being accorded to the other American Republics with respect to many
                            tight products are relatively much less severe than the treatment
                            accorded to civilian users of the same products within the United
                            States. This Government expects that there will be a parallel
                            development in which the American republics will cooperate fully in all
                            measures designed to allocate to the various republics the maximum
                            amount of rubber products on the basis of respective war or defense
                            needs. Arrangements through barter or otherwise which obtain for a
                            particular country a disproportionate amount of rubber products will in
                            the end only deter the common cause.</p>

                                xml:id="d202fn57">Not printed; in this telegram Ambassador Lane
                                proposed that in his coming interview with the President of
                                Colombia, he concentrate on the proposed rubber agreement (810.20
                                Defense/2585).</note> The procedure suggested with respect to No. 2
                            is approved. The Department suggests that you make very clear to the
                            President the urgency of our Government’s obtaining Colombia’s
                            exportable rubber. Favorable arrangements along the lines of the offer
                            made to Colombia have now been entered into with Brazil, Peru and
                            Nicaragua, and an agreement in principle has been reached with Ecuador
                            and Costa Rica. The price in all these agreements has been based upon
                            the price agreed upon with Brazil of 39¢ f.o.b. Belém for Upriver Acre
                            Fine on a washed and dried basis with appropriate differentials for
                            other types and grades. The offer made to Colombia is for the quality
                            understood to be the most common in Colombia; any other types and grades
                            would be purchased at differentials based upon past usage. In addition
                            Rubber Reserve is prepared to expend up to $500,000 for increasing
                            amount and improving quality of wild rubber produced in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>It is contemplated that the agreement would provide for the export to
                            this country of all rubber not required for essential needs and that
                            essential needs would be determined on the basis of use of rubber
                            products in this country, and the amount needed would be specified. This
                            Government also desires to obtain from Colombia an agreement to sell to
                            us all exports of manufactured products. Both of these points are
                            considered very important here, and represent a practical carrying out
                            of Resolution II of the Rio conference. It is suggested that you explore
                            with the President the possibility of an embargo on rubber contracts and
                            rubber exports pending the negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>In connection with the foregoing, it is suggested that you review the
                            Department’s circular telegram of March 28, 9 p.m.</p>
                        <p>A form of contract is being prepared and will be transmitted shortly. It
                            is desirable, however, that there should be no delay in reaching an
                            agreement in principle.</p>

                        <p>521. Your 599, May 5, 7 p.m. United States tire companies have been
                            stimulating interest in rubber plants in practically all of the American
                            republics and complicating our entire rubber purchasing program thereby.
                            It is the Department’s preliminary view on very scant consideration of
                            your telegram that in general it would not be feasible to furnish the
                            equipment to Colombia for the establishment of a tire plant.
                            Nevertheless, the whole situation with reference to all the other
                            American republics is being surveyed by the Department, and you will be
                            instructed further during the course of the next few days.</p>

                        <p>617. Referring to Department’s 514, May 5, 8 p.m. I went over the rubber
                            situation in detail with Santos this afternoon and emphasized the great
                            importance which the United States Government attaches to it.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could not give me a final commitment as to the
                            best refiner price without discussing the matter with the Minister of
                            Economy. He hopes to inform the Department, however, that he accepts our
                            proposal in principle namely, to sell all surplus rubber and
                            manufactured rubber goods to the United States and to place an embargo
                            on rubber exports pending negotiations. He specifically stated that
                            under no condition would Colombia sell rubber output to any country
                            other than the United States.</p>
                        <p>He said that while the López<note n="58" xml:id="d204fn58">Alfonso López
                                was elected on May 3, 1942, to succeed Eduardo Santos as President
                                of Colombia; he took office on August 7.</note> Administration would
                            of course honor any commitments made by Santos government he felt that
                            as he <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0191"/>has only 3 months more in
                            office it would be only fair to the President-elect if I should discuss
                            the matter also with him. He said he would summon López at once and tell
                            him that he had agreed in principle to our proposal. I have an
                            appointment to see López Monday.<note n="59" xml:id="d204fn59">May

                            other American Republics producing wild rubber assuring to the United
                            States their entire production other than the amount required for
                            essential needs. Negotiations are nearing conclusion in a number of the

                            manufactured, is contracted for to us, and Brazil is accordingly unable

                            contractual arrangements, to deprive the other Republics of their

                                n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0192"/>considered unwise to postpone
                            negotiations pending the determination of the various essential wartime
                            requirements of the other republics and of the methods by which these
                            requirements might most efficiently be satisfied. Up-to-date information
                            has not been available here as to the extent to which methods of
                            manufacturing tires and tubes achieve as great a degree of conservation
                            of crude rubber as is the case here, where reclaiming and recapping
                            facilities are in use. The manufacture of a great number of rubber
                            products has been discontinued in this country and drastic measures for
                            the conservation of rubber have been instituted.</p>
                        <p>This Government is prepared to give assurances that, on the basis of the
                            foregoing factors and having in mind the great shortage of rubber, this
                            Government will endeavor repeat endeavor to satisfy the essential
                            wartime requirements for rubber products, including tires and tubes of
                            the country to which you are accredited.</p>
                        <p>The question of whether these requirements will be satisfied by shipment
                            from here or from Brazil or from some other manufacturing country will
                            not be determined by any motives of commercial gain in this country but
                            solely on the basis of efficiency from the point of view of availability
                            of shipping, potential risk of loss in shipping, and of the amount of
                            crude rubber consumed. It appears logical that a substantial part of
                            these requirements should be furnished from stocks contracted for by
                            this Government in Brazil. Existing Venezuelan manufacturing capacity
                            might best be used for supplying nearby countries. But in any event the
                            contractual rights obtained by this Government will not be used to deny
                            to the other Republics their essential requirements of rubber
                            products.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to bring the substance of the foregoing to the
                            attention of the proper officials of the government to which you are

                        <p>The Colombian Government is prepared to enter into an agreement with the
                            United States Government giving us the right to purchase all rubber in
                            excess of Colombian internal needs at a price to be based <pb n="179"

                            <item>Because of the dependence of Colombian economy on automobile
                                transportation and consequent necessity of maintaining adequate
                                supply of tires and tubes, the Colombian Government considers it
                                essential that automobile tire plant be constructed here to take
                                care of current needs. The Minister said that he had under
                                consideration offers from United States Rubber, Firestone, Goodrich,
                                and Goodyear. Colombian Government would assure us that no tires
                                would be exported from Colombia without prior consent on our
                                part.</item>

                                States and he reaffirmed the policy expressed to me by the President
                                that as this war is also Colombia’s war the Colombian Government
                                does not under any condition desire strategic materials to reach the
                                enemies of the United States.</item>

                                needs would be 1000 tons of rubber per annum there would still be
                                available at least 3000 tons of crude rubber for export to the
                                United States. (Our estimates for tires and tubes alone for
                                Colombian consumption are 600 tons of rubber per annum).</item>

                        <p>632. Your 698 of May 25.</p>
                        <p>1st. Rubber Reserve Company would prefer to have a fixed price for the
                            5-year period in order to encourage making investment in <pb n="180"
                                xml:id="pg_180" facs="0194"/>rubber production. The Brazilian and
                            Peruvian agreements provide for such change in the price at end of the
                            first 2 years as is mutually agreed upon as appropriate by reason of
                            changed circumstances affecting the world price of rubber. Such a
                            provision in the Colombian agreement would be satisfactory, but a fixed
                            price for the 5 year period is preferred. There are real advantages to
                            Colombia in having the price fixed for 5 years; if, for instance the war
                            should end in 2 years, Colombia would nevertheless have a market for its
                            rubber at this price regardless of what other sources of rubber should
                            then be available, such as Far Eastern or synthetic rubber. However,
                            Rubber Reserve would not be inclined to take a firm stand on the point
                            if it is considered important by the Colombian Government.</p>
                        <p>2d. While under ordinary circumstances this Government would consider
                            with the greatest sympathy the construction of a tire plant in Colombia,
                            such a project is impossible at the present time. In many of the
                            American republics such projects have been put forward and the policy of
                            the Department has been uniformly against them except in the case of
                            Peru where special considerations were believed to exist. In spite of
                            the fact that it is stated by proponents of these plants that
                            second-hand machinery will be used, investigation reveals that some new
                            equipment is generally required which is of the tightest priority.
                            Moreover, it is difficult if not impossible to be assured that such
                            plants will be as efficient in limiting the amount of crude rubber used
                            in manufacture or in adopting other conservation methods as is the case
                            here.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean that there is any failure to recognize the
                            desirability of saving shipping space and risks involved in the delivery
                            of crude rubber to this country and sending tires back to the producing
                            country, or to recognize the necessity for satisfying Colombia’s
                            essential requirements for rubber products. The Department’s circular
                            telegram of May 18 sets forth this Government’s attitude in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>The Department is engaged in obtaining complete information on rubber
                            manufacturing capacity in Central and South America. Until and unless
                            this investigation establishes that there now exists insufficient
                            capacity for supplying essential requirements in these countries, and
                            taking into consideration the factors referred to above, the Department
                            will not favor any additional construction or expansion of existing
                            facilities in Central or South America. It is repeated, that this
                            Government will, however, endeavor to satisfy Colombia’s indispensable
                            requirements for rubber products.</p>
                        <p>3d. The information available here indicates that Colombia’s
                            indispensable requirements are between 500 to 1,000 tons per annum. <pb
                                n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0195"/>You are authorized to agree on
                            any amount between these two figures which appears to you to be
                            reasonable having in mind your estimate of 600 tons for tires and tubes
                            and the fact that presumably Colombian requirements for miscellaneous
                            products should be small.</p>
                        <p>4th. A price of 33 cents for castilloa was offered to Colombia as
                            compared with the price of 24 cents agreed on with Brazil. In order to
                            equalize the situation, Brazil has been offered and has accepted an
                            increase in all prices, both for castilloa and hevea, of approximately
                            15 percent, 7½ percent to be passed on to the producers and 7½ Percent
                            to be retained by the Instituto Agronomico do Norte, such increase to be
                            effective for the first 2 years of the contract. Accordingly, while no
                            increase in the price for Colombian castilloa is in order, Rubber
                            Reserve will agree to pay Colombia, for the first 2 years of the
                            contract, 39 cents plus approximately 15 percent for the equivalent of
                            Upriver Acre Fine, on a washed and dried basis, with appropriate
                            differentials for other types and grades. The exact increased price
                            agreed on with Brazil is not yet known here. You will be advised when it
                            is available, and in the meantime you may discuss it on the basis of a
                            15 percent increase over the 39 cents price.</p>
                        <p>A draft agreement is going forward by airmail.</p>

                                    is the most stable market for rubber; also for political reasons

                                    construction of a tire plant would prefer this arrangement for
                                    production of tires for they are absolutely essential for
                                    maintenance of national economy. Colombian Government has

                                    regarding reclamation of rubber. Colombia has until now refused
                                    to supply rubber to Venezuela and Argentina for manufacture of
                                    tires and will continue to do so unless unable to obtain tires

                            Government does not insist on immediate installation of tire plant fully
                            appreciating that because of shipping crisis it is not possible for us
                            to grant priority for machinery at this moment. The Colombian Government
                            would, however, like to have an assurance that once the crisis is
                            alleviated we will assist in establishing a plant which is necessary for
                            Colombian economy on a long range basis. Both the President and the
                            Minister of National Economy emphasized that severe restrictions
                            regarding the rise of rubber have been in force here for 2 months and
                            that we will be guaranteed that output of plant would be only for
                            Colombian essential needs. President and Minister also confirmed that
                            embargo is now in effect prohibiting the exportation of rubber to any
                            party other than the United States Government pending the conclusion of
                            present negotiations.</p>
                        <p>As the President indicated that he is not familiar with the technical
                            details regarding prices I shall discuss Department’s No. 653 with the
                            Minister of National Economy early next week.</p>

                                determined by price agreed between Brazil and the United States. No

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a draft of
                                agreement<note n="65" xml:id="d213fn65">Not attached to file
                                copy.</note> between Rubber Reserve Company and the Republic of
                            Colombia providing for the purchase by Rubber Reserve Company of the
                            exportable surplus of wild rubber produced in Colombia. The agreement
                            has been drafted on the basis of the telegrams recently exchanged
                            between the Embassy and the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that under paragraph 6 of the agreement a development
                            fund of $500,000 is to be expended by Rubber Reserve Company. Promptly
                            upon the execution of an agreement, Rubber Reserve Company plans to
                            establish an agency in Colombia in order to correlate all plans of this
                            Government with respect to rubber development work in Colombia. Such
                            agency would, of course, operate under the supervision of the Embassy
                            and only to the extent approved by the Government of Colombia. This
                            agency would be under an administrative head, would furnish all
                            necessary technical and advisory assistance, and would make and carry
                            out all necessary arrangements relating to the purchase of rubber by
                            Rubber Reserve Company.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that certain provisions of the contract are given in
                            general terms. In other countries it has been found desirable to
                            commence operations on this basis and to work out the details as the
                            matter proceeds. The organization which it is planned to send to
                            Colombia <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0199"/>will be prepared to
                            discuss and decide these matters, which include the price differentials
                            to be paid for various grades of rubber.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 3 of the draft agreement provides for the fixing of an amount
                            as sufficient to satisfy the essential requirements of Colombia for
                            rubber products. On the basis of information available here, it appears
                            that this amount should be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 tons per
                            annum, and you are requested to determine the amount within these limits
                            which you would consider reasonable. It will be noted that the agreement
                            contemplates an increase in this amount for justifiable causes.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the price fixed for rubber of the equivalent of
                            Upriver Acre Fine runs for the term of the contract rather than being
                            limited to the first 2 years of the contract as stated in the
                            Department’s telegram no. 632 of May 30, 1942. It is believed desirable
                            to have the price for both this type and for castilloa scrap in effect
                            for the same period of time.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the Ambassador request the appropriate officials of
                            the Colombian Government to limit to the United States the export of
                            crude rubber and rubber products pending the signature of the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>It is also suggested that when an agreement on the form has been reached,
                            the contract be signed by the Republic of Colombia and forwarded to the
                            Colombian Embassy here for delivery to the Department to obtain the
                            signature of Rubber Reserve Company. At that time notes will be
                            exchanged here between the Department and the Colombian Embassy
                            concerning the execution of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                            <item>Provision that price shall be effective for 5 years is
                                satisfactory; accordingly strike last sentence of Article 4 in draft
                                forwarded. Price for equivalent of Upriver Acre Fine to be inserted
                                in Article 4 has now been fixed at 45 cents. Brazil is being paid 39
                                cents, plus approximately 15%, half of which goes to Government to
                                be used in development work and half to producers. Rubber Reserve
                                prefers in Colombia to have entire price of 45 cents go to
                                producers. Price for Castilloa rubber to be paid Colombia is
                                substantially higher than Brazilian price; it is assumed Colombia
                                will have no objection.</item>

                            <item>In principle there is every desire to meet Colombia’s wish for a
                                tire plant. However, in addition to the shipping factor mentioned by
                                you, there is problem of obtaining priority for any new machinery
                                required, and, as pointed out in Department’s telegram 632 of May
                                30, it generally turns out that some new machinery of the highest
                                priority is required. Preliminary studies indicate Colombia’s
                                requirements can be furnished from Venezuela using existing capacity
                                and shipped overland. It is hoped that execution of the rubber
                                agreement does not have to wait a final answer to this
                                question.</item>

                            <item>This Government is most anxious to provide for every expenditure
                                reasonably designed to increase rubber production. However, it is
                                impossible to give blanket approval to any specific project without
                                further information. This question can best be handled by the Rubber
                                Reserve representatives planning to go to Colombia after signature
                                of the agreement.</item>

                            <item>This is another aspect of the problem of supplying Colombia’s
                                indispensable requirements for rubber products. A study will be
                                begun immediately as to its feasibility, but it is trusted that
                                execution of the agreement will not be delayed.</item>

                        <p>794. Department’s 678, June 12, 7 p.m. I informed the President today
                            that draft agreement for purchase of Colombian rubber had been received
                            this afternoon (Department’s instruction no. 135, June 9) and that I
                            propose subject to the approval of the President to discuss it tomorrow
                            in detail with the Minister of National Economy.</p>
                        <p>The President frankly said that while he wishes to cooperate with us in
                            every way in this and other matters in relation to the war, he was not
                            familiar with rubber situation and would therefore prefer that I conduct
                            negotiations with the Minister.</p>

                            draft agreement dated June 5, 1942 between Rubber Reserve and Republic
                            of Colombia.</p>

                            <item>Colombian Government has received an offer from an Argentine for
                                50 tons of Castilloa rubber, ex-Buenaventura at 50 cents per pound
                                to be returned equal tonnage manufactured tires. In accordance with
                                previous oral agreement with me Colombian Government will not make
                                any deal on this matter pending outcome of our negotiations but he
                                admitted difficulty of explaining satisfactorily to Congress his
                                concluding agreement with us at a price lower than Argentine
                                offer.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>As to paragraph 3 of draft agreement it is proposed that amount of
                                rubber for domestic use or consumption be fixed at minimum 1,000
                                tons a year 60 percent reserved for tires. Amount of crude rubber
                                corresponding to this reserve of 60 percent would be released for
                                export to the United States from Colombia’s maximum internal
                                requirements in the event that we would furnish them this tonnage in
                                tires. Colombian Government will not require construction of a tire
                                plant for one year or one year and a half provided that it can
                                obtain tires from Venezuela or Argentina in the meantime. It
                                requires 20,000 tires at once and 30,000 more within a year. Can we
                                guarantee that amount to Colombia?</item>

                                would prefer that minimum prices should be studied and adjusted
                                after 2 years from the date of agreement.</item>

                            <item>Colombian Government hopes that development fund may be increased
                                from 500,000 to 750,000 dollars so as to provide for construction of
                                roads and acquisition of launches in connection with rubber

                                sending me memorandum in reply to draft agreement it is agreed that
                                we shall continue negotiations orally with Arango so as to save
                                time. Arango said that he will be leaving office shortly and would
                                like to conclude negotiations and sign agreement within a week. He
                                concluded interview with assurance that if we would guarantee supply
                                of tires required pending construction of a tire plant, contract
                                could be signed at once.</item>

                            <item>It should of course be remembered that Rubber Reserve’s commitment
                                is for a 5-year period. This assurance of a long term market should
                                easily counter-balance a 50-cent price for 50 tons. In addition so
                                far as known nothing comparable to the fund being provided by Rubber
                                Reserve is being offered by Argentina.</item>

                                commitment on part of this Government to see that tire plant is made

                                outlined in Department’s 678 of June 12. Guarantee can be given of
                                prompt delivery of 20,000 tires and of 30,000 more within a year,

                        <p>5. My telegram number 122 [<hi rend="italic">722</hi>], December 25, 6
                                a.m.<note n="76" xml:id="d221fn76">Not printed; in this telegram Mr.
                                Braden reported he had recently discussed with Foreign Minister
                                López de Mesa and President Santos the importance of putting the
                                Italian tankers immobilized by Colombia into service
                                (800.85/512).</note> On December 31, Tropical Oil Company
                            representative received instruction stating that his company was
                            authorized by the United States Maritime Commission, subject to my
                            approval, to negotiate directly with Colombian Government for purchase
                            or charter of two Italian tankers. I recommended his taking the matter
                            up with the Foreign Office. He did this morning and was advised that
                            Colombia could not negotiate because it was already committed to
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon President Santos stated to me that he was annoyed by the
                            delay in this matter and had instructed the Minister of Foreign
                            Relations with all courtesy to terminate negotiations elsewhere, to
                            prepare a decree unilaterally taking ownership of the vessels that we
                            had discussed (and to turn them over to us at cost).</p>
                        <p>I therefore hope that so soon as the holidays are over we can obtain
                            definite action on this matter.</p>

                        <p>33. My telegram No. 5 of January 2, 11 p.m. President Santos yesterday
                            afternoon informed me that negotiations with Argentina regarding tankers
                            have been terminated and Colombia is now ready to take ownership and to
                            transfer immediately to us.</p>
                        <p>He suggests that price to be paid be left to arbitration between Colombia
                            and Italy after war and that we then reimburse Colombia without profit
                            to this country.</p>
                        <p>In response to President’s inquiry, and in view of Department’s circular
                            telegram of January 3, 10 p.m.,<note n="77" xml:id="d222fn77">Not
                                printed.</note>I said I assumed we were anxious to get possession of

                        <p>We will, of course, have to supply crews to remove the vessels from
                            Cartagena.</p>
                        <p>President is particularly anxious as part of this deal to obtain two
                            merchant ships. I expressed great doubt this could be done for a
                            considerable time; certainly not until our shipbuilding program reached
                            a point where all war requirements were cared for. He said he understood
                            this thoroughly but hoped it could be worked out in order to insure
                            transportation of cargoes to and from Colombia during the war.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Relations is formally to confirm the foregoing to
                            me tomorrow morning. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving telegraphic

                        <p>38. My telegram No. 33 January 9,3 a.m. … Minister of Foreign Relations
                            this morning after lengthy explanation placing blame for delays so far
                            on Argentina said Italians asked $2,850,000 for two tankers or
                            approximately 2 million dollars more than our evaluation, a sum which
                            Colombia could not afford and he therefore requested us to make an offer
                            for the vessels, including therein delivery to Colombia of either one
                            large (up to 8000 tons) or two small (about 4000 tons each) merchant
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>I pointed to discrepancy between his proposal and that of President
                            Santos in that latter had suggested arbitration of price after the war
                            and our taking possession of tankers immediately without making delivery
                            of merchant vessels by us a condition but merely a facility which the
                            President earnestly hoped we could give when possible.</p>
                        <p>The Minister argued that arbitration in any case would be an ultimate
                            measure and Colombia had learned from sad experience that a small
                            country always lost in arbitration with a large one. I replied that this
                            objection could be eliminated by the United States as a party in
                            interest joining Colombia in the arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The Minister had no further comeback excepting to say Italy would be
                            enraged by Colombia’s action and in fact already Colombian Minister in
                            Rome was being discriminated against by being confined to the Legation
                            whereas Mexican and other American diplomats were at liberty. Moreover
                            he said Colombian merchants and industrialists are so alarmed at
                            possibility of not being able to make shipments <pb n="195"
                                xml:id="pg_195" facs="0209"/>that the Government would have to
                            satisfy them by at least demonstrating every effort had been made to
                            obtain merchant vessels.</p>
                        <p>Since Santos of course has the final decision I recommend any proposal
                            the Department may care to make be based on his statement to me and if
                            at all feasible include as definite a proposal as possible looking to
                            the delivery of one or two merchant vessels.</p>

                            Italian tankers and deliver them to the Commission which in turn agrees
                            to full and just compensation for the Italians in accordance with the
                            principles of international law.</p>
                        <p>The Commission is unwilling to agree to the suggestion of arbitration.
                            There is no objection either on the part of the Department or the
                            Commission to Standard Oil’s negotiating with the Colombian Government
                            for these tankers. It is not yet definitely known whether the Commission
                            will be able to make available any cargo vessels for Colombia. It is
                            therefore suggested that you do not go beyond your previous statements
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>If you perceive objection to replying to Colombians in this sense please
                            report to the Department together with such recommendations as you may
                            have in the premises.</p>

                        <p>183. Department’s telegram 159, February 10, 7 p.m. The President this
                            afternoon confirmed information given to me by Turbay that sale of
                            tankers should be handled in the Shipping Subcommittee of the
                            Inter-American Economic Advisory Committee. He frankly stated that his
                            principal object was as soon as possible to make delivery of the vessels
                            to the United States and in return to get the best possible assurances
                            that this country’s shipping needs would be cared for either by
                            allocation of sufficient tonnage to Colombian trade or by purchase of
                            one or two merchant vessels. …</p>
                        <p>He does not know to whom in the United States or under what terms the
                            tankers should be turned over; therefore, these are matters which can
                            best be worked out with Turbay. The same applies to the nature of the
                            statement to be made by the Maritime Commission. In my opinion it would
                            strengthen Santos’ hand were it possible to make a stronger statement
                            than that suggested in the Department’s telegram under reference.</p>

                        <p>356. Referring to the Embassy’s No. 33, January 9, 3 a.m. Foreign
                            Minister remarked to me yesterday that the question of the Italian
                            tankers was causing him a great deal of anxiety. He again expressed a
                            lack of confidence in arbitration after the war reiterating that his
                            experience had shown that a small country often stood to lose in
                            arbitral proceedings with a large country. He also felt that Italy was
                            perhaps trying to handicap the transaction by claiming such a high price
                            for the tankers which I agreed was most likely.</p>
                        <p>I assured him my Government would be glad if the matter might be settled
                            soon and he said he would at once discuss it further with President
                            Santos. He promised to keep me informed although negotiations are now
                            being handled in Washington.</p>

                        <p>311. Your 356, March 13. A proposal for the purchase of the two Italian
                            tankers has been submitted to the Colombian Ambassador. It is
                            substantially as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>A payment of $1,500,000 for the two tankers. Although it was
                                    originally proposed that extraordinary repairs would be
                                    deductible from this total, the proposal now stands that no such
                                    provision will be included if the tankers are in approximately
                                    the same shape as they were when the survey by Standard Oil was
                                    made. Colombia must take title first, however.</item>

                        <p>570. Reference to Department’s telegram 484. The Foreign Minister
                            informed me this morning that Colombian Government had offered to
                            Phyllis [?] the sum of 1,500,000 for the two tankers but this was not
                            accepted as latter insists on price of $250 per ton for the <hi
                                rend="italic">Anteo</hi> and $200 per ton for the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Rapallo</hi>. Subsequently no action has been taken and Turbay has
                            received no instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Minister fears that if they take over the tankers on the basis of our
                            offer Italy will claim the difference between our price and its own
                            which will have to be settled by arbitration at the end of the war. He
                            requested I “sound out” whether our Government would be ready to
                            guarantee that, if as a result of arbitration following the war Italy
                            were awarded a sum greater than that now offered, the United States
                            Government would assume the responsibility of paying the difference. He
                            said this would help him on presenting the matter again to the Council
                            of Ministers. He remarked that it would be assuming a considerable risk
                            to place the Government open to claims after the war for “15 minutes use
                            of the two boats” (it is not possible to dissuade him from an apparent
                            conviction that if Colombia takes the boats there will be a special
                            effort made to sink them immediately).</p>
                        <p>He then told me Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were all interested in
                            obtaining these ships and that he was convinced that Argentina would pay
                            the amount Italy was demanding although he added that possibly the
                            former would be able to obtain a rebate from Italy after that step were
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>My reaction is that it is not actually a lack of the Minister’s desire to
                            cooperate but rather an unwarranted caution to prevent the Government’s
                                <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0213"/>being caught for a large
                            sum as a result of future arbitration. Following the presidential
                            elections May 3 the solution here will probably best result from
                            conversations with the President on this subject, with reminders being
                            given to Turbay by the Department as to the urgency of the matter.</p>

                            arbitral tribunal the United States would guarantee to reimburse
                            Colombia for this amount. I informed the President that I would transmit
                            his suggestion to the Department. As Colombian Government is now
                            complying unreservedly with our wishes despite pressure from the
                            Argentine Government and the Chilean Government which Santos said was at

                            and that funds received in payment would be deposited in a Colombian
                            bank until after the war. He urges that the United States officials who
                            are to take over the ships arrive at Cartagena at the earliest possible
                            and confidentially so as to minimize possibility of sabotage. Please

                        <p>582. Your 618, May 8, midnight, and 570, April 29, 8 p.m. The proposal
                            contained in the Department’s 311 of March 14 was designed to avoid the
                            question of arbitration between Colombia and Italy regarding the price
                            to be paid for these tankers. This was carefully explained to the
                            Colombian Ambassador here. The Maritime Commission does not consider it
                            advisable to have the price to be paid for the tankers determined in
                            this manner. It suggests, however, if the Government of Colombia is
                            willing to turn the vessels over to the United States, that the latter
                            would pay the Italians a price similar to that which it is obliged to
                            pay when it requisitions vessels under our law.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped, however, that you can obtain acceptance of our proposal
                            referred to above without further recourse to the matter of
                            arbitration.</p>

                        <p>688. Department’s 582, May 18, 11 p.m. The President told me during past
                            week Italian Government, with a view to preventing sale of tankers to
                            the United States, had stiffened its terms for the two tankers:
                            $4,000,000 payable in gold coins—that is $6,800,000; and Italy to have
                            the right to re-purchase vessels after the war. The President said that
                            these terms are unreasonable.</p>
                        <p>On my persuading the President we are as anxious as Colombia to avoid
                            litigation as a result of Colombia’s good offices and that we are <pb
                                n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0215"/>prepared to pay Italians a
                            price in accordance with requisitioning of vessels under the laws of
                            United States, he agreed not to insist on his former point provided we
                            would assume responsibility for consequences.</p>
                        <p>By this he meant, he said, not that we should guarantee any sum to the
                            Colombian Government but that we should consider it our moral
                            responsibility to relieve Colombia from any consequences which might
                            ensue as a result of Colombian action.</p>
                        <p>When I suggested that, as in the case of our general military problems
                            (see my telegram 687, May 22, 7 p.m.<note n="83" xml:id="d235fn83">

                            exist along the lines suggested by him, he agreed and said that he would
                            immediately instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs to issue a decree
                            to permit sale of two tankers to the United States Government, on our
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>While I admit that this informal agreement regarding our moral
                            responsibility may be too general to be entirely satisfactory to the
                            Department, I believe it is the best arrangement we can now make and
                            therefore, I recommend its acceptance because of the urgency of the
                            matter.</p>

                            hoped to keep these tankers in inter-American trade it is impossible
                            under wartime conditions to give any firm assurances to this effect; (2)
                            Colombian registry raises the practical problem of the availability of
                            skilled personnel; your comments on other problems involved in operating
                            under Colombian registry would be appreciated; (3) The War Shipping
                            Administration is assuming certain responsibility with respect to these
                            tankers and it believes that it should have freedom of action as to
                            their use if at all possible.</p>

                        <p>The administration has been unable to locate the firm mentioned in your
                            telegram and is inclined to believe it may be an effort on the part of
                            Argentina to secure the vessels.</p>

                                printed.</note> The President sent for me today to inquire whether I
                            had any reply from the Department as to when the crews of the two
                            tankers may be expected. I was obliged to reply in the negative.</p>
                        <p>The President said that his assurances of the past are still binding but
                            that as he would prefer the transaction not to be between the two
                            Governments he suggests that the transfer be made from the Federación
                            Nacional de Cafeteros, acting as trustee, to the United States Maritime
                            Commission. He is prepared to suggest the transaction at any time
                            agreeable the United States Government. (Exchange of notes mentioned in
                            the Department’s 524 May 6, 10 p.m. has never been received by this
                            Embassy.) The President again emphasized desire to turn over the tankers
                            without any publicity being attached until they have left Colombian
                            waters. For this reason he emphasizes the necessity for keeping the
                            matter including the arrival of the crews extremely secret.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate Department’s urgent instructions as to whether form
                            of transfer satisfactory and when crews may be expected.</p>

                            transfer the War Shipping Administration prefers that the transfer be
                            made directly from the Colombian Government to the United States
                            represented by the War Shipping Administrator. If determination to make
                            transfer on these terms is final, War Shipping Administration is
                            prepared to send crews as soon as it can arrange transportation by
                            air.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Salazar made his excuses for his long silence since his visit of

                            had not been idle during this time. He had reported that conversation by
                            a long cable and subsequently had much correspondence with the Mortgage
                            Bank concerning the suggestions developed in that conversation. The Bank
                            and the Ministry of Finance had made a thorough study of the Bank’s
                            condition and had decided that its income was not sufficient to permit
                            it to pay the interest and amortization on the lines then suggested,
                            viz., comparable for the guaranteed bonds with the settlement made of
                            the Colombian National Bonds and, in the case of the non-guaranteed
                            bonds, comparable with the payments made of the sterling bonds.</p>
                        <p>There had been much consultation at Bogotá and by exchange of letters
                            with him. Unhappily these had not resulted in any new proposals.
                            However, the suggestion has come up that the Colombian Government could
                            issue National Bonds, that is, three percent dollar bonds of the same
                            type recently offered in the settlement of the dollar bonds of the
                            Government of Colombia and offer these in exchange for the dollar bonds
                            of the Colombian Agricultural Mortgage Bank. Dr. Salazar had not been
                            informed of the terms on which this exchange would be made. He had been
                            asked, however, to consult his friends in the Department of State as to
                            (1) whether objection was seen to this method of settlement, and (2)
                            whether it could legally be done from the point of view of laws of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0220"/>
                        <p>In discussion Dr. Salazar insisted that he had not been informed as to
                            the terms on which National Bonds might be offered the holders of the
                            Bank’s bonds. He thought it might be in mind to offer less favorable
                            treatment of arrears of interest than had been given the holders of
                            National Bonds in the recent settlement. This was with reference to
                            guaranteed bonds. For the non-guaranteed bonds he thought that the
                            holders might be offered a reduced capital amount. But on these points
                            he had not been informed. All he was to do was to ask questions as to
                            how this means of settlement was regarded in principle and as to any
                            legal difficulties which could be foreseen.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of personal opinions he was told that no objection in
                            principle was perceived to a type of settlement in which the Colombian
                            Government would offer to exchange dollar bonds of its own for dollar
                            bonds of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank. The idea might even be regarded
                            as a favorable point of departure. On the legal side it was not
                            perceived that there was any difficulty, although the offer of a
                            settlement of this kind would, of course, have to be registered with the
                            Securities and Exchange Commission in conformity with whatever
                            requirements the Commission may establish, which would probably call for
                            full information regarding Colombian finances and regarding the finances
                            of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested that on the legal question he might also want to speak
                            to trustees of the Bank’s bonds and to the Fiscal Agent of the National
                            Loan. Mention was also made that American counsel who have been retained
                            in the recent adjustment of the Colombian National Bonds must be highly
                            qualified in such matters as S. E. C.<note n="91" xml:id="d243fn91"
                                >Securities and Exchange Commission.</note> procedures, etc., and
                            fully familiar with the question of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank
                            bonds. Dr. Salazar indicated that part of the procedure might be for the
                            Mortgage Bank to sell internal <hi rend="italic">cédulas</hi> and pay
                            the proceeds to the Government for assuming the Bank’s foreign debt. He
                            did not define just what advantages would be derived from this but
                            evidently from the Colombian point of view it is regarded as one of the
                            attractive elements in the procedure.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar expects to return to Colombia early in February and has long
                            since asked the Bank to name his successor. He has never received a
                            reply on this point. He said that if the procedure of the Government
                            taking over the debt is followed, the negotiations might possibly be
                            entrusted to the Embassy, although Colombia had no one here highly
                            qualified to handle such a matter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar said that he would at once telegraph Bogotá the expressions
                            of personal opinions which he had been given. He made it very clear that
                            he understood that these conversations were not direct <pb n="207"
                                xml:id="pg_207" facs="0221"/>negotiations between two parties but
                            that the State Department was merely offering its friendly assistance
                            and good offices in his mission here.</p>
                        <p>He said that he would urge Bogotá to send him a detailed proposal with
                            which he could again approach the Department of State. However, … he
                            hardly expected that he would receive a new proposal before he leaves
                            for Bogotá.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Salazar came down from New York to report developments since his
                            visit of January 15, 1942. He said that immediately after that
                            conversation he telegraphed a report to the Bank. He received a reply
                            jointly signed by the Colombian Minister of Finance<note n="92"
                                xml:id="d244fn92">Carlos Lleras Restrepo.</note> and the Bank. They
                            stated that after very full consideration of the matter they found that
                            it would not be possible to make a proposal which would provide any
                            payment in respect of arrears of interest on the Bank’s bonds. They did,
                            however, regard a settlement which would give the bondholders bonds of
                            the National Government of Colombia as very favorable to the bondholders
                            in giving them a readily marketable security bearing the name of the
                            Government of Colombia and no longer tied to the vicissitudes of the
                            fortunes of the Bank, which, Dr. Salazar observed, might possibly again
                            run into serious difficulties at the end of the world war. Dr. Salazar
                            explained that the instructions he had first received from Bogotá were
                            to offer 70 per cent of the capital amount of the outstanding bonds in
                            new bonds bearing 2½ per cent interest. However, the Colombian
                                Ambassador<note n="93" xml:id="d244fn93">Gabriel Turbay.</note> and
                            he had insisted that a proposal involving the reduction of capital
                            should not be submitted to the Department of State. He was then
                            authorized to offer par for par of 2½ per cent bonds. The present
                            proposal was par for par of 3 per cent bonds and these bonds had <pb
                                n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0222"/>the added advantage of being an
                            issue established in the American market. Thus Colombia had yielded on
                            three points. The Bank considered that its fiscal position was such as
                            to preclude its yielding further and proposing payments in respect of
                            arrears of interests. (All this related to the guaranteed bonds.)</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar said that his new instructions authorized him to submit these
                            considerations to the Department of State and to say that if the
                            Department indicated no adverse opinion and he so reported to Bogotá, he
                            might be authorized to submit a formal proposal before he leaves for
                            Bogotá on February 4.</p>
                        <p>In discussion, Mr. Walmsley asked whether Dr. Salazar had received any
                            further information regarding the Bank’s holdings of its own bonds,
                            regarding which inquiry had been made in an earlier interview with Dr.
                            Salazar. Dr. Salazar said that although he had asked for it several
                            times he had not received this information, but that he had been told
                            that it could be furnished the Department if and when a formal proposal
                            was made to the Department. In reply it was suggested that to carry out
                            the new proposal would probably require the filing of a registration
                            statement with SEC, submitting all material facts respecting the Bank’s
                            position, the number of its own bonds in its possession, the estimated
                            number owned by Americans, and all other pertinent data regarding the
                            Bank’s position. (Possibly registration could be avoided if a bank would
                            handle the exchange and charge only for the costs of handling the
                            papers.) The Department has no way of knowing what showing would be made
                            in the registration statement in response to the inquiries SEC would
                            undoubtedly make on such points. It would be very difficult for the
                            Department to take any favorable attitude toward an adjustment proposal
                            in the absence of information such as SEC would require, which might
                            have a very important bearing on the public reception given any
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that a settlement already made on the Government’s own
                            bonds would be self-explanatory, and would minimize adverse comment.
                            Anything less than this would invite adverse comment and be difficult
                            for the Department to defend.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar said that he recognized this but that the Bank’s position was
                            as he had stated. He referred to the fact that direct appropriation by
                            the Government would be a matter requiring congressional action and
                            would thus be dragged into public debate. As a practical matter,
                            therefore, the settlement had to be within the Bank’s and executive
                            branch’s power of accomplishment without recourse to congress.</p>
                        <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar inquired about further procedure. Should further action await
                            his return to Bogotá, where he proposes to continue his interest in the
                            matter? There was discussion as to whether the Department might not
                            telegraph Ambassador Braden a report of the status of the matter with a
                            view to his discussing it on a personal basis with the Minister of
                            Finance. Dr. Salazar said that he did not know whether the Minister
                            would be prepared to appear in the matter in this form, although he is
                            also a director of the Bank and is interested in the matter in that
                            capacity. He suggested that the initiative as to any discussions with
                            the Ambassador should be left to the Minister of Finance, and said that
                            he would immediately cable the Minister. If he finds the Minister
                            favorably disposed to such conversations he will advise the Department
                            of State would [<hi rend="italic">which?</hi>] could instruct the

                            Agricultural Mortgage Bank. Since Dr. Salazar felt that the initiative

                            Ambassador, no discussion should be undertaken without the previous

                            can be promptly settled on the basis of liquidation over 15 years which
                            I understand is satisfactory to all group participants excepting Bank of
                            Manhattan Company and Continental Illinois Bank of Chicago who demand a
                            10-year period.</p>
                        <p>The Colombian Government is strongly opposed to anything less than 15
                            years as too heavy burden on the budget. Failure to reach an agreement
                            under the existing special authorization granted by Congress will carry
                            it into succeeding administration thus probably entailing its being
                            debated in Congress which in turn might mean the deferment of a
                            settlement for several years. In my opinion, the two aforementioned
                            institutions will better protect their interests by acceding to

                                xml:id="d247fn96">W. W. Lancaster, Counsel for National City Bank,
                                New York City.</note> has called me twice with respect to the latest
                            developments in the attitude which the New York and Chicago banking
                            group wishes to take with respect to extension of the Colombian banking
                            debt matter. You will recall that last December the debt was extended
                            for six months on the old terms, and that the Colombian Government has
                            authority to enter into a definitive agreement provided the period of
                            amortization is not less than ten years. It is obviously desirable to
                            settle this matter prior to the expiration of the present extension
                            about the first of June.</p>
                        <p>The debt amounts to about $15,000,000; interest has been paid at three
                            percent. Ambassador Braden has been suggesting a fifteen year
                            amortization period, while the Colombian Government has been talking in
                            terms of eighteen years. The banking group had not wished to exceed
                            twelve to twelve and one-half years.</p>
                        <p>Annual payments of amortization and interest over a fifteen year period
                            would amount to $1, 199,000; over eighteen years to $1,040,000. Mr.
                            Lancaster states that the United States banking group would be willing
                            to accept annual payments on the basis of the fifteen year period—that
                            is $1, 199,000 per year, the entire arrangement to mature <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0225"/>in about twelve and one-half years
                            leaving a final payment—known in banking circles as a balloon—of between
                            $2,000,000 and $3,000,000. In order to insure flexibility the banking
                            group would be prepared to accept $1,000,000 during the first years to
                            be stepped up to something over $1,200,000 in the final years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lancaster asks that if this proposal commends itself to the
                            Department you advise him on how to proceed. He would be very happy if
                            you would discuss the matter with Ambassador Turbay.<note n="97"
                                xml:id="d247fn97">In an appended note, dated March 2, to Mr.
                                Collado, the Under Secretary stated: “I suggest that you speak
                                entirely informally with the Colombian Ambassador yourself. You may
                                say that you are doing so at my request.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In my opinion the proposal made by Mr. Lancaster is not a bad one.
                            Colombia has wished to pay only $1,000,000 a year, but I believe that
                            Colombia is interested primarily in the present and not in the long run,
                            and that it would agree to the banking terms. Undoubtedly when the end
                            of the twelve and one-half year period approached, Colombia would then
                            renegotiate with the bankers to extend the period for the final
                            payments. I believe that it would not be inappropriate to indicate
                            informally to the Ambassador the views of the banking group and suggest
                            that he take them up with Bogotá. I do not believe that the Department
                            of State should take a formal position in the matter, but it might
                            informally facilitate discussions which will undoubtedly be somewhat
                            protracted, and consequently should begin at once to meet the June 1st
                            deadline.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lancaster will telephone again on Monday<note n="98"

                            year period and that he would continue to do so. He asked whether the
                            proposal could not be changed to a straight fifteen year basis with the
                            debt to be paid in the earlier years of the period or, alternatively,
                            following the precedent set in some Export-Import Bank transactions, the
                            balloon might be paid off during an additional two and one-half or three
                            years providing all other payments had been met when due during the
                            twelve and one-half year term. The Ambassador stated that if the banking
                            group was prepared to accept either of these proposals, he would
                            personally write to the President of the Republic and the Finance
                            Minister urging immediate settlement of the matter.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned Mr. Lancaster regarding this the following day and he stated
                            that he had received a message from the National City Bank manager in
                            Bogotá stating that the Finance Minister had made the following
                            proposal:</p>
                        <p>The debt would be settled on a ten-year basis with payments as follows:

                        <p>The Ambassador said that on his recent visit to Bogotá he had inquired
                            very carefully into the Agricultural Mortgage Bank bond situation. He
                            had seen all Mr. Salazar’s correspondence concerning his conversations
                            with the Department of State from last October through January. He had
                            discussed the matter with the Government and with the officers and Board
                            of Directors of the Bank. He had been asked, in view of his past work on
                            the adjustment of the Colombian National Bonds, to carry on with the
                            conversations which Mr. Salazar had begun. He was not charged to
                            negotiate a settlement. His position was the same as that of the others
                            present, namely that of an intermediary helping to bring about an
                            adjustment between the debtor and the creditors.</p>
                        <p>At Bogotá he had said that he could not do anything with the matter
                            unless he knew the facts with which he was dealing. Before he could say
                            that a proposal was good, he would have to be sure that it was good. He
                            had therefore obtained a balance sheet of the Mortgage Bank, which
                            showed both the published figures and the real figures. He handed a copy
                            of this to Mr. Livesey.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Livesey said that the Department had been very anxious to have this
                            information. Looking at the memorandum handed him by the Ambassador, he
                            found on page two the breakdown of the assets item entitled “Valores
                            Diversos”, which included dollar foreign bonds of the Bank in the face
                            amount of $4,670,500 of guaranteed bonds and $6,503,000 of
                            non-guaranteed bonds, a total of $11, 173,500. On the last page, which
                            the Ambassador has indicated as giving the real figures, he found on the
                            liabilities side an item: dollar foreign bonds $10,939,000. The
                            Ambassador commented that this means the Bank holds about $11,000,000 of
                            its total dollar bond indebtedness of some $20,000,000, leaving about
                            $5,000,000 of guaranteed bonds and about $5,000,000 of non-guaranteed
                            bonds outstanding in the hands of the American public.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Department would want to examine the balance
                            sheet figures. In the meantime he wished to discuss several points.</p>
                        <p>At Bogotá everybody concerned felt that a settlement must comprise all
                            the dollar bonds of the Bank, whether guaranteed or nonguaranteed. A
                            settlement limited to the guaranteed bonds would not clear up the Bank’s
                            situation and have the favorable credit effect which everybody
                            desires.</p>
                        <p>He found the Bank entirely unable and unwilling to make any payment for
                            arrears of interest. He had discussed the matter before the Board of
                            Directors in the presence of the Minister of Finance. The Bank officials
                            insisted that the income of the Bank was insufficient to permit payment
                            of arrears. The net income of the Bank is some 600,000 or possibly at
                            extreme limits 700,000 pesos, say $400,000 United States currency. The
                            debt settlement, outlined in the Salazar conversations, on the basis of
                            giving the guaranteed bonds the same treatment given Colombia National
                            Bonds and giving the nonguaranteed bonds treatment comparable to that
                            given the sterling bonds of the Lazard issue, would require $600,000.
                            The Bank did not deem it possible to make any payment on arrears of
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Any settlement reached must depend on the backing of the Colombian
                            Government. There were two ways by which the Government might directly
                            back a settlement. One would be for the Government to make up the
                            $200,000 per annum shortage by appropriation and another would be for
                            the Government to issue its own bonds in substitution for the Bank’s
                            dollar bonds. Either of these would require approval by Congress. If
                            either proposal were submitted to the Congress by the Executive, it
                            could no doubt be carried through but only after prolonged debate—which
                            among other things would revive the taking over by the Agricultural
                            Mortgage Bank, a Government institution, of the assets and the
                            liabilities of the private mortgage banks. The Government bank had taken
                            over the private banks to meet emergency conditions during the
                            depression. This action has always been attacked particularly by the
                            Conservatives as burdening the taxpayers with the indebtedness of
                            private institutions. The debate would be long and bitter. If either of
                            the proposals were put to the Congress with all this debate and the
                            formalities of registration with S. E. C, no adjustment of the debt
                            could become effective at a date earlier than January 1, 1943. The
                            Government hopes that it may be practical by other means without going
                            to the Congress to reach a settlement effective by June 30 of this
                            year.</p>
                        <p>The Government can acquire some $5,000,000 of the new issue of 3%
                            National Bonds from petroleum, banking and industrial concerns in
                            Colombia. A San Francisco firm, whose name he did not recall, <pb
                                n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0229"/>has offered the Government at a
                            price slightly above the market, $3,000,000 of the old defaulted issue
                            which it has not converted into the new bonds, the proceeds to be used
                            for certain investments in Colombia, with assurances that earnings may
                            be transferred into dollars, etc. A Chicago firm, Welch and Greene, has
                            a block of $2,000,000 of the new bonds which the Colombian Government
                            can acquire. The Government also has the right to purchase its bonds in
                            the open market and can do this even if the purchases force the price to
                            par. It has been suggested that the Agricultural Mortgage Bank with the
                            cooperation of the Colombian Government could acquire bonds of this
                            outstanding issue in amounts sufficient to retire its own dollar bonds
                            held by the public, financing the acquisition through the sale of its
                            own internal obligations within Colombia. It could then offer to
                            exchange these bonds of the Colombian Government for its own dollar
                            bonds. This transaction can probably be put through within two or three
                            months, if no objection to it were found.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador produced the Prospectus of the Argentine Republic guaranty
                            of bonds of the Province of Santa Fe, a debt adjustment negotiated by
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council in which holders of 7% bonds
                            were offered an addition to the principal amount of the bonds of a sum
                            equal to 11% of such principal in satisfaction of over-due interest due
                            September 1, 1932 to March 1, 1934. He produced the Prospectus of the
                            Republic of Cuba debt adjustment bonds to show that holders of some
                            bonds were offered $1, 100 principal amount of bonds for each $1,000
                            while holders of certain other bonds were offered a par for par
                            exchange. What he was attempting to show was that the Council had
                            recommended settlements on the basis of allowing about 10% on arrears of
                            interest. He also said, and this he wished to be treated confidentially,
                            although if the matter ever came up for debate in the Colombian Congress
                            the Government might have to use the information, that Mr. Traphagen of
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council in a letter to the Ambassador
                            in January 1940 had suggested an adjustment of the guaranteed dollar
                            bonds of the Bank by an annuity of $250,000 which for the first five
                            years would provide, on the basis of $5,000,000 of bonds outstanding in
                            American hands, $150,000 for payment of interest at 3%, $50,000 for
                            purchase of past due coupons at $10 per coupon, and $50,000 for sinking
                            fund; after the first five years the interest rate would be stepped up
                            to 3½% and the sinking fund would absorb the difference between the
                            interest and the $250,000 annuity.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that holders of guaranteed bonds could be offered $1,
                            100 par value of national bonds for each $1,000 par value of
                            Agricultural Mortgage Bonds. This would require $5,500,000 of National
                            bonds. For the non-guaranteed bonds he had not worked <pb n="216"
                                xml:id="pg_216" facs="0230"/>out the amount that would be offered.
                            He submitted a copy of the text of the agreement made some years ago
                            with Lazard Bros, concerning the sterling bonds and said that, all
                            things considered, a comparable settlement in 3% Government bonds might
                            be to offer 700 or 750 dollars of the latter for $1,000 par value of
                            non-guaranteed bonds of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether an exchange of securities offer of this kind
                            could not be made without registration with S. E. C. Mr. Wright referred
                            to a recent Argentine exchange of securities which had been handled by
                            J. P. Morgan and Company without registration. Mr. Livesey said that if
                            an exchange of securities could be handled without an underwriter and
                            without solicitation on the part of any American financial house by
                            employing such a house to handle merely the physical exchange of
                            securities for a fee strictly commensurate with such limited service,
                            apparently no registration was required by our laws. The banking house
                            would no doubt seek to protect itself by consulting S. E. C. and giving
                            such information and assurances as S. E. C. might ask with regard to its
                            limited functions and fees. However, the Embassy should consult private
                            counsel on the S. E. C. matter. Mr. Wright inquired whether Mr. Laylin,
                            who had served as counsel for the Embassy in the National Bond
                            adjustment and whether he or another attorney could be consulted. The
                            Ambassador said he supposed the Embassy might still consult Mr.
                            Laylin.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council and
                            said he hoped that the Agricultural Mortgage Bank matter might be
                            handled without attack by the Council. Mr. Livesey said that he had
                            gathered from Mr. Francis White<note n="5" xml:id="d249fn5">President of
                                the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council.</note> that the Council
                            would probably regard the settlement already made with the holders of
                            direct bonds of the Colombian Government as the standard of comparison,
                            not expecting the Colombian Government to treat holders of bonds
                            guaranteed by the Colombian Government better than holders of direct
                            Government bonds. This might leave some basis for questioning details of
                            the proposed offer. However, if, as contemplated, the offer was made in
                            the name of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank and not of the Government,
                            there would be less direct occasion for the Council to attack the
                            exchange proposal. The Ambassador said that the proposal would offer
                            holders of the Bank bonds $100 principal amount of bonds in satisfaction
                            of past due coupons whereas the holders of National bonds had been given
                            $150 principal value of bonds in satisfaction of past due coupons.
                            However, the guaranteed bonds of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank are
                            selling at $26 and will be exchanged for bonds which are selling at $34,
                            thus giving the bondholders an immediate increase in value of <pb
                                n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0231"/>$80, which should compensate
                            for the $50 less of principal amount that they receive. He said that
                            since observing that in the eight months during which the National Bond
                            adjustment has been on offer, it has been accepted by 80% of the
                            American holders of National bonds (though only by 70% of all holders of
                            the bonds including those in Great Britain, the Netherlands, etc.,) the
                            Colombian authorities attach less importance to the Council’s attitude
                            than they did at the time the offer was announced under the auspices of
                            the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce, when there had been
                            considerable doubt whether American bondholders would accept or reject
                            the offer. Colombia attaches more importance to the attitude of the
                            United States authorities and public than to that of the Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Livesey said that it appeared to be the feeling of those members of
                            the American public who were present that an offer on the part of the
                            Bank to exchange Colombian National bonds for its own bonds on a basis
                            comparable in the case of guaranteed bonds with the treatment already
                            given Colombian National bonds, and in the case of non-guaranteed bonds
                            with the treatment already given other holders of such bonds was not
                            objectionable or unreasonable. It was of course possible that some
                            consideration had been overlooked and it would be the function of higher
                            officers of the Department to determine the Department’s attitude toward
                            the proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he thought the Council was unreasonable and
                            unfair in its attacks on the adjustment of the National Bonds. He
                            thought it would be unreasonable for it to attack the proposal he had
                            outlined, and in this connection Mr. Traphagen’s letter of January 1940
                            might be useful either in persuading Mr. Francis White or in rebutting
                            any published attack by the Council. He would send Mr. Livesey a copy of
                            the full text of the letter. Mr. Wright suggested that possibly the
                            Department might take up the matter with Mr. White and smooth the way
                            for the eventual proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the Department might want several days to examine the
                            papers he was leaving, after which he would take up the matter again. In
                            these unsettled times it is very desirable to complete projects
                            rapidly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Lancaster called from New York to state that the National City Bank
                            was disposed to accept in principle the proposal of the Colombian <pb
                                n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0232"/>Minister of Finance for a ten
                            years settlement of the banking debt, which would leave a balloon of
                            about $5,500,000 at the end of the period, with an understanding that
                            this would be further financed. Mr. Lancaster stated that in view of my
                            previous discussion with Ambassador Turbay the Bank felt somewhat
                            reluctant to accept the Minister of Finance’s schedule of payments
                            beginning at $800,000 in the first year, but rather would like to
                            receive $1,000,000 at the outset. One million dollars has been the basis
                            of all previous discussions.</p>
                        <p>I called Ambassador Turbay and informed him of Mr. Lancaster’s
                            conversation. The Ambassador stated that he had previously telegraphed
                            the Minister of Finance suggesting that the banking group might be
                            disposed to accept some arrangement with a balloon to be further
                            financed, and that the Minister of Finance had cabled to him the
                            proposal which he had made to the National City Bank. I indicated that
                            the bankers hoped to receive $1,000,000 in the first year and that all
                            previous discussions had been on a basis of at least $1,000,000. The
                            Ambassador stated that he would telegraph the Minister of Finance
                            indicating that the banking group would probably accept the proposal if
                            the initial payments were stepped up to $1,000,000, and recommending
                            such basis of settlement. I thanked the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>I subsequently informed Mr. Lancaster in general terms of the proposed
                            telegram from the Ambassador to the Minister of Finance, and he stated
                            that the bankers would proceed on that basis, being probably willing to
                            recede a little on the initial payments if the Minister of Finance
                            remained firm.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Turbay called me to say that he had just received a reply from
                            Bogotá stating that the memorandum<note n="7" xml:id="d252fn7">
                                <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> handed to him by the Department
                            looking to the settlement of the Colombian Agricultural Mortgage Bank
                            dollar bonds was fully acceptable to the Bank. He was sending along to
                            me a formal memorandum in this sense and the Department need not make
                            any reply to this memorandum since he considered it a reply to the
                            Department’s memorandum to him.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was delighted with the Bank’s acceptance and said that he
                            wanted to express to the Department his sincere and wholehearted
                            appreciation for its assistance. He said that steps were already being
                            taken to work out the legal details and other formalities and that he
                            had entrusted this to John Laylin, who had been the attorney in the
                            settlement of the Republic of Colombia bonds. He would want to get
                            together with the appropriate officers of the Department soon to discuss
                            any further necessary action and would let us know when he was
                            ready.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador requested that for the time being this settlement be kept
                            on a strictly confidential basis so that public knowledge would <pb

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Wright</hi>: I have looked over the texts
                            supplied by Ambassador Turbay appertaining to the offer to be made by
                            the Agricultural Mortgage Bank. It will offer 3 per cent bonds of the
                            Government of the Republic of Colombia which are already outstanding and
                            listed on the New York Stock Exchange in amounts ($1100 face value of
                            Government bonds for $1000 face value of guaranteed bonds and $750 face
                            value of Government bonds for $1000 par value of nonguaranteed bonds)
                            which at yesterday’s closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for
                            the Government bonds would give a market value of $407 for every $1000
                            guaranteed bond and $277.50 for every $1000 non-guaranteed bond. Of
                            course the bonds to be surrendered have some ten years of unpaid coupons
                            attached but still I think the offer will leave holders not too
                            dissatisfied.</p>
                        <p>One irritant to holders will be that in almost every case they will have
                            to receive “Certificates” for the parts of the $1100 and the $750 of
                            Government bonds which cannot be paid in bonds of $500 or $1000 par
                            value. They will have to sell these certificates or buy others over the
                            counter to make up $500 amounts which they can convert into Government
                            bonds, or else wait until 1945 and then be paid in cash drawn from the
                            proceeds of sale of the Government bonds not theretofore claimed under
                            the Bank’s offer. This will be a nuisance but there is no help for it.
                            The low price at which these certificates (which are not listed on the
                            Stock Exchange) will sell will somewhat diminish the above stated market
                            values of the offer so far as concerns most holders.</p>
                        <p>Any statement the Department makes in support of the offer need not touch
                            on these particulars. A statement of approbation or gratification in
                            very general terms seems entirely warranted and likely to be in line
                            with the reaction of bondholders and the interested public to the offer.
                            The persons who will remain dissatisfied are the holders of Colombian
                            departmental and municipal bonds who still await in vain for any offer
                            from the debtors. In this connection it will be noted that the offer is
                            entirely in the name of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank and that any
                            statement which the Department may make relating to the good offices of
                            the Colombian Government <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0235"/>in
                            bringing about the offer should be phrased to attribute credit but not
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>This sequel to the adjustment by the Government of Colombia in December
                            1940 of its own defaulted bonds is further concrete evidence of
                            Colombia’s determination to adjust its foreign indebtedness on an
                            equitable basis. I understand that in your discussions of this matter
                            during the past several months with Messrs. Livesey and Wright it had

                            Bogotá proposes to discuss with you and with the Colombian Government
                            the possibility of undertaking a program of health and sanitation work
                                <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0236"/>in collaboration with the
                            Government of Colombia. While the Department is fully aware of the
                            widespread opportunities for constructive work of this type which exist
                            throughout the hemisphere, the necessary supplies and in particular the
                            trained personnel needed for this type of work are becoming increasingly
                            scarce in this country and would have to be diverted from the immediate
                            war effort or from the already reduced services available to civilians
                            and defense workers in this country. The Department would therefore be
                            most reluctant to approve any project for health and sanitation work
                            unless it is clearly necessary in connection with obtaining strategic
                            materials of prime necessity to the war effort and would have a direct
                            and substantial bearing on the securing of such materials. In its
                            appraisal of the necessity of a health and sanitation program for this
                            purpose the Department would be guided primarily by your views and by
                            the opinions of the agencies of the United States Government most
                            directly concerned such as the Board of Economic Warfare and the Rubber
                            Reserve Company.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it is not considered desirable that the
                            Colombian Government be encouraged by formal or informal steps on your
                            part or on the part of other representatives of this government to
                            request that a health and sanitation program be undertaken by this
                            government until the need therefor as defined above has been fully
                            agreed upon by the U.S. Government agencies concerned. Before advising
                            the Department of your opinion in this matter you may wish to discuss
                            the situation with the representative of the Board of Economic Warfare
                            who is to arrive shortly in Bogotá.</p>

                        <p>1225. Referring to Department’s 982, September 19. Dr. Bugher of the
                            Rockefeller Foundation who is head of the Division of Special Studies of
                            the Ministry of Labor and Hygiene has worked out in conjunction with
                            officials of that Ministry a health and sanitation program for
                            presentation to President López. From the beginning one of the
                            principles emphasized has been that such a program would be undertaken
                            with the absolute minimum of professional or technical help from the
                            United States since it was realized not only that it <pb n="223"
                                xml:id="pg_223" facs="0237"/>would be difficult to obtain such help
                            under war conditions but also that it would be preferable as far as
                            possible to use Colombian doctors, a number of whom have been trained in
                            the United States under grants given by the Rockefeller Foundation
                            specifically for this purpose. Dr. Bugher has also discussed the
                            proposed plan with the military authorities in the Canal Zone since it
                            has a direct relation to sanitation of areas of possible military
                            activity in Colombia. … While the program has been discussed with
                            Pocklington of the Rubber Reserve it has not been possible to ascertain
                            from him or from Clark of the Coordinator’s Office whether additional
                            funds for the sanitation of areas in which the Rubber Reserve is
                            interested have been transferred from the Rubber Reserve to the
                            Coordinator’s Office or are otherwise available. Clarification of this
                            point would be appreciated.</p>
                        <p>President López has evinced keen interest in the nutritional program
                            outlined in Dr. Lay Martin’s telegram to the Coordinator (No. 1039 of
                            August 12, 11 p.m.<note n="12" xml:id="d256fn12">Not printed.</note>)
                            and has expressed the hope that General Dunham<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d256fn13">Brig. Gen. George C. Dunham, Director of the

                            Janeiro. I believe that it would be definitely to our advantage to
                            cooperate in a project of this nature which would be the first move of
                            social significance undertaken by the López Government.</p>
                        <p>I shall discuss the matter fully with Rockefeller on his arrival
                            September 23.</p>

                            interest expressed by President López and request made by Minister of
                            Trabajo it is requested that I be authorized to sign agreement for
                            health and sanitation program calling contribution of one million
                            dollars on the part of Coordinator’s office and for an initial budget of
                            one million pesos on the part of Colombian Government. It is my
                            recommendation that this agreement be signed in Bogotá by appropriate
                            representatives of Colombian Government and myself. It would be
                            appreciated if the Department would expedite approval so that maximum
                            value may be secured from announcement of the cooperative program
                            locally.</p>

                            which may be deemed necessary to implement the agreement. You should
                            explain to them the very real shortages of many essential materials and
                            the necessity for preserving them for war essential undertakings. While
                            the Department sympathizes with the objectives which the Colombian
                            Government aims at in a health and sanitation program, the Colombian
                            Government will recognize, we feel sure, that the allocation of
                            essential or critical equipment and materials to it must be held in
                            abeyance so long as really important war demands for them continue.</p>

                        <p>116. Rubber Reserve Company is prepared to enter into commitment with
                            Costa Rican Government to purchase entire production of rubber in Costa
                            Rica except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon) necessary for
                            domestic consumption, at price of 35 cents per pound c. and f. United
                            States continental port for usual good quality Castilloa rubber as
                            understood in New York with appropriate differentials for other grades.
                            The term of the agreement would be for 5 years, unless sooner terminated
                            by mutual consent. The Government of Costa Rica would agree to restrict
                            export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees. The
                            exportation of manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the
                            United States. Costa Rica would agree to use its best efforts to cause
                            maximum amount of rubber to be produced and made available for sale to
                            Reserve. Local labor would be financed locally for necessities for
                            collecting rubber. Some governmental agency, if desirable, would be
                            designated as the single buying agency, otherwise sales would be made
                            through usual trade channels now in existence. Price on sales to Rubber
                            Reserve would also be fixed as local sales price.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing proposal corresponds generally to agreements entered into with
                            Brazilian Government on March 3.<note n="1" xml:id="d260fn1">See

                            basis which is at least as favorable to civilian uses in the other
                            American republics as in this country. Moreover Costa Rica is obtaining
                            military supplies from this country under Lend-Lease arrangements<note

                        <p>200. Department’s 141, April 7, 9 p.m. and previous correspondence
                            regarding purchases of rubber. President Calderón informed me this
                            morning that his Government is ready to draw up an agreement with the
                            United States in accordance with the terms set forth in the Department’s
                            telegram under reference as well as the Department’s No. 116, March 19,
                            5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>It would appear to be necessary in the agreement as finally drawn up to
                            enter into certain technical details as regards the quality of rubber of
                            different classifications, the degree of moisture, quantity of foreign
                            matter, et cetera, and fixing a price for the same, and it <pb n="231"
                                xml:id="pg_231" facs="0245"/>occurs to the Legation therefore that
                            the agreement should be drawn up by a representative of the Rubber
                            Reserve Company in possession of the requisite technical knowledge.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed entirely unofficially that the Rubber Reserve
                            Company is considering the appointment as its representative of Mr.
                            Walter E. Klippert, the manager of plantations in Central America of the
                            Goodyear Rubber Company. The appointment of Mr. Klippert would be
                            entirely satisfactory to the Legation and to the Costa Rican Government
                            and I venture to suggest that if he is under consideration at present
                            his appointment be expedited and that he be authorized to negotiate a
                            contract with the Costa Rican Government either for signature by himself
                            as representative of the Rubber Reserve Company or by myself acting for
                            the American Government.</p>
                        <p>As the Costa Rican Government is anxious to cooperate with the United
                            States and has now agreed in principle to our point of view I venture to
                            urge that this matter be concluded without delay as various reports have
                            reached the Legation through trade channels that some rubber is already
                            being purchased by private interests and is being sent out of the
                            country.</p>

                        <p>In conversation with the President this afternoon, he brought up the
                            impending contract with the Rubber Reserve Board for the purchase of
                            rubber. He stated that although his Government would sign this contract
                            exactly as we had requested, without conditions, he sincerely hoped that
                            once the contract is signed we will assist Costa Rica to obtain the
                            return of a small part of the rubber in the form of tires. He added that
                            unless we do so the consequent paralyzation of automotive traffic will,
                            of course, reduce the consumption of gasoline to zero, and the very
                            important revenues which the Government now obtains from this source
                            will be completely lost.</p>
                        <p>He asked whether I would not, out of a sense of pure justice, attempt to
                            secure the permission of the State Department for Costa Rica to obtain
                            some tires after the contract has been signed. Although I, of course,
                            told him that I would do what I could, I gave him no assurances as to
                            the probable result of my endeavors.</p>

                        <p>251. Referring to the Department’s circular telegram of May 18,
                                midnight.<note n="8" xml:id="d267fn8">

                                177</ref>.</note> I urgently request a reply to my telegram number
                            200, April 21, in which I made certain suggestions about drawing up a
                            contract with the Costa Rican Government for the purchase of rubber.
                            Subsequent to that telegram Mr. Klippert has received instructions from
                            his company to commence purchase of rubber for the Rubber Reserve
                            Company. The latter has set up a credit in a local bank for this purpose
                            and Mr. Klippert is actually purchasing the rubber. Nevertheless, no
                            contract has been drawn up with the Costa Rican Government and although
                            President Calderón gave me the assurances set forth in my number 200, I
                            am apprehensive that if this matter is delayed too long, pressure may be
                            brought to bear upon him to change his mind. Only yesterday Klippert
                            informed me that the owner of a stock of rubber in Port Limón asserted
                            that he had been offered a price of 40 cents a pound for rubber by some
                            agency in Mexico and that he was requesting President Calderón’s
                            permission to dispose of his stock to this buyer.</p>

                            is suggested that you request that exports of rubber be embargoed

                            state that since my arrival here I have had numerous informal
                            conversations with Mr. Carlos Manuel Escalante, Minister of Hacienda,
                            with respect to the possibility of Costa Rica meeting its contractual
                            financial obligations in accordance with the agreement of 1939. I have
                            likewise been in informal communication with the Honorable Francis
                            White, President of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.
                            regarding the present position of the Costa Rican Government, and have
                            pointed out that due to the ever increasing governmental expenditures as
                            a result of the war and the improbability of balancing the budget,
                            unless the service on foreign obligations is curtailed, it would be
                            imprudent to assume that the Costa Rican Government can offer a total
                            service of $300,000.00 a year, as Mr. White suggested to me in his
                            letter of November 10, 1941, a copy of which I enclose<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d271fn15">Not printed.</note> for the Department’s
                            information.</p>
                        <p>As I had hoped to discuss this matter personally with the Department
                            during my proposed authorized trip to Washington in December, which was
                            cancelled because of the outbreak of the war, I have not reported by
                            despatch on the situation. The substance of my views, however, is
                            contained in a personal letter to Mr. White of December 15, 1941, the
                            pertinent portions of which I quote herewith: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have had several conversations with the Minister of Finance
                                    since last writing you. He has promised that in the future they
                                    will endeavor to carry out their obligations in a more regular
                                    manner. It is possible that he will go to the United States
                                    within the next few months and make direct contact with you so
                                    that there may be no misunderstanding in the future.</p>
                                <p>“You will appreciate that because of the situation which has
                                    developed during the past few days, Costa Rica is going to have
                                    some extraordinary expenses which will be difficult to meet
                                    under the present budget. Some of these expenses will not only
                                    be for the benefit of Costa Rica, but for the United States as
                                    well. Accordingly, I shall find it increasingly difficult to put
                                    up a reasonable argument in favor of the interests of the
                                    bondholders when the interests of the United <pb n="240"

                            appointment with you this afternoon at 5:00 o’clock. I believe the
                            purpose of the Minister’s visit is to discuss the following.</p>
                        <p>About ten days ago, the Minister told me that the President<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d272fn17">Rafael Calderón Guardia.</note> had telephoned him
                            and, over a very bad connection, informed him of the need of his
                            Government for funds with which to meet expenses incurred in connection
                            with the expansion of Costa Rica’s army. The Minister gave the
                            impression that what the President wanted was a donation of the
                            necessary funds. I explained to the Minister the difficulties in this
                            and suggested that he write the President for further details.</p>
                        <p>The Minister now has a letter from the President which refers to the
                            conversations you had in Rio with Dr. Luis Anderson.<note n="18"

                            an agricultural expert would be sent to Costa Rica to study, in
                            cooperation with the Costa Rican Government, a plan for intensive
                            production. The letter stated that you had indicated that this
                            Government would be prepared to go up to $3,000,000 to help Costa Rica
                            in this regard. Moreover, in connection with the fiscal situation, which
                            was not defined in the letter, it was stated that at Rio you had stated
                            that this Government would be ready to advance up to $2,000,000 for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the agricultural expert, I talked to Mr. Leslie
                                Wheeler<note n="19" xml:id="d272fn19">Director of Foreign
                                Agriculture Relations of the Department of Agriculture.</note> while
                            the Minister was still with me. Mr. Wheeler said that he would today
                            instruct the agricultural attaché in Panama<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d272fn20">Charles L. Luedtke.</note> to proceed to San José
                            to make there a preliminary survey for the purpose of advising with
                            respect to exactly what specialties, experts should be sent. On the
                            basis of his report and recommendation, an agricultural mission would
                            then be immediately dispatched to Costa Rica. <pb n="241"
                                xml:id="pg_241" facs="0255"/>This seemed to make sense to the
                            Minister who is advising the President by telegram of the proposed
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the fiscal situation, I suggested to the Minister that he
                            request the Minister of Finance to send him a report stating precisely
                            what is needed. On the basis of this report we can decide what to do.
                            Costa Rica has a small Lend-Lease allocation<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d272fn21">For text of Lend-Lease Agreement between the

                            however, whether it is more armament that Costa Rica needs. I think what
                            the President wants is some free funds. His letter seemed to indicate
                            that what he desired was a loan rather than a grant. The Minister also
                            indicated his acquiescence with this suggestion and said that he would
                            ask immediately for such a report.</p>

                        <p>152. The Costa Rican Minister of Finance is urgently requesting that this
                            government arrange a prompt loan of $1,000,000 to the Costa Rican
                            Treasury to enable it to pay off the Bank of Costa Rica (not the
                            National Bank) and a number of private firms for supplies and services
                            made available to the government, especially in connection with
                            operations of the Fomento Ministry. The Minister states that at the
                            moment revenues and expenditures are about on even keel, but that this
                            backlog is very difficult and is causing serious political consequences
                            due to the attitude of the creditors. The Minister, after first
                            requesting all sorts of fantastic arrangements, has now settled upon
                            increasing the $4,600,000 credit to $5,600,000 on the same conditions,
                            with a proviso that $1,000,000 of the total may be immediately devoted
                            to paying off the old accounts. The Minister admits that, although much
                            of the accounts arises originally from imports, the government is
                            obligated to pay in colones, and there is no immediate exchange problem
                            but rather a local budgetary difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The Department fully appreciates the difficult political situation of
                            Costa Rica and the economic difficulties arising out of the effects of
                            the war and especially the shipping situation. At the same time, the
                            United States has already agreed upon an extensive program of
                            cooperation, especially in connection with highways,<note n="23"

                            $1,000,000 on shorter terms, perhaps as much as five years.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance at first stated that the arrangement could not in
                            any way be carried out through the National Bank for political reasons,
                            and that the Costa Rican Government cannot go to the National Bank for
                            assistance in this matter for similar reasons. He has now indicated that
                            he will reconsider various proposals when he returns next week to Costa
                            Rica.</p>
                        <p>Pending the completion of the arrangements for the $1,000,000 credit the
                            Minister of Finance has requested the Export-Import Bank to authorize
                            the release of $500,000 of the proceeds of the gasoline tax now on
                            deposit in the National Bank of Costa Rica in accordance with the
                            Article 9 of the $4,600,000 loan contract. The funds withdrawn would be
                            redeposited in the National Bank of Costa Rica as soon as the $1,000,000
                            loan was approved. Such an arrangement would appear to require the
                            approval of the National Bank which is a party to the loan contract.</p>

                        <p>195. Referring to the Department’s telegram 152, April 18, 7 p.m. The
                            President on his own initiative sent his secretary to call upon me
                            [apparent omission] that the President urged me to support Escalante’s
                            request for financial assistance in Washington. The secretary in a state
                            of considerable agitation which from his remarks appeared to reflect the
                            President’s own state of mind asserted that failure to receive
                            assistance from the American Government would result in the inability of
                            this Government to meet the May 1st payrolls of its employees and that
                            anything might happen as a result. He mentioned nothing about payment of
                            the backlog which the Department states that Escalante stressed in his
                            conversations. He stated that the President urgently desires a loan of 2
                            million dollars <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0257"/>and is
                            confident that if such a loan is granted no further assistance from the
                            American Government will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>From what I have been able to learn it appears that President Calderón is
                            faced with a serious although perhaps not dangerous political situation
                            due to the somewhat precarious financial situation of the Government but
                            also to the widespread accusations of graft and mismanagement which are
                            being almost daily directed against him and especially against his
                            brother, the Minister of the Interior. While it is not practicable in
                            this telegram to review in detail the financial position of the
                            Government one indication of the situation is that I learn on good
                            authority that the Government has reached its legal limit of borrowing
                            in the bank of Costa Rica as the bank has already loaned the Government
                            2,300,000 colones on its current account and may not legally allow the
                            Government to overdraw further.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear that Volio’s activities are responsible for this
                            situation and in fact I learn that although he is a loyal friend of
                            President Calderón and would probably not be willing to lead any
                            movement against him, he resigned partly as a protest against dishonesty
                            and mismanagement in the present administration.</p>
                        <p>While the financial difficulties of the Government are of course
                            partially due to the drop in bases of revenues caused by the war,
                            governmental mismanagement appears to have produced a large part.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand President Calderón has as the Department is well aware,
                            cooperated with us to the fullest extent as regards the international
                            situation and is I believe a sincere friend of the United States.
                            Although I am not convinced that the failure of our Government to extend
                            financial help to Costa Rica at this time would lead to the overthrow of
                            Calderón’s Government he would undoubtedly be placed in a very difficult
                            situation and his attitude toward the United States would probably be
                            considerably cooler and less cooperative than at Bern.</p>
                        <p>After taking into consideration the various political factors involved I
                            would suggest that this Government be granted financial assistance in
                            whatever form and amount the Department decides in order to tide over
                            their immediate financial difficulties and keep President Calderón in a
                            friendly frame of mind.</p>

                        <p>I telephoned Mr. Scotten at 2:35 p.m. and after referring to the
                            Department’s telegram 152, April 18, 7 p.m. and the Legation’s 195, <pb
                                n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0258"/>April 19, 6 p.m., I stated that
                            a decision had been reached to assist the Costa Rican Government
                            financially and that a proposal or proposals as to how this might be
                            done would be handed to Señor Escalante, the Finance Minister, prior to
                            his departure from Washington this afternoon. I said, however, that
                            there did not seem to be any way for us to be of assistance without the
                            passage of pertinent legislation by the Costa Rican Government and
                            possibly agreement on the part of the National Bank. The proposal made
                            by Señor Escalante involving the use of the gasoline tax was not
                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the first paragraph of San José’s 195, I said that Señor
                            Escalante had persistently stated that current revenues and expenditures
                            of the Costa Rican Government were more or less balanced and that the
                            financial assistance now requested was to take care of an accumulated
                            floating debt built up over the past couple of years. On the other hand,
                            the telegram refers to the possible inability to meet May 1
                            payrolls.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that while the financial situation facing the
                            Government is a serious one, he believes that our proposal will meet the
                            requirements of the Costa Rican Government. He pointed out that the
                            regular session of Congress takes place early in May and that,
                            furthermore, there is nothing to prevent the President from calling a
                            special session if he so desires.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that our proposals involved assistance to the extent
                            of a maximum of $1,000,000.</p>

                            $1,000,000 credit made by the Export-Import Bank. It urges

                            $1,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The Minister intimated that his Government had taken this step because of

                        <p>224. Referring to Department’s 174, May 5, 9 p.m. The Costa Rican
                            Minister is apparently correct in his statement that the approval of
                            Congress would be necessary for the increase of the existing credit.
                            Paragraph 16–A of article 73 of the Costa Rican Constitution assigns to
                            Congress the right to authorize the Executive to negotiate loans or make
                            other contracts and to mortgage the national revenues as security
                            therefor.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the President desires to avoid congressional discussion
                            of a loan, fearing that it would bring to light at least incompetence
                            and mismanagement and possibly dishonesty on the part of the present
                            administration. This situation was reported in my personal letter of
                            April 27 to Mr. Bonsal and in the last paragraph of my despatch No. 135
                            of April 29.<note n="26" xml:id="d277fn26">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President would naturally prefer a secret loan with which he could
                            tide over the present financial crisis of his administration.</p>
                        <p>I doubt the wisdom of granting such a credit however which might result
                            in a situation similar to that following the loan to the Tinoco
                            Government by the Royal Bank of Canada in 1917 or 1918 which was
                            followed by arbitration by the Chief Justice of the United States<note

                            decided that as the loan had not had the approval of the Costa Rican
                            Congress it was not an obligation of the Costa Rican Government.</p>
                        <p>While a secret loan or even gift to a friendly government or a government
                            which the United States wished to keep on friendly terms during the war
                            might in some cases be advisable from the standpoint of expedience I do
                            not consider such a situation to exist here as even if the present
                            Government should fall the entry into power of any group unfriendly to
                            the United States and consequently dangerous to our war effort is most
                            unlikely.</p>
                        <p>Should no financial assistance be accepted by the President at present it
                            is possible that the political crisis might become so acute as to cause
                            his resignation. However, I believe it likely that should we offer no
                            alternative to some proposal involving congressional approval, such
                            approval would be obtained. No doubt the congressional debate would
                            include some violent criticism of the Government but its large majority
                            would in all probability ensure the acceptance of the loan.</p>

                        <p>267. Referring to Department’s 195, May 21, 10 p.m. The Costa Rican
                            Minister of Finance is of the opinion that the proposition embodied in
                            the Department’s telegram under reference was drafted before receipt of,
                            or at least the study by the Export-Import Bank, of the proposition
                            which he forwarded to Warren Pierson on May 8 through the Costa Rican
                            Legation in Washington. He considers that proposition more advantageous
                            to his Government than the one proposed in the Department’s 195 and
                            would appreciate an immediate examination of it and a reply before
                            making a decision on the proposition which the Department has just
                            advanced. The Minister of Finance asked me to call the Department’s
                            attention to the fact that what his Government urgently needs is a
                            credit which can be utilized immediately in order to tide over the
                            present very critical situation. He believes his proposition of May 8
                            would permit a more rapid utilization of the credit than the one
                            proposed in the Department’s 195 and would be more acceptable to the
                            Congress.</p>

                        <p>As regards the proposition in the last paragraph of the Department’s
                            telegram the Minister of Finance is delighted at the suggestion of
                            sending one or two experts here. He believes the presence of such
                            experts would be of the greatest assistance in working out a long term
                            reorganization of Costa Rican finances and he feels that his Government
                            is prepared to cooperate with such experts in every way. He will speak
                            to the President about this matter this afternoon and if as he believes
                            the President will have the same idea as himself, either the Minister of
                            Finance or the President will send me within the next few days an
                            official request for the services of these experts.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance asked me to explain that the credit which his
                            Government is endeavoring to obtain at the present time is needed with
                            the utmost urgency and that it should not wait until the arrival of
                            these experts.</p>

                        <p>207. Your 267, May 23, 2 p.m. The letters of the Minister of Finance to
                            Mr. Pierson and to the Minister in Washington were carefully considered
                            both in the Department and the Export-Import Bank, and the Department
                            cannot recommend to the Export-Import Bank that such proposal be
                            adopted. This matter was also fully discussed with the Minister while he
                            was in Washington and turned down at that time.</p>
                        <p>The Minister is in effect asking that we finance a budget deficit for 18
                            years. The 9 years offered in the Department’s 195 is excessive for this
                            type of credit. As to the speed of utilization of the credit, if the
                            Congress of Costa Rica will approve the necessary enabling legislation,
                            either type of proposal can be implemented at once. The Government of
                            the United States has never offered financial assistance to anyone on
                            terms as liberal as those contained in the Department’s 195. Please
                            inform the Finance Minister accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The Department is unable to understand the insistence of the Costa Rican
                            Government on the proposal to incorporate the $1,000,000 credit in the
                            existing $4,600,000 road credit. Due to the radically different uses to
                            which the new credit would be put, an extensive revision of the old
                            contract and submission of the amended text to the Costa Rican Congress
                            would apparently be necessary in any case.</p>

                        <p>279. Referring to my telegram no. 267, May 27 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >23</hi>], 2 p.m., I have received from the Minister of Finance a letter
                            written with the approval of the President requesting the experts
                            referred to in the Department’s 195, May 21, 10 p.m. The letter adds
                            that the President considers that in order to avoid erroneous
                            interpretations which would be inconvenient for both Governments the
                            present negotiations for the $1,000,000 credit should be completed
                            before the experts are appointed (obviously the Costa Rican Government
                            wishes to avoid creating the impression that our Government had made the
                            sending of the experts a condition for the granting of the credit).</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance again urged in a personal conversation
                            consideration by the Eximbank of his proposition of May 18 [<hi
                                rend="italic">8</hi>]. He called my attention to the fact that the
                            proposition embodied in the Department’s 195 would necessitate the Costa
                            Rican Government establishing a new source of revenue to meet the
                            service charges on the loan whereas the proposition of May 8 would not
                            require such new revenue being established.</p>
                        <p>In spite of the many accusations, whether true or false, of financial
                            mismanagement on the part of this administration I feel that the ready
                            acceptance by this Government of the experts suggested by the Department
                            is a real evidence of a willingness to have the state of Costa Rican
                            finances [apparent omission] close by impartial observers and a definite
                            evidence of a willingness to cooperate with us. For this reason and also
                            due to the fact that with the probable withdrawal of the banana boats
                            contemplated in the Department’s 196 of May 22, 3 p.m.,<note n="30"

                            pass through very difficult times, I consider the Department might very

                            Escalante’s negotiations.</p>

                        <p>The Minister came in at my request. I explained to him the reasons why
                            the Department was unable to consider the Costa Rican Finance Minister’s
                            proposal for adding to the current public works credit an amount of
                            $1,000,000 on the same terms for the purpose of meeting certain fiscal
                            obligations. I stressed the fact that our offer for a $1,000,000
                            separate nine year credit was an extremely liberal one considering the
                            purposes for which the money is to be expended. The Minister expressed
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then entered into a discussion of Costa Rican politics.

                            meet amortization payments and that the Government does not wish to
                            contract an obligation which it will be unable to repay. He also stated
                            that Julio Pena, Manager of Banco Nacional, who is now in Washington
                            attending the Inter-American Banking Conference, has been fully informed

                        <p>The Costa Rican Minister came in to see me this morning. The Finance
                            Minister, Señor Escalante, still feels that the nine-year credit which
                            we offered is not wholly satisfactory. However, he has asked Francisco
                            Calderón Guardia,<note n="34" xml:id="d286fn34">Costa Rican Minister of
                                Interior and Public Security.</note> who is in this country and who
                            will be in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday<note n="35"
                                xml:id="d286fn35">June 17 and 18.</note> to find out whether we
                            could not increase the amount to $2,000,000, leaving the terms the same.
                            The reason for this is that the taxes which it is proposed to encumber
                            for this purpose (probably the tobacco and beer taxes) produce 2,000,000
                            colones per annum and would, therefore, warrant a larger credit than the
                            $1,000,000 originally suggested. In other words, if these taxes are to
                            be encumbered, the Costa Ricans want to get the maximum credit.</p>
                        <p>Please let me have an indication of your views as to the reply which we
                            should make.</p>

                        <p>264. The Export-Import Bank has offered to lend Costa Rica $2,000,000 to
                            stabilize its economy and the orderly marketing of its products, of
                            which $1,000,000 will be available immediately and the balance as
                            mutually agreed prior to December 31, 1943. The interest rate is to be
                            4%. The loan is to be amortized in six 5% semiannual installments,
                            beginning 30 months from date; four 7½% semi-annual installments,

                            conversations between officers of the Department and the Export-Import
                            Bank regarding the request of the Government of Costa Rica for a credit
                            of $2,000,000 to assist in the development of the resources, to
                            stabilize the economy and to assist in the orderly marketing of the
                            products of the Republic of Costa Rica.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes it desirable that every possible effort be made
                            by the Export-Import Bank to meet the request of the Government of Costa
                            Rica in order to assure economic and political stability in that country
                            during this crucial period. The Department accordingly recommends that
                            the Export-Import Bank consider favorably the extension of a credit
                            directly to the Government of Costa Rica up to $2,000,000, of which
                            $1,000,000 shall be available immediately upon approval of the credit by
                            the Congress of the Republic of Costa Rica, the balance of the credit to
                            be made available from time to time as mutually agreed upon between the
                            Republic of Costa Rica and the Export-Import Bank. The Department feels
                            that the credit should be amortized over a period of nine years as
                            requested by the Government of Costa Rica.</p>

                            you, I gathered that you felt that it would be advisable to abandon the
                            plan to send a joint Army, Navy and Marine Corps Mission to Cuba,
                            provided a Cuban-United States defense commission were set up on which

                            should be grateful if you would be good enough to tell me whether my
                            understanding is correct as a memorandum has just been received <pb

                            believe that this should now be abandoned and the Navy Department so
                            informed, will you please let me know.</p>
                        <p>I have been told that the War and Navy Departments have been giving
                            consideration to your recommendation for the establishment of the joint
                            Cuban-United States defense commission. In so far, however, as I have
                            been able to ascertain, the President has not yet mentioned this matter
                            to General Marshall.<note n="7" xml:id="d290fn7">Gen. George C.

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that during a conversation this morning with the Minister of State, Dr.
                            Cortina, we discussed the establishment of the Cuban military zone
                            complementary to our naval base at Guantánamo. The Minister said that he
                            had the last draft before him, and it had had his study and he was about
                            to clear it with President Batista. He expressed the hope that it would
                            be possible to complete the arrangements for the establishment of the
                            Cuban zone before my departure on February 7. I took this occasion to
                            impress upon the Minister the desirability of progress on this matter.
                            The Minister said that he had not been pressing the matter himself as he
                            felt that we had not shown much interest therein recently, or at least
                            that our Navy Department had not shown much interest therein. He said
                            that he and I had given considerable study to this matter with the
                            desire to reach a conclusion, but that the Navy Department had always
                            been slower than the Cuban Government in acting on the various drafts. I
                            told the Minister that I thought he was under a misapprehension with
                            regard to the degree of interest of our Government and of the Navy
                            Department, and that I hoped he would clear this matter with President
                            Batista and his colleagues in the Cabinet before my departure for my new
                            post. He said that he would make every effort to do so.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Welles<note n="11" xml:id="d292fn11">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary

                            question of whether a Defense Commission similar to the Mexican one
                            should be established or whether it would be preferable to send to Cuba
                            a Military, Naval, and Marine Commission to assist in the Cuban Army and

                            made reveals that there is no conflict between the six observation
                            planes mentioned by Captain Spears and the seven Army planes mentioned
                            by Colonel Barber. The six observation planes are Amphibians, Model
                            G21B, and have no connection with the five SNO–1’s and the two JRF–5’s
                            referred to by Colonel Barber. With reference to the dates of delivery,
                            Captain Spears tells me that in all probability only two of the G21B’s
                            could be delivered this calendar year owing to lack of funds. The
                            remainder will be delivered later.</p>
                        <p>We have consulted the Navy Department on the subject of cabin cruisers

                            told that, although there are no cabin cruisers capable of being used as
                            patrol boats available at present, the Bureau of Ships has been
                            requested to expedite the delivery of the 83-foot coast guard patrol
                            boats which are under construction for Cuba under the Lend-Lease
                                agreement.<note n="17" xml:id="d293fn17">For text of agreement,

                            that the ships will be delivered during the course of the present
                            calendar year. Furthermore, Cuba is now being detached from the Tenth
                            Naval District at San Juan and transferred to the Seventh Naval District
                            at Key West. This will enable the maintenance of a permanent
                            communication by radio which it is believed will be of considerable
                            assistance in case of emergency. The Commandant of the Seventh Naval
                            District has been requested to communicate with your Naval Attaché in
                            order to provide close liaison between his district and the Cuban Navy.
                            With reference to the dispatch of destroyers, patrol boats and aircraft
                            to Habana, the Office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet is giving
                            this matter consideration. This office points out, however, the
                            difficulty of detaching vessels or aircraft, in view of the critical
                            situation which exists in the southern part of the Caribbean. We
                            understand, of course, the alarm felt by the Cuban people and will do
                            everything possible to assist them consistent with the vital necessity
                            of keeping our fighting fronts adequately reinforced. In the long run,
                            this policy should be the best protection for the Cubans.</p>
                        <p>The advisability of establishing a Defense Commission or some similar
                            organization has been again brought to the attention of the War and Navy
                            Departments. Both of these Departments are now considering the question
                            sympathetically so that I believe we will bring <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0272"/>the matter to a satisfactory conclusion
                            very soon. We shall, of course, let you know as soon as plans have been
                            sufficiently completed.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Ambassador Messersmith’s
                            despatch No. 3355 of January 28, 1942, and previous correspondence
                            concerning the proposed supplementary zone at Guantánamo, I have the
                            honor to report that I took occasion to remind the Minister of State of
                            this matter during a conversation yesterday, and to express the hope
                            that his Government would shortly be in a position to make known its
                            views concerning its most recent draft (Draft G). I referred to the fact
                            that the latest draft was delivered to the Minister over two months ago
                            and that my Government is hopeful of early conclusion of the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cortina said that he has now completed his own study of the draft and
                            that he finds it “in general satisfactory”. He said that final clearance
                            of the text on behalf of his Government must, however, be approved by
                            President Batista, and he proposed to seek an early opportunity to bring
                            the matter to the President’s attention. He again referred to delays
                            running into several months during which our Government “had the file”,
                            but concluded by stating that he realizes the desirability of an early
                            conclusion of the matter. He added that the signed agreement will have
                            to be submitted to the Cuban Senate for approval.</p>
                        <p>I doubt whether the Cuban Government will desire to conclude the
                            agreement prior to the elections scheduled for March 15. I perceive no
                            reason, however, why the matter should be delayed subsequent to that
                            date, assuming that the Cuban Government does not desire to introduce
                            any further modifications.</p>

                        <p>175. Commander Naval District, Key West, recommended the establishment of

                            obviously greatly facilitate patrol of Yucatán channel and area off

                        <p>181. Your 175, April 4, noon. The Navy Department feels that since the
                            proposed base at San Julián constitutes one of several measures which
                            are being taken pursuant to Cuban requests for additional naval
                            assistance and since the staff conversations provide, <hi rend="italic"
                                >inter alia</hi>, for close liaison between the Seventh Naval
                            District at Key West and Cuban Naval Headquarters, it is preferable
                            that, in the interests of promptness and decentralization of command,
                            matters of this kind should be handled by the Naval Attaché in
                            consultation with you, without reference to Washington unless, in your
                            judgment, special factors render the latter course desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department agrees to instruct the Commander, Seventh Naval
                            District, to give your Naval Attaché advance notice to meet the request
                            in the second paragraph of your telegram.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in the foregoing but desires that you keep it
                            promptly informed of all important developments.</p>

                                >Not printed.</note> we explained the estimates for the construction
                            work in which the Government of Cuba desires to invest the new
                            $7,500,000 in the event that the expansion of the original loan is
                            agreed to by Your Government.</p>

                            treating in a concise way, of the camps which it is necessary to build
                            in Cuba for the war emergency, as well as of the possibility of
                            acquiring coast artillery, composed of 8", 10", and 12" cannon, which
                            has generously been offered by Your Government.</p>
                        <p>I wish to make it a matter of record that, with regard to the National
                            Air Field which is described in the accompanying Memorandum, the
                            President of my country is happy to consent that, as an objective proof
                            of close cooperation in the present war, an Aviation School be
                            constructed at the said field, if the Government of the United States so
                            desires, for the American Air Forces to be used for training of citizens
                            of this country, for the entire duration of the present conflict in
                            which both of our countries find themselves involved, with the sole
                            request that training opportunities in the said School be given to Cuban
                            youth and members of the Armed Forces of Cuba.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to
                            previous correspondence and conversations concerning defense measures of
                            interest to the Governments of Cuba and the United States and to inform
                            Your Excellency that recent developments in the Caribbean area have
                            suggested to my Government certain additional measures of an urgent
                            character to meet the problem of enemy activities. I have accordingly
                            been instructed by my Government to state that the Government of the
                            United States would appreciate the cooperation of Your Excellency’s
                            Government in connection with the following matters:</p>
                        <p>(1) Development of emergency airplane landing facilities in Oriente
                            Province. Permission is sought for a small group of officers from the
                            Naval Station at Guantánamo to make the necessary reconnaissance
                            investigations of areas under consideration. Should suitable areas be
                            found, authorization is requested from Your Excellency’s Government to
                            make arrangements for the use thereof, presumably on a lease basis, for
                            the period of the war, as emergency landing fields. I need not add that
                            should Your Excellency’s Government desire to detail an official or
                            officials to accompany these survey groups, this would be highly
                            gratifying to my Government.</p>
                        <p>Although definite selection of areas will await the making of the
                            surveys, three such areas are tentatively under consideration at the
                            present time: the first is approximately twenty-five miles to the west
                            of the Naval Station on lands understood to be owned by Central Ermita,
                            the second is in the vicinity of Cape Maisí about fifty miles east of
                            the Naval Station, and the third at a point to be selected probably to
                            the northeast of the city of Guantánamo.</p>
                        <p>(2) Permission is sought for torpedo patrol craft based at Guantánamo to
                            utilize certain bays on the northeast coast of Cuba, for the primary
                            purpose of extending the radius of operation of these craft in submarine
                            patrol work. At the present time the necessity of returning to
                            Guantánamo materially limits the radius of action, and it is hoped that
                            the permission of the Cuban Government, in accordance with the
                            understanding already existing between the General Staffs of Cuba and
                            the United States, may be extended so that these vessels on patrol may
                            put in at such places at Bahía Mata, Puerto Sama, and perhaps elsewhere
                            on the northeastern littoral as far west as Nuevitas Bay. It would not
                            be the present intention to station any shore detachments in connection
                            with such patrols, although it would be appreciated if the permission in
                            question can include authorization for the crews of the patrol vessels
                            to proceed ashore with certain equipment, while the torpedo patrol craft
                            are calling at or operating out of these ports.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0276"/>
                        <p>(3) Installation of mobile coast artillery guns at Escondido Bay east of
                            the Naval Station area, and at a point not yet selected approximately
                            the same distance to the west of the western boundary of the Naval
                            Station. In order that these guns may be manned constantly, it would be
                            proposed to build temporary quarters for the gun crews, and to connect
                            the gun emplacements by telephone with the Naval Station itself.</p>
                        <p>In bringing the above projects to the favorable attention of Your
                            Excellency, I have the honor to state that my Government is deeply
                            appreciative of the constant and effective cooperation which it is
                            receiving from Your Excellency’s Government in matters pertaining to
                            joint defense, which cooperation is of the highest value in coping
                            successfully with enemy activity in this area.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the discussions which have been in progress during the
                            past year relative to the establishment of a Cuban military zone for
                            joint defense in the neighborhood of the Naval Station at Guantánamo, I
                            may add that while this project has not been abandoned by the Government
                            of the United States, certain changes in the general situation, as well
                            as the withdrawal of a considerable proportion of the United States
                            personnel previously based at the Naval Station, render it in the
                            judgment of my Government unnecessary to complete these negotiations at
                            this time. My Government recalls with sincere gratification Your
                            Excellency’s high spirit of collaboration in connection with the
                            proposed establishment of this military zone and believes that it may
                            have occasion in the future to renew consideration of this project.</p>

                        <p>239. The Department has been requested by the War Department to
                            facilitate an exploratory and preliminary visit of inspection of certain
                            sites in Cuba, particularly Camagüey, for the purpose of possibly
                            locating and establishing one of several combined British-American
                            bombardment operational training units, should the Cuban Government be
                            favorably disposed towards its consideration.</p>
                        <p>The arrangements that may result contemplate the leasing of certain lands
                            and the construction of facilities for the training of advanced pilots
                            especially in over-water flight. The personnel might comprise between
                            2,500 and 4,000 U.S. operating personnel and British students. Under
                            present plans the advanced nature of the training <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0277"/>would appear to preclude the
                            possibility of making available instruction for the armed forces of
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Since the present mission is preliminary and exploratory, no definite
                            commitments are to be undertaken until the results have been reviewed by
                            the interested agencies of this Government.</p>
                        <p>The personnel of the mission will include: Brig. General William Ord
                            Ryan, Group Captain R. H. S. Spaight, Royal Air Force, Lt. Col. Ray T.
                            Middleton, and a crew of nine men. It is probable that General Ryan will
                            wish to have technical engineering data secured by members of the
                            mission in anticipation of successful negotiations.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to facilitate the visit of the mission, arriving at
                            Habana late afternoon of May 8, and to assign a member of your staff to
                            accompany it. You are likewise requested to make every effort to avoid
                            publicity in connection therewith.</p>

                        <p>The proposal outlined in the foregoing telegram is of such scope that I
                            do not believe it would be desirable for any discussion thereof to be
                            undertaken by General Ryan during his forthcoming preliminary survey but
                            that if in the light of his findings and subsequent full consideration
                            of all the implications by the interested agencies of our Government it
                            is desired to go forward, the project then be broached officially. I
                            shall accordingly suggest to General Ryan that he confine his statements
                            to Cuban officials to the fact that he is making exploratory and
                            preliminary investigation of certain air facilities.</p>
                        <p>In particular I believe it would be undesirable to include in the

                            the above telegram. Numerous Cuban pilots are receiving instruction in
                            the United States at the present time and to state at the outset that a
                            project of this scope undertaken in Cuba and requiring for its
                            successful development whole-hearted cooperation by the Cuban Government
                            would not be available to any Cuban citizens would in my opinion cause
                            the worst possible impression and even adversely affect future
                            cooperation on other matters.</p>

                        <p>286. Department’s telegram no. 246 of May 9, 6 p.m., etc. You are
                            requested to present to the Cuban Government a confidential memorandum
                            setting forth along the following lines the proposal of the War
                            Department discussed with you recently by General Ryan: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The United States War Department desires to establish with the
                                    least delay possible a heavy bombardment operational training
                                    unit under United States Army officers in the neighborhood of
                                    San Antonio de los Baños to perfect trained British Royal Air
                                    Force personnel in combat techniques preparatory to assignment
                                    to more active theaters of war. This unit would complete the
                                    chain of such training bases already being set up in southern
                                    sea-coast states and at Nassau. The combat teams completing
                                    their training in these bases will at the same time be available
                                    for effective anti-submarine and other war operations.</p>
                                <p>In the knowledge of the eagerness of the Cuban Government to
                                    contribute more actively in the prosecution of the war and its
                                    anxiety to expedite measures for protection of its coasts and
                                    shipping between Cuba and the United States, the United States
                                    Government desires urgently to know whether the Cuban Government
                                    agrees in principle to the establishment of the facilities in
                                    question under the military jurisdiction of United States
                                    officers. Details concerning the base would be worked out
                                    through negotiation between the Cuban Government and the United
                                    States Ambassador, assisted by Army technical officers of Cuba
                                    and the United States. In case of approval in principle by the
                                    Cuban Government the United States War Department would initiate
                                    surveys at once in order to indicate the specific areas it has
                                    in mind and would enter into arrangements with local
                                    contractors, wherever possible, for the preliminary work. It is
                                    contemplated that the Cuban Government would condemn the
                                    necessary lands, which it would make available for the War
                                    Department’s use, and that the Cuban Government’s reasonable
                                    expenses in this connection would be fully reimbursed. The
                                    agreement should be for the period of the war plus, say, 6
                                    months after the termination of hostilities, and all fixed
                                    installations erected at the expense of this Government would of
                                    course revert to the Cuban Government.</p>
                                <p>As now envisaged by the War Department, there would be stationed
                                    at the base a maximum of 3,600 officers and enlisted men,
                                    including about 1,400 personnel of the British Royal Air Force
                                    preparing for active combat duty in war zones. Entire
                                    responsibility for administration, discipline, etc., would of
                                    course remain in the hands of the United States Commandant.</p>
                                <p>The establishment of such an operational training unit will
                                    result in very considerable movements of matériel and supplies
                                    for construction operation, maintenance, and subsistence, and of
                                    personnel, through Habana, and between Habana and San Antonio de
                                    los Baños, mostly by highway. The United States Government is
                                    confident that the Cuban Government will be agreeable to
                                    cooperative arrangements for the expeditious handling in Cuban
                                    ports of ships and official cargo <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                                        facs="0280"/>in connection with the construction,
                                    maintenance and supply of the base and for the overland transit
                                    of matériel and supplies between the port and the base. The
                                    United States Government will be prepared to defray the costs of
                                    any necessary improvements and maintenance of, and repairs to,
                                    the highways it uses. The United States Government requests
                                    exemption from import duties, excise taxes and other fees on the
                                    official matériel and supplies imported solely for use at the
                                    base, and on the Government transports arriving at Cuban ports
                                    with official cargoes and personnel. Furthermore, the United
                                    States Government will hold itself responsible for the conduct
                                    and repatriation of the personnel, both military or civilian,
                                    which it will send to the base.</p>
                                <p>Because of the urgent demands of the war fronts for
                                    ever-increasing numbers of trained air combat crews and the
                                    intensification of warfare on numerous fronts, and in view of
                                    the added protection the base will give to Cuba, the United
                                    States Government earnestly hopes that the Cuban Government will
                                    give this proposal, which will so materially aid in the war
                                    effort of the United Nations, immediate and sympathetic
                                    consideration. End of substance of memorandum.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>If the above is acceptable in principle to the Cuban Government, you are
                            requested to ascertain and report the form which the agreement should
                            take. The Department is of the opinion that an executive agreement as
                            between co-belligerents, in an exchange of notes, would be most
                            expeditious and convenient. Further details of the proposal will be
                            transmitted to you within a day or two in a War Department
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the Cuban Government notifies you of its acceptance in
                            principle of the proposal, the War Department will send a representative
                            (possibly Colonel Barber) to assist you in the ensuing negotiations, and
                            will also send personnel to conduct the survey in the vicinity of San
                            Antonio de los Baños.</p>
                        <p>Confidential for the Ambassador: While the establishments envisaged at
                            San Antonio de los Baños and the other similar bases have no facilities
                            for training individual aviation officers or men, the Department will if
                            you deem it desirable explore the possibility of affording primary and
                            advanced army training for selected Cuban members of the armed forces at
                            suitable training centers.</p>

                        <p>339. Department’s telegram No. 286, May 21, 10 p.m. A memorandum based on
                            the above instruction was handed to President <pb n="267"
                                xml:id="pg_267" facs="0281"/>Batista this afternoon and he readily
                            agreed in principle to the establishment of the proposed training unit.
                            He added that in view of his own forthcoming trip to Oriente Province,
                            he would immediately direct the Minister of State to undertake with me
                            the proposed negotiations. I see no reason, therefore, why a
                            representative of the War Department should not proceed at once to
                            Habana.</p>
                        <p>The only departure from the Department’s telegram No. 286 in my
                            memorandum to President Batista is in regard to acquisition of land
                            areas. My memorandum suggests that these be made available without
                            expense (instead of on a reimbursement basis) in view of the Cuban
                            Government’s keen interest in the development of San Antonio de los
                            Baños and the extensive installations which will revert to the Cuban
                            Government at the end of the arrangement. However, in order to insure
                            all improvements being made by United States and not by the Cuban
                            Government as Batista had planned, it may be desirable for United States
                            to assume expropriation cost of the land required.</p>
                        <p>He [<hi rend="italic">We?</hi>] explained to the President the possible
                            complications relative to giving this advanced instruction to Cuban
                            trainees at the proposed center, adding however that we would hope to
                            make such training available elsewhere, as indicated in the last
                            paragraph of the Department’s telegram.</p>

                        <p>495. For Duggan. Some weeks ago Cortina suggested that it would
                            facilitate Cuban-American military and naval cooperation if we
                            negotiated an executive agreement which would cover in general terms all
                            of the various kinds of cooperation which have been the basis of a
                            series of specific requests for the use of Cuban facilities, et cetera,
                            during the past 6 months. I have accordingly prepared a draft agreement
                            which I left with the Minister of State this morning as a [basis] for
                            further discussion. In form it follows the air port training project

                            necessary construction. Your views as to the necessity of a formal
                            agreement concerning San Julián and also as to the most appropriate
                            detailed approach to the several points of the War Department’s plan
                            will be appreciated. You should not approach Cuban Government pending

                            Washington addressed a note to the Department in which, among other

                            previously by the War Department to supply the Cuban Government with
                            coast defense artillery.</p>

                        <p>502. Department’s 407, July 2, 10 p.m. With respect to paragraphs number
                            1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, I see no objection and believe Cubans would welcome
                            their inclusion in tripartite agreement suggested to me by Minister of
                            State and Mexican Ambassador. In fact, Cubans will prefer to have United
                            States handle all construction aspects of this undertaking and these
                            might even be covered in a separate agreement.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, I believe paragraph number 4 can readily be obtained. However,
                            Cuba, in my opinion, will also wish to incorporate following provisions
                            in proposed agreement: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Such Mexican and/or Cuban military aviators and planes as
                                    might participate in Yucatán channel patrol to be housed and
                                    serviced at the San Julián Field.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Fixed improvements exclusive of temporary or demountable
                                    buildings to become Cuban property upon termination of

                            </list>

                        <p>Permission for preliminary surveys should be forthcoming promptly on
                            request.</p>
                        <p>Since Mexican participation in this particular development has been
                            raised by the Mexicans and ourselves I believe Cubans will now greatly
                            prefer a formal tripartite agreement.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador<note n="31" xml:id="d311fn31">The Cuban Ambassador,
                                Aurelio F. Concheso.</note> stated that on April 13 he had presented
                            a note to the Department requesting an increase in the lend-lease
                            allocation for Cuba from $7,000,000 to $15,000,000. One of the purposes
                            for which this increased allocation was desired was the construction of
                            barracks for the Cuban Army, which will be augmented by the draft which
                            will take place in Cuba early in August. The present Cuban Army consists
                            of about 20,000 men. It is contemplated that an additional 25,000 to
                            35,000 men will be taken into the Army. As things stand today there are
                            no barracks in which to house the new recruits. Moreover, the present
                            Army is insufficiently equipped with rifles, machine guns, et cetera.
                            There will be nothing with which to train the new Army.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0291"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he had not yet received any indication of the
                            attitude of this Government with respect to an increased lend-lease
                            allocation for Cuba. Since the note was presented, the situation has
                            changed somewhat by the decision of the United States Government to
                            construct and equip at its own expense a large airport for training
                            purposes at San Antonio de los Baños. The Ambassador indicated that this
                            might make possible the diminution of the additional assistance
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador whether it would not be possible to utilize a part
                            of the existing lend-lease allocation for the construction of barracks,
                            provided that both Governments were in agreement that this was an
                            expenditure desirable and essential to the defense of the Western
                            Hemisphere. The Ambassador replied that this was impossible, since the
                            $7,000,000 had already been fully allocated and requisitions filed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the President was disturbed by the situation.
                            He wanted to increase the Army in order to make troops available to the
                            United States if desired. The Congress had passed a conscription law.
                            Action in accordance with the law was about to be instituted. It would
                            be very unfortunate to induct into the Army 25,000 to 35,000 men and
                            then have no place to house them and nothing to train them with.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I would look into the matter.</p>

                        <p>For your information certain changes in joint Anglo-American plans have
                            resulted in a change in plans for the use of San Antonio de los Baños

                        <p>You may mention in taking the foregoing up with the Cuban authorities the
                            satisfaction of the State and War Departments with Dr. Cortina’s
                            constructive suggestion of an agreement for military-naval cooperation

                            importance of obtaining the foregoing specific permissions without
                            awaiting conclusion of either (1) the tripartite agreement, or (2) Dr.
                            Cortina’s general cooperation agreement.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the tripartite agreement, the draft should provide that
                            Mexico grants to the United States and Cuba at Mérida the same
                            privileges granted at San Julián by Cuba to the United States and
                            Mexico. The general cooperation agreement should greatly facilitate new
                            arrangements, as they become necessary, similar to the one now sought.
                            You may inform Dr. Cortina that the Department together with the War and
                            Navy Departments is already studying his draft and that we shall
                            endeavor to communicate with you on the matter very soon.</p>

                        <p>Cortina then said he was extremely desirous of concluding the proposed
                            general agreement at the earliest possible moment and that it should be
                            a document enabling us to send into Cuba “one hundred to one hundred
                            thousand men” and should obviate the necessity for our repeated requests
                            for permission to act in such matters thus enabling us to take immediate
                            action whenever we feel it desirable. Should the Department have any
                            suggestions on this agreement I hope they can immediately be
                            transmitted.</p>
                        <p>Cortina has now apparently abandoned the idea of a tripartite agreement
                            and states that the question of use of facilities by Mexico on a
                            reciprocal basis can be worked out after our signature of the general
                            agreement. I see no objection to this course.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador came in to see me this morning. I conveyed to him
                            the substance of the information contained in the memorandum of
                            conversation dated July 14,<note n="38" xml:id="d315fn38">Not
                                printed.</note> and explained that it would be impracticable to
                            provide lend-lease funds to purchase the land mentioned in the
                            Ambassador’s memorandum of April 13. With reference to the construction
                            material and plumbing for the barracks, I said that these articles were
                            very difficult to obtain in the United States, and inquired whether they
                            could be procured locally in Cuba. If so, such funds could possibly be
                            used in this connection as well as to purchase the necessary lighting
                            equipment for the airfields.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his disappointment. He said that he would
                            communicate with President Batista with a view to ascertaining whether
                            sufficient stocks of hardware exist in Cuba, in order that they could be
                            “frozen” to provide the requisite amount for the barracks.</p>
                        <p>I then mentioned the great difficulty of providing the rifles for the
                            recruits. The Ambassador expressed doubt whether it would be possible to
                            induct the recruits and train them with dummy guns. He feared that this
                            procedure would arouse ridicule and defeat the purpose of the
                            recruiting.</p>
                        <p>He informed me that he had forwarded to Habana the War Department’s offer
                            to sell the coast artillery and agreed that this material could be paid
                            for by means of the existing lend-lease allotment.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation the Ambassador described the desire of the Cubans
                            to be of real assistance in the war and not mere onlookers. He recalled
                            that in the last war the Cuban Government had sent to Florida for
                            military training about 25,000 recruits. <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281"
                                facs="0295"/>Transportation problems make such a procedure difficult
                            at present, and the Cuban Government is therefore obliged to train its
                            recruits locally.</p>

                                    Ambassador points out the fact that as a result of the present
                                    political situation in Cuba, it is not possible to state when
                                    negotiations concerning the General Agreement can be resumed.
                                    The Ambassador further stated that he was willing to attempt to
                                    obtain action from the Government of Cuba on the Camagüey
                                    construction as a separate project if this step were considered

                        <p>A–129. The Navy Department has informed the Department that it desires to
                            obtain in the vicinity of the Guantánamo Naval Base two sites to be used
                            as landing fields for the training of carrier based planes. Two sites
                            have been selected as being most desirable for the purpose. The first of
                            these consists of about 448 acres and is located on the lands of the
                            Guantánamo Sugar Company adjoining the Central Los Canos Narrow Gauge
                            Railroad in Los Canos. The second consists of about 300 acres and is
                            situated on the La Verdad property of the Guantánamo Railroad near the
                            railroad station and village of Novaliches. The Navy Department
                            understands that the Guantánamo Sugar Company will be willing to lease
                            the desired portion of its property at a nominal rent for an indefinite
                            period.</p>

                            completed by February, 1943. Ten thousand five hundred men are now
                            employed, and the first runway was completed several days ago, the first
                            landing thereon being made on October 17. An informal joint
                            Cuban-American ceremony was held the following day during which the
                            Cuban and the American flags were raised. It is planned to have a formal
                            dedication on the field at a later date. Construction is now rapidly

                        </p>
                        <p>This is a small port about ten miles west of San Julián where a ramp to
                            handle seaplanes and accommodations for a detachment of approximately
                            100 men, together with communications facilities, are being established.
                            Work on this project, together with a highway connecting La Fé with
                            Mendoza, is being undertaken by the Frederick Snare Corporation. The
                            project represents an investment of approximately $250,000 and when
                            visited by a member of the Embassy staff last week appeared to be
                            approximately 80 per cent completed.</p>

                        <p>The Navy maintains a patrol detachment of approximately 150 officers and
                            men and 19 airplanes at the present San Julián field. The detachment has
                            operated from San Julián since last June and appears to be performing an
                            outstandingly good job, for which much credit is due to the commanding
                            officer, Lieutenant John M. Ennis. The excellent relations existing
                            between this detachment and the Cuban authorities in Pinar del Río have
                            been a source of sincere gratification to the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>The Navy has recently awarded a contract to the Frederick Snare
                            Corporation for the extension and improvement of the small landing field
                            at this port, which serves the Matahambre copper mines. Improvement of
                            the Santa Lucía field will add to the security of operations from San

                        <p>It is proposed to recondition the abandoned landing field near Santa Fé,
                            since the Presidio field has several nearby hills which would add to the
                            hazard of night flying. The present plan is to station one officer and
                            approximately 15 enlisted men at Santa Fé for service communications and
                            fuel, thus expanding the range of operations of the San Julián squadron.

                                inefficiency of the existing waterworks in supplying merchant ships,
                                and the vulnerability of Habana to bombing and epidemics.</note> and
                            they have been brought to the attention of officials of the interested
                            agencies of the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0305"/>
                        <p>As you are well aware, I have long been interested in the problem of the
                            Habana waterworks and share your belief that its reconstruction and
                            extension constitute a project of public works of great importance.
                            There exist in the various agencies of the Government of the United
                            States a full appreciation of the economic and social benefits to be
                            derived from the project, and a sympathetic desire to cooperate to the
                            fullest extent practicable with you in carrying it out.</p>
                        <p>There are two principal types of considerations involved in such
                            cooperation. The first is of course the working out of satisfactory
                            financial and technical arrangements for handling the project. I
                            understand that you have discussed these at some length with the
                            President of the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Warren Lee Pierson, and you are
                            in broad general agreement with respect to the matter. I am informed by
                            Mr. Pierson that upon the receipt from you of a letter regarding the
                            form of financial cooperation he will be able to give you his specific
                            suggestions and comments.</p>
                        <p>The other type of consideration is even more important in these days in
                            which the decision to allocate materials to any project must be based
                            upon the degree to which the project will contribute to our common major
                            objective, the winning of the war. I refer of course to the priority
                            rating which must be obtained from the War Production Board if the
                            materials and equipment to complete the project are to be made
                            available. The Department will make every effort to insure that the
                            production agency gives appropriate consideration to the strategic and
                            other aspects of the project. Preliminary consideration of the project
                            has already taken place, and as additional detailed information
                            regarding the materials required is received, the Department will be in
                            a position to press for a decision.</p>
                        <p>It was a great pleasure for me to see you again on your recent visit and
                            to have an opportunity to discuss matters of common interest.</p>
                        <p>With my kindest personal regards, believe me,</p>
                        <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador called this afternoon accompanied by the Minister of
                            Finance and by the Secretary of the Presidency, Senior López Castro.</p>
                        <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0306"/>
                        <p>Señor López Castro said he was the bearer of a message of a personal
                            character for me from President Batista. He said that President Batista
                            had agreed to conclude negotiations for the $25,000,000 credit because
                            of his belief that the various projects which would be carried out under
                            the terms of this credit would be highly beneficial to the people of
                            Cuba. He emphasized particularly the repair and the widening of the
                            Central Highway, the construction of feeder roads by the Department of
                            Agriculture, the new water systems in Santiago and Guantánamo, and
                            finally the construction of four hospitals, two of them to be completed
                            in the two cities last mentioned, upon which the heart of President
                            Batista was particularly set. He said that he had only two years left of
                            his presidential term and that he felt a moral obligation to the people
                            of Cuba to complete these hospitals before he left the Presidency.</p>
                        <p>President Batista continued by saying that public opinion was
                            overwhelmingly in favor of the conclusion of this credit arrangement but
                            that, knowing the Cuban people as I did, I would realize the serious
                            situation which would be created for him if after this credit
                            arrangement had been concluded none of the material from the United
                            States required for the construction of these projects was received
                            because of the lack of the necessary priorities.</p>
                        <p>President Batista therefore wanted me to know that he did not consider
                            that he could conclude the negotiations unless he felt that I was
                            personally interested in seeing that the material required reached Cuba
                            and unless because of my personal interest the question of the
                            priorities involved would be dealt with in other than the ordinary
                            routine way.</p>
                        <p>I asked Señor López Castro to reply in my name to President Batista in
                            these terms: I said that as he knew, I had always been greatly
                            interested in the extension of this credit to Cuba because of the fact
                            that when the negotiations commenced Cuba appeared to be heading into a
                            very serious economic situation and I felt that the assistance which
                            would be given to Cuba’s national economy by this credit would be enough
                            to relieve the situation almost entirely. I said that I believed that
                            the projects the Cuban Government had in mind were all of them desirable
                            and of long term, highly beneficial, permanent value. I said that
                            consequently there was no question but that my own personal interest was
                            involved and that for reasons of high policy, it would remain the desire
                            of this Government to see that as much of the material called for was
                            sent to Cuba as could be sent under our present situation in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I stated, however, that if the President’s message implied some
                            commitment on my part that priorities would be granted for such material
                            to be shipped, it was utterly impossible for me to give such <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0307"/>commitment. I said that this country
                            was involved in the most desperate war in which we had ever been engaged
                            and that the people and the Government of Cuba were at our side as our
                            allies in that war. I said that obviously, if the material required for
                            the carrying out of these projects in Cuba was required for our war
                            effort or for military or naval purposes, it would be fantastic to
                            assume that reasons of high policy, even a policy involving our Cuban
                            ally, could dissuade the President and the military and naval
                            authorities of the United States Government from utilizing these
                            materials for our war needs rather than for the construction of these
                            projects in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I said I wanted to speak with complete clarity and with complete
                            precision as I had always attempted to do in the past to my Cuban
                            friends so that there would be no possible misunderstanding in the
                            future: If our war needs and the needs of our general hemispheric policy
                            made it possible, it would be the desire of this Government to see that
                            the necessary priorities were granted but that I must emphasize the
                            tremendous demands which were increasingly being made upon us for our
                            war needs and for the requirements of our hemispheric policy and I
                            could, therefore, give no assurances of a more positive character to the
                            President of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador and the two cabinet ministers stated that this was
                            all they expected to obtain from me in the way of assurances and the
                            Cuban Ambassador asked if he could not also assume that Cuba would have
                            some preferential position with regard to these priorities in connection
                            with the requirements of the other American Republics.</p>
                        <p>I replied that it was impossible for me to give such assurances and that
                            I had already indicated that the requirements of our hemispheric policy
                            covered not only what we felt it necessary to give in a spirit of
                            fairness on terms of equality in the way of export allocations to our
                            neighbors in the rest of the hemisphere, but that also obviously some of
                            these priorities granted the other American Republics had a direct and
                            immediate connection with our war requirements and with the defense
                            requirements of the rest of the hemisphere. For example, I said, it
                            might well be that priorities for a governmental steel mill in Brazil
                            would be regarded as having a more direct connection with hemispheric
                            defense than the granting of priorities for the pipe required in the
                            aqueduct in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>I reiterated that all that I could possibly say was that these priorities
                            to Cuba were regarded with sympathy and with particular interest, but
                            that no assurances whatever, for the reasons above stated, could be
                            given that priorities would be forthcoming.</p>

                        <p>At a meeting called by Mr. Pierson in his office on May 12, Señor Puente
                            went over the plans he had prepared with Señor José García Montes for
                            the rehabilitation of the Habana water system. His plan which has been
                            drawn up over a period of years, contemplates the establishment of two
                            new sources of water, in addition to the existing Albear Aqueduct. It is
                            proposed to use no materials requiring priorities except a certain
                            amount of reinforcing rods for the first 18 to <pb n="295"
                                xml:id="pg_295" facs="0309"/>24 months of the project. This
                            preliminary work might result in an increased supply to the system but
                            this possibility was not made completely clear.</p>
                        <p>After the meeting Mr. Pierson mentioned that the Bank plans to send Mr.
                            Pirnie to Habana in accordance with Item 2 of Page 1 of the attached
                            copy of a draft letter to Dr. Menocal from the Bank.<note n="60"

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Pirnie indicated a familiarity with the Habana water system,
                            gathered, I judge, from a previous trip during the administration of Dr.
                                Mendieta.<note n="61" xml:id="d325fn61">Carlos Mendieta was
                                President of Cuba, 1934–35.</note> He spoke of the desirability of
                            ascertaining what the distribution system in Habana could accomplish if
                            sufficient water were made available. He mentioned that he knew of some
                            eight or ten plans that had been prepared to rehabilitate the system,
                            and suggested informally his own belief that a well field could be
                            established to the east of the present source to bring to Palatino about
                            150,000,000 gallons of water. From that point a turbine pump system
                            could carry the necessary quantity of water to a projected reservoir at
                            Víbora, which, owing to its elevation, would provide sufficient pressure
                            for the higher points in the City. Mr. Pirnie visualizes the new source
                            of water as supplementary to existing supplies.<note n="62"

                            today. This document discusses and presents a draft-law to create: <list>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Also it proposes to reform Cuban monetary and banking
                            laws with a view to eliminating the dollar as legal tender in this
                            country within 180 days or less if the Government so elects.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that the enactment of legislation along these
                            lines has been under consideration for some time and that finally the
                            creation of a central bank was definitely provided for in Article 142
                                (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) of the 1940 Constitution. During these
                            protracted discussions, <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0311"/>it has
                            come to be accepted as well nigh axiomatic that reforms such as are
                            contemplated in this draft legislation were required for the proper
                            functioning of banking in Cuba. Irrespective of whether or not this be
                            so, I understand and sympathize with Cuban ambitions to improve credit
                            facilities and to have their own currency as the sole legal tender. On
                            the other hand, in accomplishing these ends, the utmost care should be
                            taken to insure against mistakes—either in the planning or carrying out
                            of the desired measures—which might prove disastrous to this country and
                            indirectly to our interests here and to our commercial and other
                            relations with Cuba. Hence, it is of the utmost importance that the
                            proposed legislation should only be enacted into law after the most
                            exhaustive investigation possible of all the pertinent facts and
                            influences and that, in particular, certain conditions and psychologies,
                            peculiar to Cuba, be so thoroughly understood and such protection
                            thereon be incorporated in the law as to insure the successful operation
                            of the new system to be created.</p>

                            recommendation made by the American Technical Mission to Cuba, headed by

                            Treasury Department, will probably become law unless: <list>

                        </p>
                        <p>Self-evidently, the American Technical Mission could not properly enter
                            into those unfortunate features of Cuban character and malfeasance in
                            public office, which, nevertheless, of necessity, must be entirely
                            excluded from the new banking and monetary system if it is to function
                            honestly and effectively. It is for this reason that, quite apart from
                            the purely technical aspects of the pending legislation, I feel that the
                            following observations merit the Department’s careful consideration:</p>
                        <p>(1) There should be accurately determined just how much truth there is in
                            the widespread allegations that the lack of commercial credit and
                            rediscount facilities and the existing monetary system are responsible
                            for the financial and economic difficulties which have arisen in this
                            country during the last two decades. If these generalizations are not
                            entirely factual, it would appear unwise to rush through the basic
                            changes now under contemplation. But even if they are accurate, it does
                            not necessarily follow that the only solutions are those outlined in the
                            draft of law presented to Congress by President Batista. So far as I
                            have been able to ascertain, a careful <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298"
                                facs="0312"/>analysis and report on this underlying situation has
                            not been made. Therefore, it would seem logical for a meticulous study
                            of all the facts to be concluded first so that, based thereon, the best
                            possible solutions could be explored and then adopted.</p>
                        <p>(2) President Batista’s statement that the present is the most propitious
                            time for the enactment of this legislation is perhaps exact from the
                            viewpoint that the financial and economic problems which will arise
                            during the next few years will be so difficult as to require the best of
                            talent and the most solid banking, credit and monetary structures for
                            their proper solution. I am not convinced, however, that the present
                            period, when the entire world is in a state of flux and uncertainty and
                            so many unknown factors are appearing daily, is propitious for the
                            inauguration of a new banking and monetary system. On the contrary, it
                            might be preferable during the next few years to continue with the
                            existing media rather than to attempt to change systems in
                            midstream.</p>
                        <p>(3) Unless consummated with “superior skill”, the elimination of the
                            dollar as legal tender and the creation of the stabilization fund might
                            complicate the Cuban financial structure and prejudice trade with the
                            United States. Simplification in these matters would seem preferable
                            rather than the enactment of measures which will probably involve the
                            establishment of an exchange control, thus adding this country to the
                            long list of those which now have the freedom of their international
                            trade hampered by such measures. Finally, this would appear to be
                            another step away from the ideal of, if not a common currency for the
                            entire Hemisphere, at least complete stability of currencies between the
                            American republics.</p>
                        <p>While the Prime Minister, in a conversation with me, stated that it was
                            intended to tie the peso irrevocably to the dollar, it would not appear
                            from the draft law that this has been accomplished. Pending the
                            development of more definite plans to reach this very desirable end, it
                            might be preferable to carry on under the existing media which at least
                            in this particular have worked reasonably well until now. In fact, the
                            outstanding weakness which appears to exist in Cuban currency is the
                            extraction therefrom of large seigniorage profits during the last
                            several years. In any case, to force such a momentous change within a
                            180–day period or less does seem precipitous.</p>
                        <p>(4) President Batista’s message to Congress points out that the draft
                            legislation is largely based on the report of the White Mission.
                            Therefore, if, in the future, difficulties are encountered, irrespective
                            of what may be their cause, the United States Government will in all
                            probability be blamed.</p>
                        <p>(5) That Government should control banking and currency is a sound
                            postulate providing it can furnish competent and honest management. <pb
                                n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0313"/>If this cannot be done, then
                            some other control should be created. As the report of the White Mission
                            states: “A poorly administered central bank or stabilization fund would
                            add greatly to the difficulties that already exist.” When I informally
                            mentioned to the Prime Minister, Dr. Saladrigas, that honest and
                            competent management was a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for the
                            successful operation of the proposed bank, the only assurance he could
                            give me, that there would be such management, was that Dr. Oscar García
                            Montes, until recently Minister of the Treasury, and Sr. Eduardo
                            Durruthy, of that Ministry, would be the top executives of the new
                            institution for at least five years. …</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, honest and competent administration in
                            Government-controlled organizations has been and is a rarity in Cuba.
                            The new system by law will be politically controlled throughout.
                            Therefore, on this country’s record, it would seem overly optimistic to
                            hope for a “superior administration”. Without such an administration
                            there is at least an even chance that there will be costly mistakes,
                            difficulties and possibly illicit practices which may be disastrous in
                            many directions. To launch a fundamentally important new system under
                            these conditions is, to say the least, hazardous.</p>
                        <p>(6) As the report of the White Mission states, “care should be taken to
                            protect the (member) banks against loss of principal on their
                            subscriptions to the central bank”. Aside from the very serious problem
                            involved in obtaining a competent and honest administration for the
                            bank, the capital investment—and for that matter all other assets—might
                            be imperiled by: <list>

                                    strain, political influences have played havoc with central
                                    banks in such places as Chile, and the history of Cuba gives no
                                    encouragement that conditions would be any better here. For
                                    instance, here there are no really important national banks
                                    which could exercise a beneficial restraint on the central
                                    bank.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The volume and potency of corruption in Cuba induces the fear
                                    that illicit influences will endeavor to milk the institution
                                    for selfish ends. So frequently do attempts of this nature arise
                                    here that the Embassy has to be eternally vigilant to protect
                                    our interests against the effects of these evil practices. A
                                    most recent example is the maneuver to alter the <hi

                                    percent of the average of the current and the last preceding
                                    year’s budgets. However, it is pertinent to observe that, based
                                    on the present budget of 89,000,000 pesos, the Government could
                                    borrow up to 8,900,000 or 78 per cent in excess of the paid-in

                        <p>(7) This new legislation involves the enactment of additional taxation
                            which seems especially unfortunate at a period such as the present, when
                            the country’s income may be reduced and other heavy taxation be imposed

                        <p>I heartily approve of inspiring people to accept responsibility, by
                            giving them responsibility, but I question the wisdom of this policy
                            being pursued in Cuba at this time on so vital a matter as this, on
                            which depend the economy of the country and the happiness and well-being
                            of its citizens. If there had been in recent years a reasonably long
                            period of competent and honest administration by Governmental
                            organizations in Cuba, then the experiment might be justified, but under
                            existing circumstances, it seems perilous and, unfortunately, if it does
                            not work out successfully, the Department of State, the White Mission
                            and, therefore, the United States Government will probably be made the
                            whipping boy.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped, therefore, that very careful consideration of the
                            project will be given by the Cuban Congress and, in particular, that the
                            public hearings thereon will lead to a thorough analysis of all factors,
                            including the aforementioned. …</p>
                        <p>The Department will observe that in my opinion the recommendations of the
                            White Mission would prove most valuable under other conditions and with
                            the guidance of experienced technicians. But since this talent is,
                            unfortunately, unavailable here, I can only view with misgivings the
                            inauguration of a new banking and monetary system at this difficult and
                            uncertain period, in a country where practically all
                            governmentally-dominated enterprises are saturated with self-seeking
                            political influences which all too frequently lead to inefficiency and
                            even corruption.</p>

                        <p>The following comments are numbered to correspond with the numbered
                            paragraphs in the Embassy’s despatch No. 513 of July 20, 1942:</p>
                        <p>(1) The implication of this paragraph is that the American Technical
                            Mission did not devote sufficient study to whatever defects may exist in
                            the Cuban monetary and banking system and did not sufficiently explore
                            alternative solutions to these defects other than those recommended by
                            the Mission in its report. I have heard Mr. Harry White state
                            categorically that the mission was undertaken only on the specific
                            understanding that the Mission would be free to report on Cuban monetary
                            and banking needs as actual study disclosed them to the Mission and
                            further that the Mission would not recommend a central bank for Cuba
                            unless such an institution seemed to be required. I see little or no
                            reason to believe that the personnel of the Mission, which is of
                            unquestioned competence, did not make a thorough and conscientious study
                            and did not recommend the specific institutions and reforms which
                            represented the best judgment of the Mission as a whole. It seems a
                            little unreal to assume that a more thorough investigation of Cuba’s
                            needs in these matters would ever be undertaken by equally qualified
                            personnel if the Department undertook to torpedo the Mission’s report
                            and recommendations on a theory that a better report would be submitted
                            if more thorough or realistic study went into its preparation.</p>
                        <p>(2) In spite of the flux and uncertainty existing throughout the world
                            because of the war it would nevertheless appear that the present <pb
                                n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0316"/>is a propitious time for the
                            institution of monetary and banking reforms. The Mission in its report
                            specifically took cognizance of the probability that there would be a
                            heavy net influx of dollar payments into Cuba and recommended measures
                            to limit the inflationary repercussions of this on the Cuban economy.
                            (See <ref target="#pg_62">pages 62</ref>–<ref target="#pg_63">63</ref>
                            of the Second Report to the Cuban Government) The Mission estimates that
                            the favorable trade balance of Cuba during the coming year might exceed
                            $100 million and mentions the $25 million Export-Import Bank credit and
                            the $20 million Reconstruction Finance Corporation advance for the
                            development of nickel deposits. In addition, as I understand it, Cuba
                            may derive a large amount of dollars from various military projects
                            which are getting under way in that area. From the point of view of
                            anticipated dollar influx into Cuba it would be hard to envisage a more
                            propitious time than the present for the institution of these
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>(3) In view of the considerations set forth in (2) there seems to be no
                            reason to assume that the establishment of a stabilization fund and
                            elimination of the dollar as legal tender will straightway plunge Cuba
                            into an exchange control regime unless the Cuban Government blandly
                            disregards the advice of the Technical Mission and attempts a rapid
                            elimination of dollar deposits. The Mission has expressed its views on
                            the latter in both its Second and Fourth reports and if its
                            recommendations are followed apprehensions as to immediate adoption of
                            exchange control simply do not seem to be justified by the facts. It is
                            true that the Mission foresees certain contingencies under which an
                            exchange control might be necessary or desirable. The chief of these
                            contingencies would be an economic crisis which arose from a collapse of
                            Cuban exports and acute disequilibrium in the Cuban balance of payments.
                            I believe that many monetary authorities would agree that in such
                            conditions an exchange control is a lesser evil than the extreme and
                            uncontrolled deflation of the type experienced by Cuba during the
                            depression. One of the principal reasons for suggesting a Cuban central
                            bank and stabilization fund for Cuba is to provide Cuba with a mechanism
                            for coping with such a situation by its own monetary credit and
                            controls. Measures of this character obviously are doomed to failure so
                            long as Cuba has a dual monetary system and must remain blindly tied to
                            the dollar.</p>
                        <p>The Mission report clearly indicates an assumption that the peso will
                            remain closely tied to the dollar for some time to come. The Mission,
                            however, quite properly suggested mechanisms for dealing with emergency
                            situations and envisaged certain circumstances in which the change in
                            basic economic relations might make it inadvisable to continue to
                            maintain the peso at its existing parity with the dollar. Whether or not
                            the economic disadvantages and risks to Cuba of continuing <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0317"/>a dual monetary system exceed the risks
                            of the establishment in Cuba of mechanisms of currency and credit
                            control to deal with crisis situations is perhaps a matter of opinion.
                            It would not appear, however, that this Government could properly
                            attempt to deny to Cuba the sovereignty over these matters which is
                            enjoyed by all independent countries.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that it can be sustained that an establishment of its
                            own currency by Cuba conflicts in any way with our hemispheric monetary
                            policies nor do I think it reasonable to criticize a monetary system
                            because the government derives seigniorage profits from the issues of
                            currency. Practically all other governments derive seigniorage profits
                            directly or indirectly from the issue of money and it is little hard to
                            see why Cuba should be deprived of this normal adjunct of
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>(4) The point that this Government may be blamed for future Cuban
                            monetary difficulties because of the report of the Technical Mission
                            cannot, I believe, be given much weight. If it were, this Government
                            would refrain from offering advice to Cuba and this would appear
                            definitely to be a greater evil than undertaking to advise Cuba through
                            mechanisms such as the Technical Mission. Moreover, it should be readily
                            discernible what difficulties arise from following the advice of the
                            Mission and what difficulties follow from flat disregard of the
                            Mission’s recommendations.</p>
                        <p>(5) This is perhaps the essence of the Embassy’s objection to the
                            proposed central bank; namely that the new system will be politically
                            controlled and that the Cuban Government is incapable of providing
                            competent and honest management for the new system.</p>
                        <p>The trend of experience and developments during the past decade or so,
                            both in this country and abroad, has been such that it is unlikely that
                            any group not composed solely of private bankers or central bankers of
                            the more conservative type would recommend the establishment of a
                            central bank which would not be subject in major policy questions to
                            considerable if not predominant governmental influence. The view that
                            central banks should be above the government (i. e. “free from political
                            influence”) though dominant in the 1920’s has been pretty well
                            discredited during the 1930’s both by monetary theorists and the march
                            of political and economic events. Few countries will now tolerate any
                            large degree of central bank independence from basic policy
                            determinations by treasuries. Central banks have almost everywhere
                            become the tools or handmaidens of governments in the determination of
                            monetary policy rather than independent policy makers or even co-equals
                            in the making of policies. How governments can assume such a role
                            without subjecting central banks to “undue political influence” is not
                            easy to see. In any event <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0318"/>in
                            view of the present minor role occupied by purely Cuban financial
                            institutions the establishment of a central bank which would be
                            controlled by private banking interests rather than the Government would
                            appear to perpetuate in Cuba a degree of control over the banking system
                            by foreign bankers which the Cubans can hardly be expected to
                            accept.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances and bearing in mind this Government’s general
                            policies with respect to the American republics it would appear
                            difficult if not impossible for the Department to sustain against the
                            recommendations of the Technical Mission and the desires of the Cuban
                            Government the view that Cuba should continue indefinitely on a dual
                            monetary basis or accept a central bank which would be conspicuous among
                            its sister institutions by lack of government means to influence its
                            basic policies. It may well be that Cuba may be forced to learn from
                            bitter experience the consequences of illadvised monetary and central
                            banking policies or political interference with proper conduct of the
                            bank. As against this, however, there is at least the possibility that
                            the proposed reforms may remedy some of the outstanding defects of the
                            present system which flow from the complete lack of any mechanism for
                            centralized control of money and credit in Cuba. Moreover, I do not know
                            that one can wholly dismiss the possibility that the creation of these
                            new Cuban institutions may stimulate a greater sense of responsibility
                            on the part of the Cuban Government and informed public than has existed
                            under conditions of the past.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of this, however, from the fundamental policy point of view,
                            fears of the possible incapacity of the Cuban Government in these
                            matters would not, in my opinion, justify an attempt on the part of the
                            Department to prevent Cuba joining the vast majority of her sister
                            republics which have an independent currency and a central bank. In the
                            light of Cuban desires in this regard it seems to me that this
                            Government has followed the most proper policy; it has made available to
                            Cuba competent experts to advise that Government as to the type of
                            central bank and monetary system which it regards as most suited to
                            Cuba’s needs and will doubtless freely offer Cuba such technical advice
                            and assistance as the Government of that country may request. This
                            Government will also doubtless stand ready to assist the Cuban central
                            bank and stabilization fund in more material ways should the need arise
                            and the possibility of being able to justify requests for such material
                            assistance should operate as a restraining factor of no mean proportions
                            on Cuban management of these institutions.</p>
                        <p>There have doubtless been many errors and mistakes in the management and
                            operations of many of the central banks of the American <pb n="305"
                                xml:id="pg_305" facs="0319"/>Republics. However, I believe it would
                            be very difficult to sustain the thesis that these countries would have
                            been better off economically if they had been content to accept a dual
                            monetary system or to use the dollar exclusively rather than make some
                            attempt to control money and credit from the point of view of the
                            particular social and economic needs of each. Although inflation and
                            exchange control can be serious evils and bring serious abuses, it is
                            not clear that these have exceeded the evils which would have followed
                            abandonment of national efforts at control in favor of a blind linking
                            of the local currency to the dollar and maintenance at all costs of
                            freedom of exchange.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is difficult to see why an exception should be made with
                            respect to monetary and banking matters in the exercise of sovereignty
                            by an American republic. The establishment of its own monetary system by
                            Cuba is as much a prerogative of Cuban sovereignty as the establishment
                            of its own army, police forces and courts. Perhaps Cuba would be better
                            off if it used American armed forces and police and paid us therefor
                            just as economically it pays us when it uses United States currency. I
                            do not see how we could possibly object to the establishment by Cuba of
                            its own independent monetary system without doing violence to our basic
                            political policies toward Cuba. This is not to say that we should remain
                            silent if Cuba goes about it in a way which will not only unreasonably
                            damage American interests but will seriously injure Cuba as well. It is
                            to say, however, that the Department should not attempt to dissuade Cuba
                            from following the advice and recommendations of the Technical Mission
                            merely because of the possibility of Cuban political incapacity.</p>
                        <p>(6) (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The mere fact that the government may
                            over-borrow from the bank in times of duress hardly seems sufficient
                            reason for not having any central bank at all. In citing the experience
                            of Chile in this regard or in citing experience of other Latin American
                            countries one must always give consideration to the disastrous results
                            that might have occurred in many instances had the central banks not
                            taken action to counter extremely deflationary pressures. In many cases
                            depreciation of the currency has doubtless provided a safety valve and
                            means of adjustment for relieving intolerable social and economic
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) This point appears to be a facet of the
                            general discussion of political interference discussed at greater length
                            in point (5) of the Embassy’s despatch.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) It is admittedly difficult to frame legal
                            provisions which will prevent governments from using central bank credit
                            as a convenient substitute for revenues from taxation and which will at
                            the same time permit legitimate ordinary and crisis borrowing by the
                            government <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0320"/>from the central
                            bank. The Cuban legislation seems hardly as radical as our own emergency
                            legislation which gave the President power to order the Federal Reserve
                            banks to buy $5 billion of Government bonds. In any event too rigorous
                            legal limitation on the ability of a central bank to extend credit to a
                            government merely results in a change in the law when the need arises or
                            the development of some convenient subterfuge which permits the
                            government to walk right through such restraints. The Technical Mission
                            very distinctly and forcefully points out the dangers of over-borrowing
                            by the government. The various restraints and limitations suggested by
                            the Mission are about all that can be reasonably expected in the
                            circumstances, keeping in mind the predominantly agricultural character
                            of Cuba and the lack of Cuban-owned financial institutions.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) In all probability the Cuban central bank for
                            sometime will not be able to engage in important open market operations.
                            Even without a broad open market, however, the bank and the
                            stabilization fund should be able to function effectively and perform
                            many useful functions.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The mere fact that it may be abused would not
                            seem adequate reason for depriving the central bank of this necessary
                            emergency power.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) There is no compelling reason for maintaining
                            a 100 per cent reserve behind money. The fiduciary issue of the Bank of
                            England is a case in point. The legal maximum of notes regarded as the
                            fiduciary issue has been raised again and again as Great Britain has
                            become more or less permanently adjusted to a larger monetary
                            circulation. The Mission’s report is, as I understand it, based on the
                            theory that Cuba should in all probability in no event permit a
                            deflation which would reduce the monetary circulation below the quantity
                            of peso currency now outstanding. Based on this assumption it suggests
                            that no reserves be required for such currency but that reserves be
                            required only against increases in circulation above this amount. An
                            approach of this type is perhaps more widely acceptable to students of
                            monetary matters than the more archaic and conservative banking idea
                            that all currency should be backed 100 per cent by reserves.</p>
                        <p>(7) The fact that the new central bank may occasion some increase in
                            Cuban taxation would appear to be a valid objection to the establishment
                            of the central bank only if it is assumed that the central bank would
                            not benefit Cuba sufficiently to justify its cost. It is clearly the
                            assumption of the Technical Mission that this is not the case, and I
                            believe that the Department would agree with the Technical Mission on
                            this point.</p>

                            513, dated July 20, 1942, concerning the establishment of a central bank
                            and stabilization fund in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware the Cuban Government has long been interested in
                            terminating the dependence of Cuba on dollar currency and in
                            establishing in Cuba an independent monetary system and appropriate
                            institutions for the control of money and credit. The Department has
                            recognized not only the need for such institutions in Cuba but also that
                            the wishes of the Cuban Government with respect to these matters
                            represented the legitimate aspirations of an independent country. In
                            response to the request of the Cuban Government, the Department was
                            accordingly glad to use its good offices in obtaining for Cuba the
                            services of highly competent experts of the Treasury Department and the
                            Federal Reserve System to study Cuba’s monetary and credit needs and to
                            make appropriate recommendations to the Cuban Government.</p>
                        <p>The report of the American Technical Mission to Cuba has been carefully
                            studied in the Department and the Department was given an opportunity to
                            express its views to the members of the Technical Mission before the
                            report was submitted in final form to the Cuban Government. As the
                            Embassy knows the report was transmitted through this Department to the
                            Cuban Government and presumably therefore had the general approval of
                            the Department.</p>
                        <p>The basic policy of this Government toward the establishment of the Cuban
                            central bank and stabilization fund has thus already been determined;
                            namely, to assist Cuba in every appropriate way, particularly by the
                            providing of technical advice and assistance. It would not be in
                            accordance with the fundamental policies of the Department with respect
                            to Cuba and to the other American republics in general to attempt to
                            delay the establishment of the Cuban central bank and stabilization fund
                            merely because of the possibility that such institutions, however well
                            designed, might not be properly managed. Were this not the case it
                            should be apparent that the Department would have long since advanced
                            its objections rather than wait to make such objections until a
                            technical mission composed of officials of other agencies of this
                            Government had submitted their report through the Department to the
                            Cuban Government and that Government had prepared draft legislation on
                            the basis of the recommendations contained therein.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of the Department that the appropriate course for the
                            Embassy to follow with respect to the legislation under reference <pb
                                n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0322"/>would be for the Embassy to
                            support informally and as occasion may arise the basic recommendations
                            of the American Technical Mission, particularly when the proposed
                            legislation is in conflict with the specific recommendations of the
                            Technical Mission and where such departures from the Mission’s
                            recommendations would appear likely to work undue hardships on American
                            banks and indirectly on Cuba’s own basic interests. In this connection
                            the Department refers you specifically to the Fourth Report to the Cuban
                            Government under date of July 15, 1942, “Comments on the Draft Banking
                            Legislation.” The Embassy might on suitable occasion, for example, draw
                            the attention of appropriate Cuban officials to the views of the Mission
                            with respect to the powers granted to the Inspector General of Private
                            Banking in Titles 4 and 5, (see <ref target="#pg_19">page 19</ref>), and
                            to the comments of the Mission with respect to Title 5, chapter 2,
                            article 16, requiring 40 per cent of the profits of commercial banks to
                            be turned into a contingent reserve, (<ref target="#pg_21">page
                            21</ref>). Similarly, your attention is called to the provisions
                            discussed on pages 22 and 23 relating to restrictions on investment
                            abroad and measures which in the opinion of the Mission would impede
                            unduly the use of dollar deposits.</p>
                        <p>The Department shares your hope that the proposed legislation will be
                            carefully considered by the Cuban Congress and that opportunity will be
                            given by public hearings for interested parties to express their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed for your information a copy of a memorandum prepared in

                        <p>Lieutenant Southard called on Mr. Livesey to discuss with him the
                            former’s brief sojurn in Habana during which he was prepared to <pb
                                n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0323"/>discuss with Cuban officials,
                            the Embassy or other interested parties the pending Cuban central bank
                            and monetary legislation.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Southard said that for no particular reason consideration of
                            the central bank project by the Cuban Congress had been deferred until
                            legislation relating to elections and the draft had been dealt with. He
                            estimated that the central bank legislation would not be considered
                            sooner than in ten days, probably not until a month or six weeks
                            elapsed. He remarked that there seemed to be a good deal of interest in
                            the central bank and that many Cuban groups and organizations had
                            prepared memoranda and briefs to be presented at the hearings which the
                            Cuban Congress had decided to hold on the legislation.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Southard said that he found that he could do very little at
                            Habana but talk with the Embassy, various private citizens, and a few
                            members of the Congress who belong to the opposition. He said that
                            apparently the Cuban Minister of Finance did not have a very clear idea
                            of the higher politics involved in the banking legislation and
                            consequently had played safe by suggesting to Mr. Durruthy<note n="68"
                                xml:id="d332fn68">Official of the Cuban Ministry of the

                                >Presumably the Cuban Sub-Secretary of Defense.</note> that perhaps
                            they had better not discuss these matters with Lieutenant Southard.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Southard said that the present banking and monetary bills had
                            been drafted before the Cuban Government had received the Technical
                            Mission’s Fourth Report expressing strong opposition to many features of
                            the bill. The Cuban experts who had been working with the Technical
                            Mission had wished to defer submitting a bill to the Cuban Congress
                            until the Technical Mission’s Report had been received, but
                            unfortunately Batista had informed them late in June that they must have
                            a bill ready within twenty-four hours. We agreed that this was
                            unfortunate since the Cuban Government would probably have found it much
                            easier to accept the Mission’s recommendations before it had presented
                            the bill than it would to accept the same suggestions at the apparent
                            instance of groups in Cuba who are on the whole unfavorable to the
                            central bank plan.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Southard said that he had talked with Mr. White of the
                            Treasury Department and that Mr. White had asked his advice as to what
                            should be done. Lieutenant Southard said that he had told Mr. White that
                            he thought there was nothing that could be done at this time. He said
                            that the Cuban Government might or might not ask for someone from the
                            Technical Mission to come to Habana for the proposed hearings on the
                            legislation and that he felt very strongly that no one from the
                            Technical Mission should go except in <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                facs="0324"/>response to a definite request by the Cuban Government
                            which had originated with that Government and had not been promoted or
                            stimulated by us. He also expressed some doubt as to how much good it
                            would do to send a member of the Mission even if a request should be
                            received. Such a person could actually do little but stand on the
                            Mission’s reports. The Cubans, however, might try to maneuver him into
                            acquiescing in serious departures from the Mission’s
                            recommendations.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            no. 513 of July 20, 1942, and to acknowledge the Department’s
                            instruction no. 499 of August 15, 1942, on the subject of proposed
                            banking and monetary legislation for Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s instructions have been noted and will, of course, as
                            always, be meticulously followed.</p>
                        <p>Hearings in Congress on the proposed legislation are scheduled to begin
                            shortly. The Habana Clearing House has submitted to the appropriate
                            Senate Committee a 26½ page objection to several fundamental aspects of
                            the draft law and has suggested alternative procedures. Two copies of
                            this document are enclosed herewith.<note n="70" xml:id="d333fn70">Not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I very much appreciated the opportunity afforded me to discuss this
                            matter with Lieutenant Southard during his visit to Habana, and since he
                            and I, in airgrams nos. A–87 and A–90 of August 19,<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d333fn71">Neither printed.</note> fully outlined what my
                            thoughts have been and are with respect to the proposed legislation, it
                            appears unnecessary for me now to extend my views to any great length.
                            Moreover, I trust that on Lieutenant Southard’s arrival in Washington,
                            his more detailed verbal account of my opinions and my conversations
                            with him may clarify both the Department’s and the Technical Mission’s
                            understandings in the premises. I do wish to emphasize, however, that my
                            despatch under reference was entirely in consonance with the
                            Department’s instructions—“to assist Cuba in every appropriate way”.</p>
                        <p>As Lieutenant Southard informed me here, the Technical Mission did not
                            study the political aspects of this matter, and therefore it did not go
                            into the repercussions which the widespread prevalence of <pb n="311"
                                xml:id="pg_311" facs="0325"/>corruption in Cuba might have on the
                            proposed banking and monetary reforms. These unique conditions of
                            corruption must inevitably have an important bearing on the success of
                            or failure of the pending legislation. Hence, I would have been
                            delinquent in my duties had I not warned the Department as I did in my
                            despatch no. 513.</p>
                        <p>In order that the record may be perfectly clear, the following additional
                            observations appear pertinent:</p>
                        <p>1. Never have I even implied that the Department “undertake to torpedo
                            the Mission’s report”. On the contrary, my ideas were submitted with a
                            view to insuring the successful operation of the program which was
                            recommended by the Mission.</p>
                        <p>2. With reference to numbered paragraph “1” of my despatch under
                            reference, and of the memorandum<note n="72" xml:id="d333fn72">Dated
                                August 3, <ref target="#pg_301">p. 301</ref>.</note> attached to the
                            Department’s instruction, I am glad to learn that the “underlying
                            situation” referred to by me was carefully studied by the Technical
                            Mission and I only regret that a detailed written report thereon does
                            not appear to have been prepared, since such an analysis, I know, would
                            have greatly assisted me to a better comprehension of the entire matter
                            and, no doubt, would be a valuable addition to the Department’s and this
                            Embassy’s files.</p>
                        <p>3. Whether or not the present time is propitious for the initiation of
                            monetary and banking reforms in Cuba, is a question of opinion. As
                            Lieutenant Southard has reported, I still feel that the inauguration of
                            these measures may advantageously be deferred, but I, of course, respect
                            and will follow the Department’s views in the premises. However, it
                            should be noted that Lieutenant Southard agreed with me that, under the
                            circumstances, this is a difficult decision to make. Therefore, I doubt
                            that he would so unreservedly express the opinion given in Article 2 of
                            the Department’s memorandum when it states that “the present is a
                            propitious time for the institution of monetary and banking reforms”. In
                            this connection, the memorandum in the same paragraph speaks of the
                            “heavy net influx of dollar payments into Cuba” and “the inflationary
                            repercussions of this on the Cuban economy”. The measure of inflation
                            which may or may not occur here would seem to depend more on the amount
                            of sugar which we purchase from Cuba than on the receipt of dollars from
                            our military projects, Nicaro Nickel, etc. If, as now seems likely,
                            sugar purchases are to be materially reduced for 1943 the
                            “repercussions” here might be deflationary since the flow of dollars
                            into Cuba on construction projects related to the war might not offset
                            the lesser amount of sugar purchased.</p>

                        <p>4. The Department’s memorandum, in Article 3, holds that there would seem
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“to be no reason to assume that the establishment of a
                                    stabilization fund and elimination of the dollar as legal tender
                                    will straightway plunge Cuba into an exchange control régime
                                    unless the Cuban Government blandly disregards the advice of the
                                    Technical Mission and attempts a rapid elimination of dollar
                                    deposits.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">The “rapid elimination of dollar deposits” apparently is
                            contemplated by the draft law, when it provides that dollar currency
                            will cease to be legal tender 180 days after the law’s promulgation or
                            sooner if the President deems it advisable. Moreover, the taxes provided
                            in the draft law, if enacted, would tend further to force the withdrawal
                            of dollar deposits. Thus, these two stipulations might be influences
                            working towards the establishment of “an exchange control régime” in
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>5. Admittedly, practically all, if not all, Governments derive
                            seigniorage profits from their issues of currency. The only question
                            which I wished to raise in my despatch under reference was the degree to
                            which this procedure may be carried safely in Cuba. I am glad to note
                            that the Department is entirely satisfied in this particular.</p>
                        <p>6. The observations made in Article 4 of the Department’s memorandum are
                            entirely accurate from a purely factual aspect, but the point, which I
                            should perhaps have made clearer in my despatch, was that in matters of
                            this kind, public and press discussions instead of being based on lucid,
                            honest expositions of fact are not infrequently characterized by
                            prejudice, and attempts to find a scapegoat which, in this instance, I
                            fear might be the Technical Mission and the Department.</p>
                        <p>7. There appears to be no fundamental difference in principle between the
                            views of Article 5 of the memorandum and of my despatch, wherein I began
                            with the statement: “That Government should control banking and currency
                            is a sound postulate providing it can furnish honest and competent
                            management”. As the memorandum accurately observes, the essence of my
                            objections to the proposed legislation is that I doubt whether the
                            Cubans presently are competent to furnish honest and able management and
                            that, as the Technical Mission reported, “a poorly administrated central
                            bank or stabilization fund would add greatly to the difficulties that
                            already exist”.</p>
                        <p>8. At the end of paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the Department’s memorandum,
                            the statement is made: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It would not appear, however, that this Government could

                        <p rend="flushleft">The last paragraph of Article 5 of the memorandum reads:

                        <p rend="flushleft">By these and other commentaries, the memorandum would
                            seem to imply that I have made suggestions which, if put into effect,
                            would be detrimental to Cuban sovereignty. I am astonished that any such
                            inference could have been drawn from my words. I am dedicated to the
                            principles and policies of our Government in these particulars. I
                            believe my record has always been forthright and clear on this and I can
                            see nothing, I repeat nothing, in my despatch under reference which in
                            the slightest could justify the memorandum’s misinterpretation of my
                            stand.</p>
                        <p>My thought that we might discreetly suggest to the Cuban Government that
                            the central bank-monetary legislation could be deferred to a more
                            propitious time is no more an impairment of this country’s sovereignty
                            than are any or all of the recommendations made in the several memoranda
                            prepared by the Technical Mission and in particular the Fourth Report
                            commenting on the draft law. Similarly my suggestion is no more an
                            infringement of Cuban sovereignty than is the antepenultimate paragraph
                            of the Department’s instruction no. 499</p>

                            of the conditions which might be contrary to the Technical Mission’s
                            admonition, “care should be taken to protect the (member) banks against
                            loss of principal on their subscriptions to the central bank”. For

                            here to exercise a beneficial restraint on the central bank. Also, in

                            Concheso concerning the following three projects evidently submitted to
                            the Cuban Embassy by the National Development Commission: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Repair of the Central Highway</item>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last two would appear to require 7,000 tons of scarce materials,
                            including pipe, valves, etc. At their first meeting with the Ambassador
                            Mr. Ravndal convinced him that it would be preferable at the start to
                            ascertain informally from the interested agencies of this Government of
                            the decision that might be expected if project applications were
                            received on a formal basis. This was done and it was indicated that all
                            three projects would be rejected, in view of the critical scarcity of
                            the necessary materials.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was, of course, deeply disappointed to learn of the
                            certain rejections. Mr. Ravndal and Mr. Edgar subsequently considered
                            the possibility of the Department’s backing the Guantánamo project on
                            the basis of a definite contribution to health and sanitation in the
                            area near the United States Naval Base. This was suggested as a
                            possibility to Ambassador Concheso with the indication that no definite
                            assurances could be given but that the Department would be glad to
                            cooperate with Cuba in working up the case on the basis of a revision of
                            the material requirements at first presented.</p>

                            the subsequent correspondence has resulted in a clear understanding by

                            policy with regard to the monetary and banking legislation and, in the

                        <p>54. The Cuban Government is faced with a difficult situation because of
                            the shortage of low grade alcohol for local consumption and the press is
                            filled with allegations that the Government in selling the sugar crop to
                            us failed to protect the interests of the Cuban people; alcohol being
                            “the poor man’s fuel”.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware 34,000,000 gallons of high test are reserved
                            in crop contract for domestic use and while the 9,000,000 gallons of
                            blackstrap also reserved would be approximately sufficient to produce
                            all Cuba’s 1942 alcohol requirements, the Cuban Government is reluctant
                            to reduce domestic blackstrap prices to a figure which would permit sale
                            of alcohol at around heretofore prevailing prices as it fears that any
                            reduction in molasses prices below the official sales price might cause
                            an unfavorable reaction in the United States. The 9,000,000 gallon
                            blackstrap volume is moreover reportedly not sufficient to permit
                            profitable operation of local distilleries.</p>
                        <p>I have been told therefore to place the following suggestion urgently
                            before our Government: Cuba is prepared to convert its 34,000,000
                            gallons of high test into approximately 20,000,000 gallons of <pb
                                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0330"/>190 proof industrial alcohol
                            (presumably at prevailing market prices and with a waiver of existing
                            United States duties). Local capacity is 1½ to 2 million gallons of such
                            alcohol per month and capacity could be reached in approximately 30
                            days.</p>
                        <p>While I am not unaware of the possible connection between this project
                            and previous efforts on the part of Cuban distillers to [apparent
                            omission] alcohol in the United States Mañas<note n="78"
                                xml:id="d336fn78">Arturo Manuel Mañas, representative of the sugar
                                mill owners.</note> informs me that by processing the 34,000,000
                            gallons of high test plus the 9,000,000 gallons of blackstrap economical
                            operation of local distilleries would permit production of fuel and
                            other alcohol for domestic use at prices low enough to solve existing
                            acute fuel alcohol problem. Mañas states that even on above basis plants
                            would operate at only 50% of capacity.</p>
                        <p>A telegraphic reply would be appreciated.</p>

                        <p>80. The question you raise in your 54, February 13, midnight, appears to
                            the Department to be an internal one stemming from the sale of Cuban
                            molasses at the price of the sugar content.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the Department is referring the question to the appropriate
                            agencies, including the Treasury, the Defense Supplies Corporation and
                            the War Production Board.</p>
                        <p>You may however be interested to know that the question of imported
                            foreign alcohol has recently been examined by the Department at the
                            instance of the Dominican Minister, under instructions, and of persons
                            describing themselves as representing Cuban distilling interests. The
                            Department has in the face of these approaches stated that the problem
                            is within the jurisdiction of the Treasury which has informed the
                            Department that foreign alcohol may not be withdrawn from bond for
                            denaturing without payment of the internal revenue tax.</p>
                        <p>It has been learned furthermore that persons allegedly speaking for Cuban
                            distillers who have discussed the possibility of selling Cuban alcohol
                            in the United States with other Government agencies have been informed
                            that the United States distilling industry is capable of manufacturing
                            our total requirements of alcohol provided raw materials are available
                            in a regular and adequate flow. In this connection you are informed that
                            distillers of beverage alcohol employing <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317"
                                facs="0331"/>domestic grains as raw material are beginning to
                            convert to industrial alcohol production. (Can you obtain an accurate
                            indication of Cuban alcohol capacity without new equipment?)</p>

                            already begun to create an unfavorable atmosphere among mill owners
                            whose problem is complicated because of the increase in wages and <hi
                                rend="italic">colono</hi> payments which cannot be deferred. Many
                                <hi rend="italic">hacendados</hi> are accordingly having to obtain
                            advances from the banks which are charging from 6 to 8 percent “against
                            the certainty of Defense Supplies Corporation payments” which rates
                            López Castro considers indefensible. He added that the matter had been
                            taken up with the Habana clearing house with no success whatever and
                            that he proposed to bring it to the attention of the Acting
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that the Cuban Government and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >hacendados</hi> sold the crop at a reasonable price to our
                            Government not in the expectation of large profits to producers but in
                            furtherance of the war effort; that being the case he fails to see why
                            the banks should be demanding “inordinate profits” from a situation
                            resulting from the shipping problem, over which Cuba has no control.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to previous correspondence
                            concerning the 1942 Cuban sugar crop, and in particular to my telegram
                            no. 102 of March 4, 12 noon, I have the honor to enclose for the
                            confidential information of the Department a copy of the memorandum of
                            the conversation<note n="82" xml:id="d339fn82">Not printed.</note> on
                            March 10 with Mr. Peter Schellens, Vice President of the National City
                            Bank of New York, and Mr. Carter, Manager of the Habana Branch of that
                            bank. Mr. Schellens has apparently come to Habana following receipt of
                            an intimation by the head office in New York that the Cuban Government
                            is dissatisfied with the high rates allegedly charged by the banks for
                            advances to assist in financing the grinding of the crop.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that my callers denied that rates higher than six
                            percent are being asked by the National City Bank, but admitted that
                            amounts charged certain Cuban mills may be twice as large as the
                            interest which American companies are having to pay (i.e. 3%). This
                            factor alone would seem to be sufficient to explain the attitude shown
                            last week by Señor Amadeo López Castro, reported in my telegram
                            mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>The Department will also note that the National City Bank is apparently
                            considering the possibility of offering credit accommodation for crop
                            financing to the Cuban Sugar Stabilization Institute,<note n="83"

                                [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>], Investigation reveals that at least one
                            of the three American banks here is in fact charging up to 8% on
                            advances in conjunction with the present sugar crop notwithstanding the
                            security provided by the crop sale contract with the American
                            Government. <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0333"/>It also seems
                            established that the mills paying the lowest rate (3% to 4%) include
                            many American owned mills (and those with special bank relationships
                            such as General Sugar Estates with National City Bank; Atlántica del
                            Golfo and Punta Alegre with Chase, et cetera) whereas mills paying
                            highest rates are mostly Cuban. Representative of Boston bank states
                            that most of his clients are being accommodated at 4% to 5% he having
                            only one loan above the latter figure and that at 6%.</p>
                        <p>Admitting that there are various factors involved including the absence
                            of war risk insurance on sugar in Cuba, nevertheless I do not find
                            convincing the explanation made by the bankers and the impression
                            persists that at least two of the American banks are trying to charge
                            all the traffic will bear. In any case the attitude of López Castro
                            described in my telegram No. 102 and reflected since then in various
                            conversations with other officials would appear to have considerable
                            justification.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the pending request of
                            Defense Supplies Corporation that the proportion of the sugar crop to be
                            produced as invert be reduced from the equivalent of 1,200,000 tons to
                            the equivalent of 700,000 tons, I have the honor to report that a number
                            of mills have inquired whether there is any penalty involved at present
                            for failing to produce the proportions indicated in the contract
                            (two-thirds raw sugar, one-third invert). In this connection the
                            Institute has informed the Hacendados Association as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That there is no penalty against a mill which fails to make part
                                    of its crop in the form of invert molasses;</p>
                                <p>That the mill which makes more than the corresponding amount of
                                    invert “may be penalized or may encounter difficulties”;</p>
                                <p>That a company which controls two or more mills cannot produce a
                                    smaller proportion of invert in one mill in order to make a
                                    larger proportion in another. (This decision is of considerable
                                    importance to a number of companies, including Hershey and
                                    Compañía Azucarera Atlántica del Golfo, which assert that it
                                    would be more efficient and more economical for them to make
                                    their entire amount of invert in one mill and to devote the
                                    others exclusively to the production of raw sugar and
                                    blackstrap.)</p>

                        <p>The question of reducing the proportion of invert is already becoming of
                            urgent importance to many mills which are approaching the 67% mark, at
                            which, under the original crop sale contract and under existing Cuban
                            decrees promulgated pursuant thereto, they should switch to invert
                            production. Although the request of Defense Supplies Corporation is of
                            course now known by all producers, the delay in reaching final agreement
                            as to the amendment of the contract has similarly delayed the issue of a
                            new decree changing the proportions to 80%–20%. It is not improbable
                            that some mills may switch to the production of invert, whereas others,
                            taking it for granted that the contract will be amended as above, may
                            continue with the production of raw sugar up to the anticipated 80%
                            limit. Still others, such as Senator Casanova’s<note n="84"
                                xml:id="d341fn84">José M. Casanova, president, Cuban Sugar
                                Stabilization Institute.</note> Central Orozco, are understood to
                            have produced no raw sugar whatever thus far; should they continue with
                            invert production, some adjustments will subsequently have to be made.
                            There are of course certain unfortunate possibilities inherent in such a
                            situation, and it is accordingly of the utmost importance that an
                            agreement as to the amendment of the contract be reached at the earliest
                            possible moment.</p>

                            Institute has accepted the modifications of the crop contract (as
                            clarified) and the President will probably this evening issue a press
                            release describing the amendments. A decree will be necessary to give
                            formal effect thereto but in the meantime the Institute will of course
                            continue the necessary steps to limit invert production, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Casanova will probably announce tonight that the 1942 crop will be
                            3,950,000 Spanish long tons instead of the 3,000,000 previously
                            estimated. Mañas tells me that growers’ estimates now compiled total
                            4,115,000 tons.</p>

                        <p>245. My telegram No. 244, April 25, 9 p.m.<note n="87" xml:id="d344fn87"
                                >Not printed.</note> It is obviously going to be difficult to induce
                            the Cuban Government to agree to extensive use of Habana for sugar
                            shipments on any basis except “war necessity” (not “convenience”).</p>
                        <p>It was not until the immediate problem had been placed before the
                            Minister of State,<note n="89" xml:id="d344fn89">José Manuel
                                Cortina.</note> and Saladrigas<note n="90" xml:id="d344fn90">Carlos
                                Saladrigas, Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</note> in the
                            strongest possible way that authorization for the two ships to be loaded
                            here was granted. During a meeting this afternoon with the latter, Mañas
                            and the <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0336"/>Secretary of
                                Labor,<note n="93" xml:id="d344fn93">Oscar Gans.</note> likewise
                            present, the reluctance of the Government was based on allegedly
                            inevitable labor difficulties. The Prime Minister stated that while the
                            large crop is benefiting <hi rend="italic">hacendados, colonos</hi> and
                            sugar laborers, relatively light exports to date have meant that port
                            workers have not yet shared in those benefits. Furthermore the
                            Government is promoting a full scale labor rally in the capital on May
                            1, and according to Saladrigas it is so fearful that if word of any plan
                            to bring sugar regularly and in large amounts to Habana becomes current,
                            agitation and disturbances will occur, that he has told the Institute to
                            load the two arriving vessels with sugar already here or in the vicinity
                            (even though earmarked and in hold for other purposes) rather than
                            bringing it by rail from more distant ports. (While I do not fully share
                            the Government’s apprehensions, I get the same story from López Castro
                            also, and as the Department is aware he is very close to the President.
                            Moreover Batista’s views towards labor are well known.)</p>
                        <p>I told the Prime Minister that while I sincerely appreciated the
                            Government’s prompt consideration of the problem placed before it by the
                            Institute (my telegram no. 234, April 24, 10 a.m.<note n="94"
                                xml:id="d344fn94">Not printed.</note>) and especially the
                            instructions given the Institute to get the two ships loaded here
                            without delay, I did not regard the problem as settled thereby. I said
                            that the Cuban Government should now squarely face the possibility that
                            unless a much greater use of Habana can be agreed to and supported by
                            the Cuban Government a substantial amount of sugar may have to be left
                            in Cuba, with all that implies. I went on to say that a third ship
                            (Department’s telegram No. 201<note n="94" xml:id="d344fn92">Not
                                printed.</note>) will be coming shortly after May 1, and that
                            according to the information given me by the Naval Attaché<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d344fn95">Maj. Hayne D. Boyden.</note> that vessel also will
                            probably have to come to Habana.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized that two considerations are involved in Habana loading:
                            safety as dictated by the American Navy, and the quickest and most
                            efficient utilization of the limited tonnage available—both objectives
                            of the highest importance to the successful prosecution of the war and
                            of equal interest to the United States—and all the United Nations. I
                            said that the American Government is by no means unsympathetic to Cuban
                            labor, as demonstrated on many occasions, but that I doubted very much
                            indeed whether my Government no matter how favorably the matter might be
                            presented would understand opposition to much less agitation against
                            measures dictated by the war situation. I concluded by expressing
                            confidence that the Cuban Government <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"
                                facs="0337"/>would place the matter frankly before local labor
                            leaders in that light, and that Cuban labor would respond favorably
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>(Privately I am not so sure.) Such incidents as sending away in ballast
                            without explanation the vessel mentioned in my telegram no. 232, April
                            23, 5 p.m.,<note n="96" xml:id="d344fn96">Not printed.</note> with 8
                            million gallons of molasses now in Habana port terminal, do little to
                            bolster our case. A rumor has already been started that the proposed use
                            of Habana is designed to benefit American terminal owners (Ward Line and
                            United Fruit) at the expense of Cuban interests, elsewhere. Finally the
                            present administration here has shown itself from the start somewhat
                            less than anxious to take a strong stand on a matter involving
                            labor.</p>

                        <p>237. Your despatch no. 3805 of April 10, 1942,<note n="99"
                                xml:id="d346fn99">Not printed.</note> and other communications. The
                            interested agencies of this Government, as you are aware, have been
                            engaged in a careful examination of the supply, demand and distribution
                            aspects of sugar and molasses. The number of variable and unpredictable
                            factors which may affect sugar in 1943 make it extremely difficult to
                            determine, with any degree of precision, the quantity of sugar which may
                            be required by the United States from the next Cuban sugar crop.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in view of the request of the Cuban Government for an
                            indication of our probable requirements, and in recognition of the
                            importance of the question to Cuba, an effort has been made to form an
                            estimate which would be of assistance to the Cuban Government. After a
                            careful evaluation of the determining factors including: (1) the
                            extremely uncertain shipping situation; (2) the size of the 1942 Cuban
                            crop and possible stocks remaining in Cuba at the end of this year; and
                            (3) estimated requirements for consumption of United States and other
                            United Nations; it has been concluded that, out of the 1943 Cuban crop,
                            not more than 3,600,000 short tons of sugar (raw equivalent) will be
                            needed to meet anticipated requirements of the United States and other
                            United Nations to which supplies of sugar may be made available by the
                            United States. This includes all forms of sugar (i.e., raw and
                            direct-consumption sugars and molasses for human consumption and other
                            uses) and does not of course include Cuban requirements for sugar and
                            alcohol.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to communicate the foregoing officially to the Cuban
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>At the same time, you should say informally that, although it is of
                            course even more difficult to appraise the possible requirements for
                            sugar from the 1944 crop, at the present time it does not appear that
                            the basic conditions affecting the requirements for sugar from that crop
                            are likely to be substantially different from those affecting 1943 crop
                            requirements.</p>

                            <item>The Cuban Government through the Institute would propose in view
                                of the foregoing that we defer until after January 1 next acceptance
                                at port terminal for shipment of not exceeding 10,000,000 gallons of
                                blackstrap, this amount to be transported by us subsequent to that

                        <p>339. For Briggs from Walmsley: With reference to our telephone
                            conversation this afternoon Sabin points to the last paragraph of your
                            320 of May 18 in which you say that in accordance with your suggested
                            formula “no ‘loan’ would therefore be involved”. He also points to that
                            portion of the DSC’s letter of May 23, of which a copy was sent to you
                            with instruction no. 10 of May 26,<note n="7" xml:id="d350fn7">Not
                                printed.</note> reading “as we understand it, the Corporation would
                            defer the purchase and acceptance of not more than 10,000,000 gallons of
                            blackstrap molasses. The quantity <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327"

                            January 1, 1943, presumably from 1943 production”.</p>
                        <p>The DSC does not feel at liberty to interpret the Board of Economic
                            Warfare’s “directive” in the sense in which you have understood the
                            transaction; so in view of your representations I shall approach the BEW
                            again tomorrow. [Walmsley.]</p>

                        <p>436. For Duggan.<note n="8" xml:id="d351fn8">Laurence Duggan, Adviser on
                                Political Relations.</note> I bespeak your urgent assistance in a
                            matter in which further delay will bring into question our good
                            faith:</p>
                        <p>A month ago following protracted consideration, Defense Supplies
                            Corporation agreed to the delivery by the Institute after next January
                            of not exceeding 10 million gallons of blackstrap. This arrangement
                            costs us nothing for the reason that it is conceded that although we
                            have bought the blackstrap along with the sugar crop, we will be unable
                            to move the entire amount purchased before the end of this year. On the
                            other hand, it represents a valuable concession to Cuba in that it would
                            permit the new price-fixing organization (which is having a difficult
                            time getting started) to use the blackstrap now for conversion to
                            cooking alcohol, the principal fuel of the lower classes at a reasonable
                            price, the amount of blackstrap taken to be returned early in 1943 from
                            next year’s production at a time when it is hoped we can transport it. I
                            repeat that this arrangement will cost us nothing but would be of
                            important present assistance to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>On May 25, the Cuban Government and Institute were informed pursuant to
                            authorization from Defense Supplies Corporation that we agreed to the
                            arrangement whereupon the local price-fixing agency made commitments
                            which it cannot now fulfill because the Corporation declines to release
                            the molasses, alleging that the matter requires further considerations,
                            et cetera. The price-fixing agency now finds itself in a very difficult
                            and increasingly embarrassing position and notwithstanding considerable
                            patience on its part, the point has now been reached where further delay
                            will only result in misunderstanding and ill will.</p>

                            the request of the Cuban Price Control Commission will be found
                            satisfactory by both the Commission and the Sugar Institute and that the

                            Government’s endorsement. The Ambassador will understand that the
                            Corporation in outlining the terms of the arrangement has made the
                            maximum concessions it considers feasible, and there can be no question
                            of further negotiation or discussion of the terms.</p>

                            return from Cuba after Ellis<note n="13" xml:id="d354fn13">Ellis O.

                            Government based on our telegram 237 of May 7, we have been endeavoring
                            to obtain more definite estimates for next year from the appropriate
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>I want to give you the trend of thought in some quarters here, and to ask
                            for your comments.</p>
                        <p>You have reported that on August 5 about 2,120,000 long tons of sugar
                            remained to be shipped. The maximum shipping schedule of sugar for
                            June–December, 1942, as the Embassy was informed, is 1,075,000 short
                            tons or say 950,000 long (680,000 long tons for August–December), and
                            this may be pared down by as much as 14 percent. Therefore, a carryover
                            may be expected of 1,440,000 long tons or more in Cuba on December
                            31.</p>
                        <p>As for the molasses, the probable reduction of the shipping schedule for
                            the rest of the year to 7½ million gallons per month (all from Cuba)
                            will leave a balance there at the end of the year, according to your
                            figures, of close to 175,000,000 gallons.</p>
                        <p>The statistical estimates which have been made of sugar needs from Cuba
                            next year for the United States and for lend lease shipment, in which
                            these carryovers have of course been considered, indicate that Cuba
                            should not make more than 2,260,000 short tons, for all purposes,
                            including domestic consumption.</p>
                        <p>Obviously the shipping situation dominates these calculations.</p>
                        <p>It is my impression that no matter how vigorously Cuba should press its
                            diversification program, the time before the new grinding season is
                            insufficient to develop sufficient alternate work programs for the mass
                            of Cuban sugar workers.</p>
                        <p>In order to form an opinion what amount of sugar should be made next year
                            above statistical requirements for both current consumption and
                            reserves, your comment is urgently required with regard to the amount of
                            alternate work which will be available under the diversification
                            program. I confess that this resembles a quick-sand foundation on which
                            we ask you to build, but I should like nevertheless to have your
                            thoughts as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, Cuban income from sugar this year will be well over
                            $200,000,000. This large income, in the face of a decided shortage of
                            imported supplies and a marked increase in their cost, may <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0344"/>set the stage for inflation; unless
                            some means of diverting some of this income into other than consumption
                            purchase channels is found. This aspect should receive careful
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the past
                            few days have witnessed the inauguration of a local campaign for the
                            apparent purpose of establishing a conviction in the mind of the Cuban
                            people that Cuba has a vested right to a 1943 sugar crop of
                            approximately the same size (4,000,000 long tons) as the 1942 <hi
                                rend="italic">zafra</hi>. This campaign has taken the form of
                            numerous editorials arguing that the wartime economy of the country
                            demands a large crop, with the implication that the United States
                            Government has some moral obligation to make such a crop possible, in
                            order to maintain Cuban economy.</p>
                        <p>The hand of the Government in this campaign emerged yesterday when the
                            Prime Minister, Dr. Ramón Zaydín, made an address at a luncheon at the
                            Lions’ Club. The pertinent clipping from this morning’s <hi

                                xml:id="d355fn14">Not reprinted.</note> and it will be observed that
                            Dr. Zaydín made the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The basic triangle, of urgent interest to the Government,
                                    consists of maritime traffic, the sugar crop, and fuel. It is
                                    stated that the amount of the <hi rend="italic">zafra</hi> will
                                    be reduced, and in the name of the Government I declare that
                                    this cannot and will not be. A reduction of the sugar crop would
                                    bring about a civil war. With the misery existing in the fields,
                                    with the national economy battered, workers and the entire
                                    people would establish a protest based on reason …”<note n="15"

                                Marina</hi> of August 30, 1942, containing an article written by Dr.
                            Ramiro Guerra (now in Habana) in which he speaks optimistically of next
                            year’s prospects, and an editorial from the same paper, (September 1)
                            praising Dr. Guerra’s views. A few days earlier an editorial appeared in
                                <hi rend="italic">El Avance</hi>, the general purport of which was
                            that the United States is in a position to purchase any amount of Cuban
                            sugar that it decides to <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0345"/>buy,
                            the implication being that should we purchase less than in 1942, this
                            would indicate a lack of friendly cooperation.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the purpose of this campaign is to endeavor to jockey
                            our Government into a position in which, should our 1943 purchases fall
                            substantially below those of 1942, Cuba can appear in the role of
                            “injured party”, entitled to “compensations.” Obviously the Cuban
                            Government is behaving somewhat recklessly in this matter since it
                            should be apparent to the industry, and no less to the Government, that
                            our 1943 purchases will be based on our consumption requirements, our
                            transportation availabilities, and the size of the carryover. Moreover,
                            I have already taken occasion to warn President Batista against
                            over-optimism, and I shall seek an early opportunity to make statements
                            to the same effect to the Prime Minister and the Minister of State.<note

                        <p>With the foregoing situation in mind, I consider it highly important that
                            we convey to the Cuban Government at the earliest possible moment a
                            revised estimate of our 1943 requirements, together with an indication

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 891 of September 2, 1942 concerning a number of over optimistic
                            statements issued recently in Habana relative to 1943 sugar prospects,
                            and to report that at a luncheon given by the Federación Nacional de la
                            Industria Minera yesterday I made the following statement: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We have been able to assist materially by purchasing the major
                                    portion of the 1942 crop, which totalled almost 4,000,000 long
                                    tons. Unfortunately, as I have said so many times, it is not so
                                    much the submarines as the necessity of using vessels elsewhere
                                    that creates the difficulties in maritime transportation. The
                                    fact is that during the first eight months of 1942 we have
                                    transported only approximately 30% of the raw sugar and only
                                    slightly more than 40% of the molasses purchased under the Crop
                                    Sale Contract. This fact is of paramount importance in
                                    considering the amount of sugar which my Government may be in a
                                    position to buy next year. The various statements which I have
                                    read recently in the press lead me to wonder whether their
                                    authors may be indulging in wishful thinking, instead of basing
                                    their expectations on realities, however uncomfortable the
                                    latter may be. <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0346"
                                    />Certainly you may rest assured that your Government and my
                                    Government are doing and will continue to do everything humanly
                                    possible in this matter, but simultaneously you must bear in
                                    mind all of the numerous and difficult obstacles which we will
                                    have to overcome, such as the enormous and pressing call upon
                                    our shipping facilities to transport the soldiers and equipment
                                    of the United States and the other United Nations to the
                                    far-flung fighting fronts all over the globe. It is my personal
                                    belief that the transportation problem will not be solved in
                                    this part of the world for many many months to come and that it
                                    will deteriorate before it gets better. It is for these reasons
                                    that we have been unable so far to move to the United States and
                                    to our sugar-hungry allies the stocks which have accumulated in
                                    Cuba and for which we have already paid. It would seem prudent
                                    to take all these facts which I have mentioned today into
                                    consideration when making estimates for 1943.”</p>

                            telegram No. 237 of May 7, 1942 authorizing you to inform the Cuban
                            Government that estimated needs for Cuban sugar in 1943 by the United
                            States and the United Nations would not exceed 3,600,000 short tons,
                            including invert molasses and excluding local consumption, to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 504 of August 18, 1942<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d357fn20">Not printed.</note> relating to alternate work
                            programs in Cuba, and to other exchanges concerning next year’s sugar
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>It is believed on the basis of considerations set forth below that the
                            maximum amount of sugar which Cuba would be warranted in producing for
                            export purposes next year would be 2,600,000 short tons. You are,
                            therefore, requested to deliver a memorandum to the Cuban Government
                            along the lines indicated in the enclosure.<note n="20"

                        <p>For your own information only, you are advised that the Food Requirements
                            Committee has determined that “our requirements for sugar from the
                            offshore areas should be established at the quantities permitted by the
                            use of such shipping facilities as are available after providing for our
                            shipping needs for more critical commodities”. On this basis, our
                            shipping authorities estimate at the present time that from 2,000,000 to
                            2,240,000 short tons of sugar may be lifted in Cuba next year for the
                            United States, including re-exports to other United Nations. It may be
                            observed that the lower figure of 2,000,000 exceeds by about 800,000
                            short tons the quantity which could be moved on the basis of the
                            shipping schedule for the remainder of this year and envisages,
                            therefore, additional shipping facilities for sugar in 1943. Direct
                            exports to countries other than the United States might range from none
                            at all to possibly 448,000 short tons, the quantity which it is
                            estimated by the British Food Mission may be taken by the United
                            Kingdom, Canada, and other countries.</p>
                        <p>In presenting the attached memorandum to the Cuban Government, you are
                            authorized to say orally that this Government appreciates the problems
                            which may arise from the reduction in the crop. You may add that this
                            Government stands ready to examine, with the appropriate Cuban
                            authorities, measures of cooperation to maintain the amount of economic
                            activity which may be considered necessary to take up this slack.</p>

                                provocative and unsatisfactory.</note> of a three-hour meeting
                            yesterday evening with Prime Minister Zaydín, Minister of State
                            Martínez, Sr. Amadeo López Castro and Ambassador Concheso during which I
                            explained in some detail why I did not believe it would be desirable for
                            the Cuban Government to maintain its note of October 15 (please see
                            despatch No. 1297 of October 17<note n="23" xml:id="d359fn23">Not

                            crop. Although President Batista had already volunteered to have the
                            note withdrawn and had so informed the ministers prior to the meeting, I
                            am glad to say that all of the Cubans present expressed themselves at
                            the end of the meeting as satisfied that in all the circumstances the
                            maintenance of this note could only impair the prospects for successful
                            sugar negotiations in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Unless he changes his mind, (which I regard as improbable) Prime Minister
                            Zaydín will head the Cuban delegation, which will also include Sr.
                            Amadeo López Castro. I expect that Dr. Mañas will be named and I shall
                            take the occasion to express the hope that he is a member of the group
                            since I have found him unfailingly helpful and practical in his approach
                            to the problem.</p>

                            it is necessary to negotiate a purchase. Instruction No. 698, September
                            25, 1942 authorized you to inform the Cuban Government that the maximum
                            amount of sugar Cuba would be warranted in producing next year for
                            export purposes would be 2,600,000 short tons. It did not say that “our
                            probable maximum sugar purchase in 1943” would be 2,600,000 short tons
                            (first paragraph of your despatch 1183), nor was mention made in the
                            Department’s telegram No. 237 of May 7, 1942 of a 1943 “purchase”. While
                            the purchase of next year’s crop has been discussed with other
                            interested agencies of the Government as a possible procedure, no
                            decision has been made, as you will observe from the second paragraph of
                            our instruction 698 and the fourth paragraph of the memorandum enclosed
                            with the instruction, which you were authorized to deliver to the Cuban

                        <p>Officials in Washington are giving special attention to the economic
                            problems which the Cuban Government alleges would arise from a crop
                            restricted to estimated requirements alone. One of the possible
                            solutions which has been examined is a financing arrangement wherein the
                            risk for the production of additional sugar would be borne by the
                            producers. In this connection, reference is made to the last paragraph
                            of the Department’s instruction 698 in which you were authorized to
                            state orally to the Cuban Government that this Government is ready to

                            that the United States should have no misgivings about storage. The

                            <item>Since the determination of the size of the 1943 crop, the
                                discussions have revolved about the problem of price. The criteria
                                of the Cuban and the United States Commissions have been similar;
                                namely, that the grinding of a crop is to furnish labor income, not
                                employer profit. The United States Commission on this basis made the
                                offer of 2.65¢ f.o.b. in the ship’s hold, certain charges previously
                                borne by this Government to be borne by the industry. This price,
                                together with <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0354"/>1.00¢ per
                                pound for 500,000 tons of relief sugar, would provide Cuba an income
                                from sugar production of $142,500,000.</item>

                            <item>The Cuban Commission, in its memorandum of December 11,<note

                                set forth arguments designed to demonstrate the inadequacy of this
                                price on the conditions stipulated. The United States Commission has
                                been glad to re-examine the proposed terms in the light of the Cuban
                                contentions and to set forth the following terms, which, after
                                several days of exhaustive study, represent the final conclusions of
                                the United States Government.</item>

                                set forth hereafter. It is estimated that they will provide
                                additional benefit to the Cuban sugar industry to the extent of at
                                least $12,050,000.</item>

                            tons), but 2,600,000 tons will be purchased by the United States at
                            2.65¢ subject to the provisions stated below:</p>
                        <p>(2) The price of 2.65¢ is for sugar placed within reach of ship’s tackle,

                            respectively, as agreed to, on June 1, 1943 instead of on October 1,
                            1943. This will represent a net saving in interest on pignorated sugar,
                            according to the Cuban memorandum of December 11, 1942, of about
                            $1,500,000.</p>
                        <p>(6) The Defense Supplies Corporation will purchase up to 75,000,000
                            gallons of the exportable surplus of the 1943 production of blackstrap
                            molasses at ¼¢ per English pound of blackstrap molasses having a minimum
                            sugar content of 52%, delivered f.o.b. ocean-going vessel at ports of
                            shipment acceptable to an appropriate agency of the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>This purchase will increase the income from the crop by about
                            $2,250,000.</p>
                        <p>(7) On March 1, 1943, the Commodity Credit Corporation will pay over to
                            the Cuban Sugar Stabilization Institute $1,000,000 as a fund to defray
                            excess cost of moving sugar from <hi rend="italic">batey</hi> to ports
                            other than natural shipping ports, which movement will be undertaken by
                            the producer on direction of Commodity.</p>
                        <p>The Institute will draw on buyers for a portion of the value of each
                            shipment (for example, 10 points). The proceeds will be placed in the
                            same fund with the $1,000,000 and utilized for the same purpose.</p>
                        <p>If the extra transportation costs in connection with movements to other
                            natural ports should exceed the fund, the producers will be expected to
                            pay the excess. If these costs are less than the fund, the surplus funds
                            may be prorated among the mills when all of the 1943 crop has been
                            exported from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The net increase of income to Cuba under this proposal is therefore at
                            least $1,000,000.</p>
                        <p>(8) The Cuban producers will be expected to bear the cost of warehousing
                            and insurance of unshipped sugars.</p>
                        <p>(9) The previously stipulated conditions for the sugar transaction,
                            insofar as they are not affected by the foregoing modifications and
                            conditions, remain as set forth in the memorandum delivered to the Cuban
                            Commission on December 8, 1942, a copy of which is attached.<note

                            affected by an increase in price which may result from the operation of
                            the arrangement described under paragraph (4) above, since the United
                            States Government has given its contribution of 1.50¢ per pound on the
                            400,000 ton stockpile for the payment of wages at the same levels
                            previously prevailing.</p>

                                    occurred out of which emerged two modifications, which were

                                    Commission itself left Washington with the impression that our
                                    proposition was final after talking with the Under Secretary.
                                    What we now await, therefore, is the decision of the Cuban
                                    Government as to the acceptability of our final proposition. We
                                    are prepared to start the negotiation of the contract
                                    immediately upon advice by the Cuban Government that the
                                    proposal is accepted.</item>

                                <item>While the Department and the other cooperating agencies
                                    believe we have gone as far as we can to meet the undefined
                                    Cuban <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0357"/>desires, and are
                                    not disposed to enter into negotiations for modification of the
                                    proposal as finally presented, they do not, of course, exclude
                                    the possibility of rectifying any points of minor detail which
                                    may come up in the course of the discussion of the terms of the
                                    contract.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In résumé, what we would like to have now from the Cuban Government is a
                            clear decision whether the proposal as presented is accepted, so that
                            the drafting of the contract can be started at once.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information and not to be communicated to
                            the Prime Minister, the Department is prepared to recommend to the other
                            agencies the following modifications in our proposal: <list>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</label>
                                <item>An agreement to carry warehousing costs and insurance costs of
                                    unshipped sugar after June 30, 1944. The other agencies will
                                    undoubtedly insist upon and the Department may feel obliged to
                                    agree to a date of December 31, 1944, since that date was in
                                    fact used in an earlier draft of the contract.</item>
                                <label>
                                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</label>
                                <item>A modification of point (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) of the
                                    General Terms in our memorandum of December 8, 1942 in the sense
                                    that the two Governments will consult together along the lines
                                    suggested by you in your telephone conversation.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other two suggestions of the Prime Minister are not of a character
                            which we would like to take up with the other agencies. With regard to
                            inland transportation it would not be proper for this Government to be a
                            party to an arrangement of possible prejudice to the interests of a
                            legitimate United States interest in Cuba, namely, the Consolidated
                            Railroads. The Cuban Government has the jurisdiction and faculties to
                            adjust railroad freight rates at all times and is at complete liberty to
                            act in this regard.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the proposal on the stockpile, the BEW has clearly and
                            definitely indicated its unwillingness to increase the contribution to
                            the stockpile. The Department perceives no reason why the proceeds from
                            the purchase of molasses could not be dedicated to the cost of the
                            stockpile, particularly since the purchase of this molasses represents
                            to Cuba totally unexpected income.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: During the summer of
                            1941 the Seatrain Lines, carrying freight cars in an ocean service
                            between Gulf <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0358"/>ports, Habana, and
                            New York, placed two of its five vessels at the service of the Maritime
                            Commission. The Seatrain service has for many years been an integral
                            part of the transportation system between the United States and
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The importance of this service to Cuba is demonstrated by the fact that
                            in December 1941 one-fifth of all imports by Cuba from this country and
                            about one-third of the exports from Cuba to the United States were
                            carried by Seatrains. Among the export cargoes from Cuba which move in
                            this manner are strategically essential sugar, molasses, ores, minerals
                            and scrap metals. The Seatrains are loading their capacity of about 90
                            to 105 American freight cars per trip. This means a very fast turn
                            around and a considerable economy of relatively scarce labor.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the withdrawal of the remaining Seatrains
                            is about to be recommended to you for approval. It may be that the
                            exigencies of the national defense will require the use of these vessels
                            for the specific purposes for which withdrawal will make them available.
                            However, the service is not only vital to Cuban economy but is highly
                            important to the United States. Defense ores and large quantities of
                            sugar and molasses contracted for by the Federal Loan Agency and which
                            cannot otherwise be transported are involved, as well as the distinct
                            disturbance to the whole economy of Cuba.</p>

                            traffic, as well as the Commercial traffic which this route maintained,
                            chiefly for the transportation of tobacco and vegetables—very heavy at
                            this time of year—is suffering greatly.</p>

                        <p>Also, the withdrawal of the steamship <hi rend="italic">Shawnee</hi>
                            limits the possibility of exporting Cuban vegetables to the port of New

                            Excellency’s Government to the end that the United States Maritime
                            Commission may seek to obtain some vessel which can reestablish traffic
                            on the Habana–Key West–Tampa run and that the steamship <hi

                            service as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Although I recognize the urgency of war needs, and that the withdrawal of
                            the two vessels mentioned is due to that, I shall appreciate it if Your
                            Excellency, should you consider it proper, would be good enough to

                            remedy the situation created, in the manner it considers most

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Careful consideration
                            has been given to your letter of January 22, 1942, with regard to the
                            vessels operated by Seatrain Lines between Gulf ports, Havana and New
                            York, there being five (5) special design of ships under operation by
                            this company, two (2) of which were taken by the Maritime Commission and
                            turned over to the Navy Department for the necessary conversion and use
                            for essential national defense purposes.</p>
                        <p>You, of course, are aware that this subject is a matter falling under the
                            statutory cognizance of the Maritime Commission in accordance with
                            Section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that voluminous correspondence has already taken place
                            between the Owner of the Line and the Maritime Commission so that all of
                            the facts are available and these in turn have been made available to
                            both the Navy Department and the War Department. During the past six
                            months the question has been repeatedly considered by the Maritime
                            Commission and the Navy Department of taking over either one, two or
                            three of the remaining vessels. After <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                                facs="0360"/>repeated investigations and discussion of the subject,
                            the Navy Department finally relinquished its claims to these three (3)
                            vessels, not because they could not utilize them satisfactorily but
                            because of the commercial conditions existing which made it appear more
                            desirable to retain them in commercial use rather than divert them to
                            special Naval use.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, December 7th occurred and the necessity of additional
                            ships far beyond those available either under American flag or under
                            American control became more and more evident. Specifically, the War
                            Department has definite military uses for these three (3) vessels but in
                            order not to seriously hamper commercial activities whenever and
                            wherever it can be avoided, the present general status of the matter is
                            to take these remaining three (3) vessels one at a time and then only if
                            urgent military requirements necessitate such action.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest to note that this design of ship has many advantages
                            for both commercial and military work but unfortunately some of the
                            important advantages are entirely dependent upon shore installations,
                            and the commercial operations of these vessels require primary
                            utilization at those ports only where exist the particular port
                            facilities essential to efficient handling of the cargo containers
                            primarily utilized in their operations. This being true, it is necessary
                            for the Navy to install cargo-handling devices on the ships themselves
                            which the Navy took over and some similar modifications and
                            installations will have to be made if and when any of the remaining
                            three (3) vessels are taken over by the Army. Present investigations
                            indicate that less elaborate conversions and installations will be
                            necessary for Army purposes than have obtained for Navy purposes.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, please be assured that full consideration has been and
                            will be given to this matter and it is my understanding that final
                            action will not be taken with regard to the remaining three (3) vessels
                            until it is evident that the necessities of national defense require
                            such action.</p>

                                Aurelio F. Concheso.</note> informed me that the service of the
                            United Fruit Company between New York, Habana, and Central America <pb
                                n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0361"/>had been totally suspended;
                            also that the sailings of two of the four ships of the Fred Olsen Line
                            from the north Pacific to Cuba via the Panama Canal had been
                            discontinued. Moreover, it was rumored that the last ship in the service
                            between Miami, Habana, and Tampa was to be removed. He said that this
                            situation was going to create havoc in the movement of Cuban products,
                            particularly fresh vegetables.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned Mr. Wilcox in the Maritime Commission who confirmed the
                                foregoing<note n="33" xml:id="d368fn33">A marginal notation at this
                                point reads: “Not withdrawal of ship in Habana–Miami run.”</note>
                            and added that the two remaining ships of the Seatrain Line were going
                            to be put into service between New Orleans and Habana in lieu of New
                            York and Habana. In this way they could make more sailings. He said that
                            to move the sugar crop arrangements had been made for 75 to 80 thousand
                            tons of shipping of which 50% would move to the east coast and 50% via
                            New Orleans. On the southbound trips these ships would be available to
                            carry cargo to Cuba. With regard to the carriage of Cuban vegetables, he
                            admitted that the situation was going to be bad. He explained to me once
                            again the reasons for the withdrawal of this shipping.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador frankly that it had been necessary to remove the
                            ships for military reasons; that Cuba, however, was not suffering any
                            more than the other American countries; and that everything that could
                            be done would be done to insure sufficient ships to move Cuba’s imports
                            and exports.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador took the information as well as might be expected but
                            naturally left very unhappy over the prospective situation.</p>

                                Castro<note n="36" xml:id="d369fn36">Cuban Secretary of the

                            his forthcoming visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>While the situation from the point of view of Cuba is far from
                            satisfactory, I doubt whether any substantial losses have yet occurred
                            through failure to move Cuban products (such losses will however become
                            inevitable this month unless relief is afforded). The passenger
                            situation is extremely difficult, present facilities being confined to
                            Pan American Airways. Inadequacy of southbound freight service has thus
                            far caused inconvenience rather than loss. I do not believe, however,
                            that the Minister exaggerated the extent of public feeling or the
                            capital which our enemies here are attempting to make of the situation.
                            The Habana newspapers are clamouring daily for more shipping.</p>
                        <p>If it is possible to do so, I think it would be helpful if a statement
                            could be made to Concheso or López Castro in sympathetic terms outlining
                            what we may be in a position to do in the immediate future and in
                            particular making some assurance with regard to moving the March

                        <p>115. My telegram No. 100, March 3, 10 p.m. The Embassy has carefully
                            investigated the Habana maritime shipping situation alleged by the
                            Ministry of State and has ascertained that while facilities for winter
                            vegetables were inadequate during the week ended February 28 when from
                            10,000 to 15,000 crates were short shipped of which a part had to be
                            dumped, facilities last week, when the Ward Line had two and the car
                            ferry four northbound sailings, were not only adequate but the Ward Line
                            steamer which sailed on March 5 had refrigerator space for 14,000 more
                            crates of tomatoes than were actually shipped. (The Embassy has been
                            informed that failure to use all the space available last week was due
                            to unfavorable New York tomato market.)</p>
                        <p>The Ward Line expects to have one and the car ferry six weekly northbound
                            sailings during the remainder of March so that the balance of Cuba’s
                            winter vegetable crop, whose peak season terminates this month, should
                            apparently be moved without further serious difficulties.<note n="37"

                                Division of the American Republics.</note> Unless a supply of
                            newsprint reaches Habana early next week most of the newspapers in Cuba
                            will be forced to cease publication. With the exception of <hi
                                rend="italic">Marina</hi>, all Habana papers have drastically
                            reduced the number of pages. <hi rend="italic">Mundo</hi> now publishes
                            only one edition greatly reduced in size and has stopped its circulation
                            in the eastern half of Cuba. The Reciprocal Trading Company here which
                            sells newsprint to all of the large Habana newspapers and to the
                            principal papers in the interior has supplied the following <pb n="350"
                                xml:id="pg_350" facs="0364"/>information which the Embassy considers
                            accurate and which checks with estimates obtained from other sources: <list>

                                <item>Fourteen Habana newspapers consume a total of 77 rolls of
                                    newsprint per day. As of yesterday their combined stocks
                                    consisted of about 362 rolls. Some newspapers have no newsprint
                                    whatever and are maintaining restricted publication by the
                                    purchase of a few rolls on a daily basis from other newspapers
                                    still possessing small stocks.</item>

                        <p>Publishers and editors are naturally greatly concerned and many believe
                            that our Government is not making a serious effort to help them. Ships
                            continue to arrive in Habana from New York with general cargo but no
                            newsprint and publishers cannot understand why, if no space for
                            newsprint is available on vessels from New York, it cannot be arranged
                            to transport supplies of newsprint by railroad freight to a Florida port
                            for transshipment by car, ferry, or otherwise; it is, of course, highly
                            important in terms of our good offices in Cuba that local newspapers not
                            be forced to suspend publication due to our inability to arrange
                            shipment of minimum necessities of newsprint from the United States.
                            Publishers have exercised considerable patience thus far but always on
                            the assumption their minimum needs will be met.</p>

                                printed.</note> prepared by the Commercial Attaché, regarding
                            certain difficulties which had arisen in connection with the shipment to
                            the United States of this year’s Cuban pineapple crop.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that complaints had been made against the Florida East
                            Coast Car Ferry Company on the ground that certain shippers were not
                            being supplied with adequate shipping space, and that this matter
                            appears to have been satisfactorily settled by the allocation of
                            additional cars to the shippers in question.</p>
                        <p>It is encouraging to note that in spite of the scarcity of shipping
                            facilities, Car Ferry officials estimate that barring unforeseen
                            contingencies, <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0365"/>their line,
                            together with the Seatrain Lines, Incorporated, will be able to move
                            roughly 830,000 crates of pineapples this season, which would be only
                            slightly less than the 843,392 crates which they state were shipped via
                            all lines during the 1941 season.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Morse stated that he had come to the Department to give a complete
                            picture of a situation that is about to arise with regard to shipping to
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>According to Mr. Morse, the Navy has requested and will obtain in the
                            very near future the two car ferries plying between Port Everglades and
                            Habana, and carrying 26 cars on a six-day per week schedule. These
                            vessels appear to be ideally suited for work as mine layers.</p>
                        <p>The remaining service by which railroad cars are carried between the two
                            countries, consists of two vessels of the Seatrain Lines, Inc., at
                            present running on a one-trip per week schedule between New Orleans and
                            Habana. The President of these lines has proposed that the New York
                            terminal facilities be transferred to Boca Grande, Florida, and that one
                            of the remaining vessels be transferred to a route between that city and
                            Habana. Mr. Morse stated that this possibility had been carefully
                            investigated by the Seatrain Lines, and that it appears entirely
                            practicable. It was estimated, for example, that some 710,000 tons of
                            sugar alone could be moved to the United States annually, by means of
                            one Seatrain of this route.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morse spoke of the request made by the War Department for the two
                            remaining vessels.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0366"/>
                        <p>The unfortunate effect on Cuba was touched upon and it was determined
                            that the Department would present its views to the War Shipping
                            Administration for use in discussing the matter further with the War
                            Department. The approach would be to determine, if possible, the minimum
                            import tonnage to Cuba from the United States, covering her essential
                            needs, below which minimum it would be difficult to go without serious
                            repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Shipping facilities to move this minimum tonnage would probably require
                            either the retention of a car ferry or Seatrain service, or the
                            substitution of other adequate service.</p>
                        <p>A telephone request was made of the Embassy at Habana for an estimate of
                            minimum tonnage requirements on an annual basis.</p>

                        <p>312. Pineapple shipping situation described in Embassy’s airmail despatch
                            no. 3982 of May 9<note n="43" xml:id="d374fn43">Not printed.</note> has
                            become increasingly serious as car ferries are still immobilized and as
                            agent has been notified that Navy proposes to take over the two vessels
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>As car ferries are only remaining means of shipping perishables their
                            loss would make it impossible to ship balance of Cuban pineapple crop,
                            the approaching avocado and the grapefruit crops, the next winter
                            vegetable crop not to mention chilled beef and other perishables. This
                            would spell ruin to many hundred of small Cuban growers who are
                            dependent upon the American market, and the adverse effect on Cuba’s
                            economic structure and morale would be difficult to overestimate.</p>
                        <p>In addition to perishables car ferry has been handling large and
                            increasing percentage of north and south bound general cargo as well as
                            mail and express shipments.</p>

                            service not only be maintained but the transfer of its operations to
                            Boca Grande, Florida, be urgently undertaken. Also if possible return by

                            Isle of Pines grapefruit growers who have been informed that the United
                            States Government has refused to authorize further importations of fresh
                            fruit from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>These growers, many of whom are Americans, had, the Governor stated, just
                            succeeded after considerable difficulty and on their own initiative in
                            making arrangements for the shipment of the crop by schooner to Florida
                            and inability to effect shipment will spell ruin to many of them who are
                            dependent upon the crop for their livelihood.</p>

                        <p>716. Your A–84, August 19, 1 p.m. An exemption to General Imports Order
                            M–63 will not be granted for the importation of grapefruit on one of the
                            Seatrain vessels. The War Production Board does not want grapefruit to
                            move by seatrain since it believes that such movement would prevent the
                            shipment of more important commodities. <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355"
                                facs="0369"/>The Board would give more sympathetic consideration to
                            applications for exemptions permitting the importation of grapefruit if
                            shipment were to be made on small steamers.</p>
                        <p>Since it is now evident that if grapefruit were removed from the lists of
                            commodities covered by General Imports Order M–63 their movement would
                            probably not be confined to small steamers, it appears likely that they
                            will continue to be subject to the Order.</p>

                        <p>A–113. The normal imports of newsprint for Cuba have been approximately
                            1300 tons per month for all purposes, 300 tons of which have been used
                            as wrapping paper. Due to the critical shipping situation, it is
                            proposed that 700 tons be shipped monthly, which represents a 30 per
                            cent reduction from normal imports for newspapers and magazines. The
                            Department requests the Embassy to urge a curtailment in the number of
                            editions and size of newspapers by 30 per cent. The Embassy’s comments

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 707 of August 13, 1942,<note n="47" xml:id="d384fn47">Not
                                printed.</note> relative to certain suggestions made to the Cuban
                            Government, at the instance of the Department, for more economic
                            utilization and handling of vessels engaged in Cuban-American commerce,
                            and to report that I took up this problem during a conversation with
                            President Batista on September 11.</p>
                        <p>While I believe that the President is well disposed in principle, there
                            is considerable reluctance to take action in matters which may involve
                            opposition of Labor elements, such as increasing the per sling load of
                            sugar bags or abandoning the newly established system of rotation for
                            port workers in Habana. I again pointed out that not only was more
                            efficient and expeditious handling of vessels necessary for our mutual
                            war effort, but I said that a continuance of existing conditions would
                            discourage authorities elsewhere from sending ships to Cuba when a quick
                            turn around was required, thus labor was prejudicing itself.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue to press for favorable action on these proposals, but I
                            anticipate that the Government may be somewhat reluctant to adopt our
                            suggestions because of its unwillingness thus far squarely to meet the
                            Labor issue.</p>

                            from the Port of Habana to the United States, including shipments in
                            transit to Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Venezuela, totalled
                            74,657 long tons during the period October 14 to October 30, 1942, as
                            against 25,272 long tons and 38,988 long tons, respectively, during the

                        <p>While the heavier shipments are, of course, partly due to an increase in
                            available tonnage and to improved escort service, they are to a large
                            extent the result of the well-directed and successful efforts of Mr. M.

                        <p>933. Personal for the Under Secretary of State. A decision appears to be
                            imminent whether the Seatrain <hi rend="italic">New Orleans</hi> will
                            remain in service between Port Everglades and Habana or whether it will
                            be withdrawn by the Army. The Seatrain <hi rend="italic">New
                                Orleans</hi> has recently made two voyages within 16 days handling
                            virtually no southbound cargo; they have removed 978 American railway
                            cars from Habana loaded with sugar and other merchandise. American cars
                            in Cuba have thereby been reduced to minimum needed for continued
                            service. If permitted to continue in the Port Everglades–Habana trade
                            the Seatrain could if especially escorted by the Navy handle from 15,000
                            to 20,000 tons of cargo loaded in cars per month in each direction.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0372"/>
                        <p>According to our information more barge and similar equipment is being
                            assigned to the Florida Habana service which will result in the
                            withdrawal of vessels suitable for handling northbound perishable
                            commodities especially tomatoes, pineapples and other fruits and winter
                            vegetables the exportation of which is essential to Cuba’s economy. In
                            addition the services of the Seatrain are particularly important in
                            connection with southbound shipments of certain essential products which
                            must be shipped in bulk in tank cars.</p>
                        <p>The Seatrain is a specially built vessel which is of doubtful utility for
                            purposes other than those for which it is designed as was evidenced by
                            the difficulties experienced here in its attempts to convert the
                            Seatrain <hi rend="italic">Texas</hi> to its uses (please see my letter
                            to George Scherer of April 28<note n="48" xml:id="d386fn48">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> and subsequent correspondence regarding the
                            Seatrain <hi rend="italic">Texas</hi>).</p>
                        <p>According to my information the <hi rend="italic">New Orleans</hi> is
                            even less suitable for long voyages than the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Texas</hi> due to overbearing fuel capacity, high fuel consumption
                            and lack of speed.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above mentioned factors I feel justified in enlisting your
                            personal intercession with the War Department and with the War Shipping
                            Administration in favor of retaining the <hi rend="italic">New

                        <p>1101. From the Under Secretary. Your 933, November 4, 8 p.m. I too
                            appreciate the utility of the seatrain to Cuba. Nevertheless, the Army’s
                            experience with the seatrains, particularly in the movement of tanks,
                            has been very good. The War Shipping Administration confirms this. It is
                            true that these good results have been obtained with the faster
                            seatrains. However, the War Department believes that it will have
                            relatively good success with the seatrain <hi rend="italic">New
                                Orleans</hi> and in this the War Shipping Administration
                            concurs.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, the War Department has warned the War Shipping
                            Administration that the withdrawal of the <hi rend="italic">New
                                Orleans</hi> is imminent and has advised that agency to utilize the
                            remaining time of this vessel in returning American railroad cars
                            presently in Cuba to the United States. Once the total of these cars in
                            Cuba has been reduced to a workable minimum and as long as the seatrain
                            is permitted <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0373"/>to stay in the

                            affected to nearly the same extent as has the movement of United States
                            products to other American republics, which have been affected by a
                            reduction in the northbound movement as well as by their distance from
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>In general, this Government has taken the position that the only reason
                            for maintaining shipping to another area is to move the minimum import
                            requirements and the strategic materials of that area. Non-essential
                            imports from all areas have been stopped or reduced to a point where
                            they present no real shipping problem. Where absolutely necessary, steps
                            not involving the use of shipping have been taken to alleviate
                            conditions in the areas most severely affected, but the over-all
                            position of the economy of the country involved is considered
                            carefully.</p>
                        <p>At present the Department is making known its views, which are readily
                            recognized, that the seatrain <hi rend="italic">New Orleans</hi> is an
                            extremely useful vessel from Cuba’s point of view, but I believe our
                            guiding consideration in this case must be the opinion of the War
                            Department as to the utility of this vessel from a military standpoint.

                            Dominican Republic in the Dominican-Haitian Convention. The Legation is
                            aware that the Haitian imports upon which the Dominican Government has
                            granted tariff concessions in the Dominican-Haitian Convention are of
                            such nature there is little likelihood of any importations of importance
                            of these articles from the <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0375"
                            />United States into the Dominican Republic. However, in view of the
                            probability that some importations of these products will be made from
                            the United States, the Legation would appreciate the Department’s
                            instructions as to the attitude which it should assume with reference to
                            the unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to which the United
                            States is entitled from the Dominican Republic as a result of the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of September 25, 1924. It is to be
                            assumed that American exporters and Dominican importers will request
                            that they be granted the advantages of the Dominican-Haitian Convention
                            with respect to the importations into this country of United States
                            products on which the duty has been lowered by the present convention.
                            On the other hand, it is to be expected that the Dominican Government
                            will maintain that since the United States has not exercised its right
                            as a most-favored-nation with Haiti with reference to this convention it
                            should not exercise it with the Dominican Republic.</p>

                            expenditures, and will make the site available to our Navy on a basis of

                        <p>Up to the writing of this despatch, January 15, 5 p.m., the instruction
                            that I have from the Department is that the Navy is interested in
                            establishing an advance Naval air base at Salinas and as we view it here
                            everything has been done to facilitate the proper handling of whoever
                            may come. (See Department’s telegram No. 18, January 10, 8 p.m. and my
                            reply No. 33, January 12, 2 p.m.<note n="6" xml:id="d391fn6">Latter not

                                Defense/1892).</note>). Not only did Ecuador collaborate in sending
                            to Salinas a representative of its Navy Department along with our Naval
                            Attaché, but Captain Anda was given instructions to look carefully over
                            the ground desired by our Naval Officers from Panamá, who visited
                            Salinas on the 7, 8, and 9th of January.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of both navies (Captain Anda and Commander Greenacre)
                            returned to Quito on January 14 and had an interview with the President
                            which was satisfactory. He gave his approval to the plan after examining
                            the map showing the land desired and reading a description thereof. To
                            remove any possibility of misunderstanding I handed the President a
                            confidential memorandum outlining the duties of each Government. See
                            enclosure No. 1.<note n="7" xml:id="d391fn7">Not printed. According to
                                its terms Ecuador was to obtain the land, remove all buildings, and
                                cooperate in maintaining the base by issuing police regulations; the
                                United States was to build the base and compensate Ecuador for its
                                expenses.</note> He approved the procedure in principle.</p>
                        <p>Upon leaving the President we visited the home of the Defense Minister
                            who had just returned from Cayambe, and reviewed the whole matter with
                            him. Colonel Guerrero borrowed the outline map of the property to be
                            used by our Navy, also the description, and while approving in
                            principle, offered to go further into the matter upon returning from
                            Salinas Friday. He also thought the outline of procedure
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>To both the President and the Minister we explained that the selection of
                            lands as provisionally made by our Naval Officers from Panamá had been
                            cut down by a couple of blocks by Captain Anda to avoid the removal of
                            some rather substantial houses: we knew the land desired would not be
                            less than indicated and it well might be more, depending upon military
                            necessities.</p>

                            supporting ground troops temporarily at Salinas and Galápagos, as he
                            understood Ecuador had made either available for such purposes.</p>
                        <p>He sent a representative, Colonel Connell, to Salinas, November 13th who
                            is understood to have conferred with Major Renshaw also the Navy men
                            indicated above, and tentatively to have indicated the approximate
                            location the Army might prefer to utilize. We were not told its exact
                            location, but as it neither interfered with what the Navy desired, or
                            what the Chief of our Air Mission (Major Renshaw) wished for the primary
                            training school, it was thought there would be no conflict. Moreover,
                            the site indicated by the Army had no buildings on it which should
                            simplify its occupation without delay.</p>
                        <p>Captain Anda and Commander Greenacre mentioned the above to the President
                            and the Defense Minister on January 14th. All thought it would be
                            satisfactory. The Ecuadoran Executive and his Minister wondered how many
                            there would be of the Army contingent. None of us knew, but speculated
                            there might be around 700.</p>
                        <p>We have neither map nor description of the lands desired by the Army, but
                            if and when the contingent arrives we will endeavor to have a
                            representative of the Ecuadoran Government on the ground to facilitate
                            all arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Procter has notified the Defense Minister in writing of the
                            Army’s temporary interest at Salinas.</p>
                        <p>Rumor has it that Ecuador will install a full Colonel in charge of this
                            country’s troops at Salinas.</p>
                        <p>This despatch should be read in conjunction with our No. 2492 of January

                            Colonel Romero and General Lyon. The latter took his to General Andrews,
                            Quarry Heights. I attach hereto as enclosures Nos. 1 and 2 one copy in
                            English and one in Spanish.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that the negotiations were conducted at Salinas where the
                            agreement was drafted, but, as Ecuadoran officials felt they lacked
                            authorization to sign, the negotiating parties flew to Quito, and after
                            conferences with the Minister of National Defense (who previously
                            consulted the President) received his approval to the plan and
                            agreement. I think some slight reservations were made to the effect that
                            if found to be susceptible of improvement (or possibly amplification)
                            the agreement might be modified later.</p>
                        <p>The President of Ecuador received General Lyon a couple of hours previous
                            to the signing of the agreement, and when reference was made thereto the
                            President said that he was familiar with it and thought that instead of
                            having it good for a year after the signing of peace, we might employ
                            the same phraseology as had been used in the Cooperative Defense
                            Agreement as to termination. It was explained that a year might be
                            needed to dismantle the base and/or reach understandings and carry them
                            out. The President did not press this point, so the signers did not
                            alter paragraph fifteen.</p>

                            on January 24th., 7:00 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Astudillo suggests for consideration of the commander of the 15th
                            District that in the 4th military zone in Ecuador it might be hazardous
                            to have only an air force at Santa Elena point. He urges, <pb n="366"
                                xml:id="pg_366" facs="0380"/>that consideration be given to Play as
                            and Posorja in order to prevent any force from going behind Santa Elena
                            and isolating the point.</p>
                        <p>The Colonel, by the same token, pointed out that it would be wise to have
                            some forces on Puná, which commands the entrance to the harbor at
                            Guayaquil. He felt that with these two additions the troops at Santa
                            Elena would have ample protection.</p>
                        <p>The Colonel also pointed out that at Punta Piedras there were 4 cannon
                            (Armstrong, 105 mm) and in addition there were scattered along the coast
                            8 batteries (32 cannon) (Krupp 75 mm), but no ammunition. Could we
                            assist Ecuador in this regard?</p>
                        <p>General Lyon said that such things were beyond his authority, but he
                            would mention them to General Andrews.</p>

                            Japanese Chargé d’Affaires. This event was reported to the Department in

                        <p>This evening, after a friendly chat with the President, he observed that
                            he did not know precisely what his Defense Minister had in mind but
                            would let me know soon.</p>
                        <p>He added that under his administration Ecuador has maintained a good
                            record for paying its obligations. He wished to continue and not sign a
                            lease-lend contract containing terms that Ecuador could not meet. He
                            requested that I cable that he wrote Ambassador Alfaro at length asking
                            some adjustment that would fall within Ecuador’s capacity to pay, but in
                            reply had been told how very busy Washington was.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was anxious to collaborate and hoped he would soon
                            hear through Alfaro or me regarding a clarification of terms. Ecuador
                            was very anxious to get the four planes recently discussed and as much
                            additional material as we could supply but under the conditions outlined

                        <p>158. My 153, February 25, 9 p.m. The Minister of National Defense today
                            informed Colonel Montesinos and Major Renshaw that work might proceed
                            without interruption on Galápagos Islands but that he will not sign an
                            agreement until some clarification had been arranged regarding equipment
                            to be received under the Lease-Lend basic agreement.<note n="22"

                        <p>President Arroyo later confirmed this to me saying that Alfaro’s airmail
                            letter due today might clear up the matter. He added that as we prepared
                            ourselves for the war and his people learned what was going on at
                            Salinas it naturally stimulated a desire for them also to make
                            preparations which was impossible without constructive help from us.
                            Montesinos is returning to Panama tomorrow and will inform General
                            Andrews.</p>

                        <p>121. Your 153, February 25, 9 p.m. The Ecuadoran Ambassador has received
                            a letter from the President of the Republic indicating that apparently
                            the President and his advisers are under the impression that Ecuador
                            under the proposed lend-lease agreement would be expected to repay
                            $17,000,000 over a period of 6 or 7 years. It is difficult to understand
                            how such an impression could exist, since the text of the proposed
                            agreement clearly indicates in Article II that Ecuador is expected to
                            pay only 3.53% of the total, or $600,000 over 6 years, at a rate of not
                            over $100,000 per year. In addition there are no interest payments to be
                            made. The Government of the United States believes that the terms being
                            offered Ecuador are exceedingly generous.</p>
                        <p>The President of Ecuador in his letter asked two questions: (1) Is there
                            any possibility of Ecuador’s having to pay less than $17,000,000? The
                            answer to this is as indicated above. (2) Does the lend-lease agreement
                            include local expenditures and salaries of the Army? The answer to this
                            is no—the lend-lease agreement covers only matériel to be furnished
                            Ecuador from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ecuadoran Ambassador is cabling his Government at once answering
                            these questions.</p>

                            deal directly with the War Department on the materials which it desires.
                            It is believed that President Arroyo’s objection to signing an agreement
                            on the Galápagos, similar to the one signed on January 24 between
                            American and Ecuadoran military authorities on Salinas under the
                            provisions of the general defense agreement, should now be obviated. The
                            War Department believes this agreement on the Galápagos is of the utmost
                            urgency for the defense of the hemisphere. You are requested <pb n="374"
                                xml:id="pg_374" facs="0388"/>to take this question up with the

                            the Ecuadoran authorities, on the basis of which it was urged that most
                            serious consideration should be given to instituting effective measures
                            for the protection of the Galápagos Archipelago and the coast of
                            Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>The contents of the memorandum were at once brought to the attention of
                            the War Department and the Navy Department, which were requested to
                            state whether they had received any information of the character

                                Liaison Officer, David Key, appears as follows: “In a liaison
                                meeting last December, Mr. Welles made known the Ecuadoran
                                Government’s desire that the United States urgently cooperate in the
                                defense of the Ecuadoran coast and the Galápagos and that there was
                                no objection to proceeding in these matters without awaiting the
                                signature of written agreements.”</note> seemed to be working
                            satisfactorily and he assumed that General Andrews had decided that, as
                            in the case of Salinas, it would be better to continue on the present
                            basis rather than to open up negotiations and incur the risk of
                            ultimately obtaining a less satisfactory arrangement. Major Hero pointed
                            out that the decision in this matter rested with General Andrews.</p>

                            been negotiated by the Executive without the necessity for prior
                            consultation with the Congress, that later discussion in Congress was
                            purely informative, and that the same conditions would apply to the
                            Galápagos agreement.</p>

                        <p>At Rio members of the Ecuadoran Delegation declared that the Central Bank
                            was in a precarious situation as a result of loans made to the Ecuadoran
                            Treasury during the boundary dispute, and resulting increases in note
                            circulation and decreases in reserves. We were informed that the Bank
                            had exceeded its limit of loans to the Government, and had less reserves
                            of dollars and gold against notes and deposits than the legal
                            requirement of 30%. On our return to Washington <pb n="384"
                                xml:id="pg_384" facs="0398"/>Dr. Salazar obtained information
                            through the Foreign Office from the President of the Central Bank which
                            would indicate that the gold and dollar reserves of the country are
                            higher than they have been in recent years and that the reserve ratio is
                            actually 61%, making the Bank’s technical position one of the best in
                            all of the American republics. The letter of the President of the
                            Central Bank indicates that total obligations of the Government are
                            38,000,000 sucres, and that this is 5,400,000 sucres in excess of the
                            amount which the Bank is legally empowered to lend to the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Salazar has been urgently requesting a loan of $800,000 (although the
                            equivalent of 5,400,000 sucres is only $360,000) to enable the Ecuadoran
                            Treasury to pay off the Central Bank. He agrees that there are no
                            economic reasons requiring this and even that it would be
                            disadvantageous to the Ecuadoran Treasury to convert a sucre obligation
                            to the Central Bank into a dollar obligation to the United States.
                            Nevertheless he states that commercial shareholders of the Central Bank
                            can make political capital of this situation and that if it is not
                            quickly corrected the Government will face a political difficulty which
                            may be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>The Department and other interested agencies feel that the United States
                            has gone to unusual lengths to support the Ecuadoran economy, and is
                            most unwilling to create the precedent of making such a type of loan,
                            which is obviously undesirable economically. The Government of the
                            United States has never made such a loan, but has always restricted its
                            credits to constructive development or public works programs on the one
                            hand, or to stabilization and other monetary arrangements on the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>In view of the urgency which Dr. Salazar attaches to his request, the
                            Department would appreciate your discussing the matter fully and
                            confidentially with Mr. Glasser<note n="45" xml:id="d410fn45">Harold D.

                        <p>167. Reference Department’s no. 118, February 28, 3 p.m. The following is
                            submitted after consultation with Glasser.</p>
                        <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0399"/>
                        <p>We agree with analysis in cable that the loan request of Central Bank
                            lacks technical basis and is not in best economic interests of Ecuador.
                            The emergency loan of the Government from the Central Bank of 17,000,000
                            sucres in 1941 was guaranteed by a pledge of 1.3 percent of current
                            Government revenues and 60 percent of profits of exchange control and
                            will presumably be paid off in less than 5 years. The emergency loan of
                            14 million sucres in 1942 was guaranteed by a series of new taxes which
                            will yield 14 million before July 1943. By February 28 only 16 million
                            of both loans have been used and Government deposits in Central Bank are
                            running 8 million higher than corresponding period year ago. The
                            Government is meeting all obligations faithfully and there is no
                            technical reason for concern over condition of Central Bank. I am
                            unaware of any public dissatisfaction over emergency loans or of any
                            disturbing consequences likely to arise within the near future. I
                            personally think the Government is really worried about where to secure
                            funds for repaying bank and asked extra amount to be sure it could care
                            for rehabilitation of El Oro.</p>

                                <p>“The Government of the United States is prepared to render
                                    technical and financial assistance in the execution of the
                                    program of the Government of Ecuador for the rehabilitation of
                                    the Province of El Oro. In order to define exactly the nature of
                                    this assistance, and at the suggestion of the Government of
                                    Ecuador, a group of experts is being sent to Ecuador at once to
                                    make a detailed, but rapid, study of conditions in the Province.
                                    This group is composed of an official of the American Red Cross
                                    experienced in relief work, an expert qualified in Farm Security
                                    Administration techniques and a representative of the Office of
                                    the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The group will arrive
                                    in Quito about March 18, 1942.</p>
                                <p>This group of experts, in addition to making the study in
                                    question, will be in a position to render immediate and
                                    practical assistance in matters of major emergency connected
                                    therewith. The assistance which this Government agrees to
                                    furnish in the broad program of rehabilitation will be
                                    undertaken immediately following completion of the survey.”</p>

                        <p>For your confidential information the Department believes that a certain
                            amount of the rehabilitation work can probably be done by the new
                            development corporation on a recoverable basis, hence the original
                            estimate of $1,000,000 for a grant from this Government would be too
                            high. This Government is prepared to grant up to $500,000 if necessary
                            and recommended by the survey group.</p>
                        <p>The survey group will arrive in Quito on March 18. Details by air

                                Executive Secretary, Board of Economic Operations of the Department
                                of State.</note> indicates a very generous program of financial and
                            economic assistance to Ecuador has been embarked upon. It should have
                            more far-reaching effects on the economic life of Ecuador than any
                            program yet agreed upon for any other country. Within a few months this
                            program should be well under way and the effects begin to make
                            themselves evident.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore believed that the only ground for emergency financial
                            assistance is to bolster the Government politically.</p>
                        <p>During the last two days I have endeavored to form a conclusion as to the
                            gravity of the political situation. I have talked with the Ecuadoran
                            Ambassador who has left with me the attached extract from a letter from
                            the President<note n="49" xml:id="d413fn49">Carlos Arroyo del Río,
                                President of Ecuador.</note> to him dated May 22<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d413fn50">Not printed.</note> which the Ambassador hopes
                            that you will read. Others with whom I have spoken do not confirm the
                            impression that the Ecuadoran Ambassador conveys that the political
                            situation has deteriorated drastically during the last few weeks.… These
                            persons in fact believe that the President is in a stronger position
                            today than he was right after the Rio conference.</p>
                        <p>My personal view is that while the President is not in as weak a position
                            as the Ecuadoran Ambassador portrays, he is probably under <pb n="387"
                                xml:id="pg_387" facs="0401"/>considerable pressure from the
                            politicians of El Oro for assistance there and from the military for
                            equipment, et cetera.…</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, if it is decided to give any assistance to Ecuador to help
                            the Government politically, the aid which would produce the greatest
                            political advantage would be a grant of money for the improvement of the
                            housing facilities of the Ecuadoran Army.…</p>
                        <p>With the Army more solidly behind the President, it should be possible
                            for him to ride out the criticism over the rehabilitation of El Oro
                            Province. The report of the experts sent there indicates that the damage
                            of the Peruvian forces was slight because there was very little to
                            damage. The necessity of this province is for the development of new
                            agricultural production which is in general the problem of all Ecuador.
                            The Development Corporation would give preferential attention to the
                            problem of new production in El Oro so that six months from now the
                            criticism of the local politicians … should largely have
                            disappeared.</p>

                            shortages have precipitated general public complaint. He is, therefore,
                            hopeful to learn what practical steps will be taken now that the Del
                            Valle reports mentioned in the Department’s telegram no. 403, June 12,

                            with respect to the next steps to be taken to the end that both
                            Guayaquil and Quito may be informed regarding the procedure to be
                            adopted looking to the rehabilitation of their water systems. It is
                            assumed that dams [<hi rend="italic">plans?</hi>] are sufficiently
                            complete to enable contracting firms to make bids.</p>

                        <p>492. Your 542, July 1, 10 p.m. The Export-Import Bank is now going over
                            the del Valle report in detail. A preliminary estimate of it is that it
                            is a most excellent and comprehensive piece of work upon which the
                            program can go forward. The Department feels strongly, however, that
                            President Arroyo should realize very definitely at the outset that in
                            all probability it will be quite hopeless to obtain materials and
                            machinery for these projects in the United States for the duration of
                            the emergency. The Bank is, however, quite willing to extend the credit
                            with the definite understanding that only such work can be taken prior
                            to the conclusion of the war which will not require American materials
                            and machinery. The Bank will have completed within a few days its
                            estimates of how much work can be done on this basis. At an opportune
                            moment please make this point very clear to the President so that there
                            will be no possibility of future misunderstandings on the score of
                            American materials.</p>

                            the Department has received from the Acting Secretary of the Treasury in
                            regard to the request of the Minister of Finance of Ecuador<note n="61"
                                xml:id="d419fn61">Vicente Illingworth.</note> transmitted by your
                            despatch no. 3024, dated May 25, 1942,<note n="62" xml:id="d419fn62">Not
                                printed; it reported that the Ecuadoran Minister of Finance had
                                failed to advise the United States Treasury Department of a change
                                in the exchange rate of the sucre.</note> for the opinion of the
                            Treasury Department with respect to the interpretation which should be
                            given to paragraph 10 of the Stabilization Agreement of February 27,
                            1942.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I note that the Minister of Finance expresses his disappointment
                                that the interpretation given to paragraph 10 by Dr. Salazar is not
                                in conformity with this Department’s interpretation and in
                                consequence the Ecuadoran Government increased the dollar value of
                                the sucre by approximately 6 percent believing that this would not
                                be regarded by this Department as a “substantial” change in the
                                sense of paragraph 10. I also note that the Finance Minister
                                particularly regrets this occurrence since the change cannot be
                                corrected and since it was never the intention of his Ministry or of
                                his Government to violate the terms of the Agreement.</p>
                            <p>“This Government has an interest in the dollar-sucre exchange rate
                                which is scarcely less direct than the interest which the Ecuadoran
                                Government has in the sucre-dollar exchange rate. Paragraph 10 of
                                the Stabilization Agreement with Ecuador is an expression of this
                                bilateral interest in the exchange rate between the two currencies
                                and requires that the Secretary of the Treasury shall be given an
                                opportunity for consultation before substantial changes in the
                                exchange rate are made.</p>
                            <p>“The Treasury Department takes the position that the abovementioned
                                change in the dollar value of the sucre made by the Ecuadoran
                                Government was a “substantial” change within the meaning of
                                paragraph 10. In fact, a change in the exchange rate of much less
                                than 6 percent may be a “substantial” change. For example, under
                                certain conditions, a change of 1 or 2 per cent in the exchange rate
                                may be expected to have a substantial effect on the delicately
                                balanced financial relationships that normally exist between any two
                                currencies.</p>
                            <p>“I shall appreciate it if you will communicate the above to the
                                Minister of Finance in Ecuador. Please also convey to the Minister
                                my satisfaction in his assurances that no further changes in the
                                dollar-sucre rate of exchange are contemplated unless, after some
                                time, special and important circumstances intervene to require a
                                change. Now that this Department’s interpretation of paragraph 10
                                has been made <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0409"/>clear, I am
                                sure that the Ecuadoran Government will afford me an opportunity for

                            barter agreement which would involve supplying crude rubber from Ecuador
                            in return for authorizing exports of tires from Argentina. The Minister

                            higher prices for Ecuadoran rubber than is being offered in the United

                        <p>168. Your 198 March 14. The attitude of this Government is that it wishes
                            to acquire all Ecuadoran rubber and requests you to take immediate steps
                            to prevent the conclusion of any barter arrangement with Argentina or
                            any other commitment with respect to Ecuadoran rubber. If Ecuadoran
                            authorities agreeable in principle to the sale of rubber to United
                            States, Rubber Reserve willing to enter into an agreement immediately to
                            acquire it and is prepared to offer 35 cents per pound C &amp; F United
                            States continental ports for usual good quality Ecuadoran scrap as
                            understood in New York (otherwise known as Manta or Andulla or Esmeralda
                            Sausage Scrap), with other grades, if any, at appropriate differentials.
                            It is understood that any Hevea type rubber is presumably exported
                            through Brazil and loses its identification as Ecuadoran rubber. Reply

                            rubber. The Ecuadoran Government has been requested to submit terms
                            under which it would be agreeable to establish a Government control and
                            monopoly on the exportation of rubber including minimum f.o.b. Guayaquil

                            expect in return for crude rubber. The Chargé d’Affaires indicated that
                            Argentina would be prepared to establish immediately a credit for 1 to 2
                            million pesos Argentine as a guarantee for the payment of rubber shipped
                            and further indicated that if the Ecuadoran proposals were at all
                            reasonable very little would be required in the way of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Based on prices of actual shipments during February and March it is not

                            could be accepted by the Ecuadoran Government for crude rubber or
                            maroma. Two shipments of washed rubber and pressed rubber were made
                            during March at 72 cents f.o.b. Guayaquil.</p>

                                plan of the Rubber Reserve Company was to purchase through 1946, and
                                this long-range plan offset any immediate price disadvantage.</note>
                            In a long conference the Minister of Finance indicated his approval in
                            principle to the proposal for the purchase of Ecuador’s entire rubber
                            production by the Rubber Reserve Company. I am confidentially informed
                            that before discussing this matter with me the Minister of Finance
                            discussed it with the President<note n="70" xml:id="d427fn70">Carlos
                                Arroyo del Río.</note> and his opinions were authoritative.</p>
                        <p>He stated that in order to construct a portion of trunk road to the
                            principal rubber producing area a fund in excess of $500,000 would be
                            advisable and suggested $1,000,000 but he thought this should be
                            verified by technical studies. He also proposed that a bonus of 7½ cents
                            be paid to the Government on annual purchases in excess of 1,000 tons
                            and a 10 cents bonus on annual purchases in excess of 1500 tons. This
                            would facilitate amortization of the larger cash advance.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance requested a quota for tires for Ecuador but if
                            this is not possible he requested assurance that tires would be
                            allocated to Ecuador to cover needs for essential public service as
                            provided to Americans in the United States plus needs for public
                            transportation in Ecuador. This assurance is necessary to support the
                            Government when announcing a monopoly on the sale of rubber in view of
                            the reported offers by Argentina which includes the supplying of
                            tires.</p>
                        <p>For the same reason he would appreciate receiving details as to the
                            prices agreed upon in the contracts with other Latin American countries
                            for rubber of a quality similar to that of Ecuador. He also asks if
                            price of 35 cents (reference Department’s telegram No. 168, March 7 [<hi
                                rend="italic">17</hi>], 9 p.m.) applies to “Andulla” type or to

                        <p>256. Your 271 of April 8 and 282 of April 10.<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d428fn71">Latter not printed.</note> While anything
                            reasonably designed to increase rubber production, including the trunk
                            road you refer to, will be favored, nevertheless it does not seem
                            appropriate for this to be undertaken by Rubber Reserve out of the fund
                            to be set up by it. This type of project is more closely related to the
                            general development of Ecuador, and we suggest that it be carried out
                            through the Ecuadoran Development Corporation.</p>
                        <p>The bonus payments suggested in your 271 would make the price to Ecuador
                            out of line with other countries, and various other producing countries
                            have requested assurances that no more favorable prices will be granted
                            to the other producing countries. You can readily understand that it
                            seems undesirable to vary the price from country to country for the same
                            type of product without some justification for the difference.</p>
                        <p>You refer to amortization of the larger cash advance. The fund proposed
                            to be set up by Rubber Reserve is not an advance, but a fund to be used
                            to increase production which Ecuador is not obligated to repay. If there
                            are any premiums paid, the amount of the fund not theretofore expended
                            which Rubber Reserve is thereafter bound to provide is reduced by the
                            amount of the premiums. Accordingly, there is no principle of
                            amortization involved.</p>
                        <p>The Government has under consideration the fixing of quotas for the
                            various Latin American countries for the purpose of allocating rubber
                            products to be delivered from here, and while the basis of allocation
                            and the adoption of any such principle generally has not yet been
                            finally determined, in all probability it appears that Ecuador’s
                            essential needs will be provided and its agreement to send us rubber
                            could be conditioned upon this being done.</p>
                        <p>The price offered to Ecuador is the same as that offered the other rubber
                            producing countries for the same grade. All these prices are based on
                            the price agreed upon with Brazil, which is 39 cents per pound f.o.b.
                            Belem for Upriver Acre Fine on a washed and dried basis with appropriate
                            differentials for unwashed types and lower grades. As pointed out in
                            Department’s no. 168 of March 17, 1942, it is understood that Ecuador
                            does not produce any Hevea type rubber except that exported through
                            Brazil. However, if there is any Hevea type rubber of the same grade as
                            the top grade in Brazil, on a washed and <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"
                                facs="0415"/>dried basis, Rubber Reserve Company is prepared to pay
                            the same price as to Brazil.</p>
                        <p>If the Ecuadoran Government would prefer it, Rubber Reserve Company is
                            prepared to pay 33 cents per pound f.o.b. Guayaquil instead of 35 cents
                            c. &amp; f. New York price already quoted.</p>
                        <p>The price quoted is intended to apply both to the Andulla type and to the
                            Maroma grade. It is not possible to quote a price for washed and pressed
                            rubber unless you can give us some information as to type and grade.</p>

                                    manufacture of rubber since Ecuador feels that it must be able

                                    Information is also required regarding the manner in which tires

                        <p>The Secretary of State transmits herewith copies of a draft agreement
                            between Rubber Reserve Company and the Republic of Ecuador,<note n="73"
                                xml:id="d430fn73">Not printed. The draft agreement provided that the
                                Rubber Reserve Company should have an exclusive right to buy
                                Ecuadoran rubber except for an amount stipulated for domestic use.
                                The Company was to pay a fixed price per pound, provide shipping,
                                and establish a fund for developing raw rubber production. Ecuador
                                agreed to prevent hoarding and to provide a fair wage to the
                                laborers. For the text of a similar agreement with Brazil, see
                                telegram No. 640, March 13, 7 p.m., to the Ambassador in Brazil,

                                        >v</hi>, p. 692</ref>.</note> providing for the purchase by
                            Rubber Reserve Company of the exportable surplus of wild rubber produced
                            in Ecuador. The contract has been drafted on the basis of the telegrams
                            recently exchanged between the Ambassador and the Secretary of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that under paragraph 6 of the agreement, a development
                            fund of $500,000 is to be expended by Rubber Reserve Company. In the
                            very near future Rubber Reserve plans to establish an agency in Ecuador
                            in order to correlate all plans of this Government with respect to
                            rubber development work in Ecuador. Such agency would, of course,
                            operate under the supervision of the Embassy and only to the extent
                            approved by the Government of Ecuador. This agency would be under an
                            administrative head and would furnish the technical or advisory
                            assistants referred to in paragraph number one of the Embassy’s telegram
                            344 of April 29, 1942. In addition, this organization would make and
                            carry out all the necessary arrangements relating to the purchase of
                            rubber.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that certain provisions of the contract are given in
                            general terms. In other countries it has been found desirable to
                            commence operations on this basis and to work out the details as the
                            matter proceeds. The organization which it is planned to send to Ecuador
                            will be prepared to discuss and decide these matters, which include the
                            price differentials to be paid for various grades of rubber.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 3 of the draft agreement provides for the fixing of an amount
                            as sufficient to satisfy the essential requirements of Ecuador for
                            rubber products. On the basis of information available here, it appears
                            that, even on a very liberal basis, this amount should be approximately
                            100 tons. It will be noted that the agreement contemplates an increase
                            in this amount for justifiable causes.</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>The proposed agency of Rubber Reserve Company will be fully informed with
                            respect to the conservation measures in effect in the United States,
                            including the information referred to in paragraph two of the Embassy’s
                            telegram no. 344 of April 29.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the Ambassador request the appropriate officials of
                            the Ecuadoran Government to issue an embargo on the export of crude
                            rubber and of rubber products pending the signature of the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that when the form of the contract has been agreed to, it
                            be signed by the Republic of Ecuador and forwarded to the Ecuadoran
                            Embassy here for delivery to the Department to obtain the signature of
                            Rubber Reserve Company. At that time notes would be exchanged here
                            between the Department and the Ecuadoran Embassy confirming the
                            execution of the agreement.</p>

                            and I called on Mr. Illingworth late yesterday afternoon, and he is in
                            accord in principle with all of the conditions outlined in the various
                            instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance stated that it would be necessary to issue a
                            decree by which stocks of rubber would be embargoed and exportation of
                            rubber to any country, except the United States would be prohibited.
                            Provision would be made in the decree for the payment of the price
                            established in the contract for all stocks of rubber now on hand in
                            ports in Ecuador. The decree would also authorize some member of the
                            Government to sign a contract on behalf of Ecuador for the purchase of
                            rubber.</p>
                        <p>The one point regarding which Mr. Illingworth apparently feels somewhat
                            uneasy is the question of rubber which has been purchased by Ecuadoran
                            exporters and which may have been purchased at prices in excess of 33
                            cents. He inquired if there was not some provision <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0418"/>which could be made to protect
                            Ecuadoran exporters who have made legitimate purchases, indicating that
                            the Ecuadoran Government would be prepared to carefully check all such
                            purchases and refuse to give consideration to any cases concerning which
                            there was the slightest doubt. It was emphasized that the Rubber Reserve
                            did not contemplate protecting Ecuadoran exporters and that to do so
                            would establish a precedent which would be very prejudicial to pending
                            negotiations with other countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Illingworth was under the impression that there were probably large
                            stocks of rubber in the ports, but the latest figures that he had
                            covered such stocks as of April 28. Figures which were compiled in the
                            Consulate General indicated that there were approximately 270 tons of
                            rubber on hand as of June 13. It is not believed that stocks in other
                            ports exceed 50 or 60 tons. Thus the rubber exportable at present is not
                            excessive.</p>
                        <p>It was explained to the Minister of Finance that Rubber Reserve had
                            authorized Grace &amp; Company to purchase all available stocks on hand
                            as soon as the agreement was concluded, and that Grace &amp; Company had
                            indicated that in all probability most of the rubber held in ports had
                            been purchased at less than 33 cents per pound. Mr. Illingworth was
                            pleased that arrangements had been made whereby purchases could be
                            undertaken immediately following any decree which might be issued by the
                            Government restricting exports of rubber.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Illingworth indicated that he would immediately discuss the entire
                            matter with the President and the Minister of Agriculture in order to
                            conclude as rapidly as possible the final details in connection with the
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>555. I called on the President this morning to say we had been informed
                            that 172 tons of rubber were being shipped southward from Guayaquil
                            about July 8 and to ask whether decrees as prepared some time ago (see
                            enclosures to despatch No. 3156, June 23)<note n="78" xml:id="d433fn78"
                                >Not printed.</note> could not now be signed, thus carrying out the
                            spirit and substance of our understanding.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion, the President dictated the following which in
                            translation reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Cabinet in three consecutive sessions has been engaged in
                                    the study of the decrees referring to rubber. It has made some
                                    modifications which while preserving in substance the exclusive
                                    exportation to the United States through the Reserve avoid the
                                    constitutional difficulty of declaring a monopoly. The matter
                                    has been settled in a definitive manner. (See solution outlined
                                    in section 3 of this telegram.<note n="79" xml:id="d433fn79">See
                                        penultimate paragraph of this telegram.</note>)</p>
                                <p>The Government has some changes which could be considered of
                                    minor importance or of terminology. The only important change is
                                    with reference to the premiums of 2½ cents (and 5 cents) which
                                    according to the contract would have to be applied to the
                                    unexpended balance of the development fund of $500,000. This
                                    fund is to be spent by Reserve according to its judgment and the
                                    Government of Ecuador complains that if the expenditure does not
                                    depend on this Government it would be unjust for premiums which
                                    it should receive to be applied to the said balance as this is
                                    an expenditure over which it (the Government) has no
                                    jurisdiction. The Government believes that if the contract were
                                    thus drafted the case might arise where it would not actually
                                    receive the premiums if these had to be applied to the
                                    development fund which the Reserve in its judgment might not
                                    have spent.</p>
                                <p>The Government suggests one of the following: (1) that the
                                    expenditure of the development fund be made by the Government in
                                    order that then in case this had not been completed up to 1944
                                    the premiums may be applied to the unexpended balance; (2) that
                                    if it is desired that this expenditure (development fund) be
                                    left to the judgment of the Reserve the payment of the premiums
                                    be independent and be made directly to the Ecuadoran Government,
                                    as said premiums become available.”</p>

                        <p>In continuation the Executive spoke about as follows: the first decree
                            would provide that no rubber shipments could be made save <pb n="406"
                                xml:id="pg_406" facs="0420"/>to countries designated by mutual
                            arrangement. In another decree the President would permit exports only
                            to the order of the Rubber Reserve Company. He concluded: “Now the
                            responsibility is with you. Should your Government accept either of the
                            above suggestions, we will endeavor to sign quickly and might be able to
                            finish the business in a day or two.”</p>
                        <p>The President’s second proposal may offer a formula for definitely
                            concluding the rubber agreement. Carlton<note n="80" xml:id="d433fn80"

                                not printed.</note> Rubber Reserve agrees that premiums do not have
                            to be deducted from unexpended balance of development fund but shall be
                            paid to Ecuadoran Government independently of status of fund and used by
                            Ecuadoran Government for financing the immediate expansion of production
                            and improvement of quality of wild rubber in Ecuador. The amounts so
                            paid should not be used by the Government to increase the price paid to
                            producers, since this may throw out of line prices paid in Ecuador and
                            in neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>If it is necessary to obtain the signature of the agreement within the
                            next day or two, you are requested to inform the Ecuadoran officials
                            that this Government regards it as of the greatest importance that the
                            agreement be concluded immediately. For a period of approximately a
                            month the agreement is supposed to have been ready for signature and no
                            action has yet been taken but instead additional suggestions put forward
                            by the Ecuadoran authorities. In the meantime rubber shipments appear to
                            be continuing to other countries. For instance Consul at Guayaquil in
                            telegram 137 of July 1<note n="82" xml:id="d434fn82">Not printed.</note>

                                of the Rubber Reserve Company.</note> were present he pointed out
                            that under the contract Rubber Reserve agreed to supply the essential
                            requirements of Ecuador and that up to the present time no tires have
                            been received nor has any indication been given as to when these may be
                            expected. This despite shipments of approximately 590 tons of crude
                            rubber to the United States. A shipment 810 tires are now due to arrive
                            from Argentina and criticism of the contract is mounting. The Minister
                            feels that immediate shipments must be made by us in order to counteract
                            this and has suggested the following as a means of expediting
                            deliveries. See the Embassy’s telegram No. 660, August 14, 7 p.m., and
                            Department’s telegram 607, August 19, 11 p.m.<note n="95"
                                xml:id="d439fn95">Neither printed. In his telegram No. 660, the
                                Ambassador asked for information concerning shipments of tires and
                                food needed in Ecuador; in Department’s telegram No. 607, the
                                Embassy was reminded that few Certificates of Necessity for these
                                commodities had been presented (822.24/319, 322a).</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Minister desires to submit a single Certificate of Necessity to
                            Rubber Reserve covering the balance of tires provided in the quota the
                            third quarter. The Certificate of Necessity would specify in detail the
                            number of each passenger car and truck tires according to size which are
                            required to complete this quota and shipment would be made by Rubber
                            Reserve direct to the Office of Priorities and Distribution of
                            Importations regardless of the particular brand, but only recognized
                            first quality tires would be supplied. The Office of Priorities would
                            establish the necessary credit and would assume responsibility for the
                            equitable distribution of shipment among the various dealers. It is
                            requested that an immediate answer be given as to whether the balance of
                            the third quarter quota can be handled in this way. If not, please
                            suggest means by which immediate shipments can go forward for the
                            situation is becoming critical. In any event please indicate
                            approximately how soon some shipments may be expected.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the Minister’s comments reference is made to paragraph 4
                            of the Embassy’s telegram No. 694, August 26, 6 p.m.<note n="96"

                                that Argentina was supplying Ecuador with 900 tires and might
                                eventually acquire a part of Ecuador’s rubber unless the United
                                States acted immediately (811.20 Defense (M)/8619).</note> It is
                            reported by the Ecuadoran representative of the Michelin Company in
                            Argentina who is receiving the 810 tires that his principals announce
                            they can supply approximately 3,500 additional tires for Ecuador. It <pb
                                n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0425"/>is stated that these
                            arrangements are possible in conformity with a reported Argentine decree
                            effective May 1 authorizing the exportation of tires and other products
                            to countries shipping crude rubber to Argentina. It is said that
                            Argentine firms can supply tires up to 25% of the weight of crude rubber
                            received and other products up to 5%. Presumably above shipments would
                            represent 25% of the crude rubber shipped from Ecuador to Argentina
                            between January 1 and July 8. Argentina seems to be doing whatever
                            possible to discredit our contract and it is essential that Rubber
                            Reserve deliver some tires in Ecuador without any delay.</p>

                        <p>736. Your A–66, September 24.<note n="97" xml:id="d440fn97">Not printed;
                                in this airgram the Ambassador commented upon the proposal to turn
                                over to the Ecuadoran Development Corporation for exploitation a
                                wild rubber area that the Rubber Reserve Company was expected to
                                develop.</note> The Department has discussed this matter fully with
                            Rubber Reserve, Board of Economic Warfare, Export-Import Bank and Dr.
                            Moore. It concurs fully in the objective of having the Development
                            Corporation play an active and substantial part in the rubber program.
                            While recognizing the factors pointed out by the Minister of Finance,
                            the urgent need of the United Nations for rubber leads the Department to
                            the view that Rubber Reserve should be permitted to continue its
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>However, in order that the Corporation may be afforded the opportunity of
                            maximum progress in rubber, Rubber Reserve is prepared to agree that the
                            development fund of $500,000 shall be expended by the Corporation in
                            projects approved by Rubber Reserve, the amounts necessary to carry out
                            each particular project to be transferred by Rubber Reserve to the
                            Corporation upon its approval of the project. Provision would be made
                            for periodic accounting by the Corporation to Rubber Reserve for
                            expenditures theretofore made. Rubber Reserve would remain free to
                            continue operations, and Rubber Reserve would establish, in favor of its
                            representatives in Ecuador, credits available for financing operations
                            initiated by Rubber Reserve.</p>
                        <p>This proposal has the merit of carrying out what is understood to have
                            been Illingworth’s expectation at the time the rubber agreement was
                            signed. It also puts the Corporation in a position to take an energetic
                            part in the rubber program. The success of the arrangement will
                            naturally depend to a considerable extent on the ability of the <pb
                                n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0426"/>Corporation and of the Rubber
                            Reserve local representatives to plan their activities to their mutual
                            satisfaction. The Department would anticipate no difficulty in this
                            respect. It will be particularly necessary for them to agree on prices
                            to be paid producers.</p>
                        <p>Moore and Mercereau<note n="98" xml:id="d440fn98">James F. Mersereau,

                            is suggested you advise Rubber Reserve for its confidential information.
                            Moore and Mercereau will discuss the matter with Kinnear upon their

                                    such project. Corporación Ecuatoriana de Fomento shall render to
                                    Rubber Reserve a monthly statement of expenditures made by it

                        <p>814. For Lowry from Rubber Reserve. The following is intended to give you
                            our ideas as to the purpose and scope of development funds. The sooner
                            useful projects can be developed and financed, the sooner we will get
                            rubber.</p>
                        <p>In general development funds may be used for any purpose which will serve
                            to procure more rubber.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The funds may be used for permanent improvements, such as
                                construction of airports, roads, wharves, ship repair units, houses,
                                drainage and health facilities, provided such projects contribute to
                                the production of rubber, and, of course, further provided that such
                                projects shall have been initiated or approved by the appropriate
                                authorities of the governments concerned, to whatever extent the
                                Rubber Agreement and local laws require.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The funds can be used to acquire and repair transportation
                                equipment which will contribute to rubber production.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>They can be used to facilitate distribution of supplies and
                                movement of workers into the producing areas.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>They can be used to make available medicines, foodstuffs and other
                                supplies at less than cost to Rubber Reserve if advisable.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>They can be used to equalize or defray freight and forwarding
                                costs. For instance, if it is desired to stimulate production in the
                                interior, you may use development funds to absorb freight charges
                                either partially or wholly on supplies of rubber between the
                                interior and the f.o.b. buying points.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>You may use development funds to create more powerful incentives
                                for the movement of additional labor into the rubber areas; to
                                improve living and working conditions in producing areas with a view
                                to retaining the laborers now there and increasing their
                                productivity.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The criterion by which such expenditures should be judged is
                                whether there is a reasonable expectation that they will result in
                                giving us additional rubber.</item>

                                already be under consideration, so that rubber will begin to flow to
                                us in greater quantities at the earliest possible date.</item>

                            our previous communications, if sums in excess of this amount are
                            involved, such approval must be obtained. [Rubber Reserve.]</p>

                                were required to block the accounts of Axis nationals, and the
                                Central Bank was authorized to administer these accounts which could
                                be used for certain limited purposes.</note> The Minister is now
                            studying the matter and probably will soon prepare a revised draft
                            decree. From the course of the discussions it seems likely that the
                            draft submitted by the Minister will be considerably changed.</p>
                        <p>In the proposed draft there is a provision which would permit travelers
                            coming into Ecuador from the United States to carry with them amounts of
                            currency not exceeding fifty dollars in any one <pb n="416"
                                xml:id="pg_416" facs="0430"/>month. In view of the fact that we are
                            not well acquainted with the character of the export control which is
                            now in effect in Panama and the United States, we would appreciate your
                            advice as to the desirability of eliminating such a provision
                            entirely.</p>
                        <p>We would also appreciate the Department’s comments with respect to one
                            point raised by the Minister of Finance. The Minister desires some
                            assurance that, if Ecuador requires all persons within the country to
                            deliver all United States money to the Banco Central, such money will be
                            purchased by the United States Government. The Minister feels that this
                            arrangement could be worked out somewhat as follows:</p>
                        <p>Upon delivery of the dollars to the Banco Central, the dollars would be
                            placed in blocked accounts. The persons for whose accounts such deposits
                            were made would be given an opportunity to file proof that these dollars
                            had not come from any Axis source. If the Minister is satisfied with
                            this proof, he would authorize the Banco Central to pay to the depositor
                            an equivalent amount of sucres for the dollars. In this case the dollars
                            would then be transmitted to the Federal Reserve Bank or the Treasury
                            Department by the Banco Central. In cases where the Minister is not
                            satisfied as to the origin of the dollars, he would nevertheless like
                            the dollars to be converted into sucres, the sucres to be retained in
                            the blocked account and not returned to the owner, and the dollars to be
                            sold by the Banco Central to the Federal Reserve Bank. There may well be
                            several objections to this procedure, but it seems desirable that we be
                            in a position to give the Minister a definitive answer in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>As long as Mr. Illingworth remains in office as Minister of Finance, it
                            is believed that the payments of sucres to certain depositors and the
                            retention of sucres in blocked accounts would be carefully controlled.
                            However, if there should be a change in the Ministry of Finance, the
                            situation might be different and there does not seem to be any sound
                            objection to requiring that dollars of uncertain origin be retained in a
                            blocked dollar account in the Banco Central rather than maintaining
                            blocked accounts of sucres.</p>
                        <p>We propose to discuss the matter further with Minister Illingworth upon
                            the basis of the enclosed draft decree.<note n="6" xml:id="d444fn6">Not

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that long before the receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 1251 of
                            July 20,<note n="7" xml:id="d445fn7">Not printed; it concerned the
                                investigation of the Ecuadoran Committee that handled the freezing
                                of Axis assets (840.51 Frozen Credits/6638).</note> we became
                            disturbed because of the receipt of evidence which we deemed to be
                            reliable that the provisions of the Decree of February 9, 1942 were
                            being laxly administered.</p>
                        <p>Our evidence comes from the Consulate General and contact with our
                            British colleagues. It looks like substantial evidence but we must
                            remember that the Decree was virtually a wholesale freezing measure and
                            probably caught a considerable number of accounts, particularly those
                            belonging to Italians who were not regarded (by some) as sympathetic to
                            the Axis.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is suspected that little could be accomplished in the way of improving
                            the administration without direct authorization from the Executive, who
                            is one of Ecuador’s outstanding lawyers, numbering among his former
                            clients many of the leading business people of the country.</p>
                        <p>At the time of deporting Axis nationals we learned some lessons, namely
                            that there was a divergence of opinion as to which of the former clients
                            were pro-Axis. In the light of this experience we are inclined to
                            believe that evidence against firms or even other evidence, which could
                            not stand up under the severe attack of talented lawyers, might possibly
                            be omitted in our initial negotiations and our efforts might preferably
                            be guided along the following lines: <list>
                                <label>

                                <item>That as six months has elapsed since the issuance of the
                                    Decree we would appreciate it if an examination might be made of
                                    the results of the administration under the committees of three
                                    at Guayaquil and Quito, and that we would be disposed to assist
                                    in an examination of the record supplying at our own expense the
                                    American personnel necessary to collaborate in this

                                <item>Should the survey reveal as many violations as we think have
                                    taken place we might possibly then be in a position to continue
                                    our representatives, having them appointed as members of the

                                xml:id="pg_418" facs="0432"/>to take joint action. The Department’s
                            advice on this particular point is requested. It is my own impression
                            that parallel action might accomplish the same results, although I have
                            no objection to the joint action if the Department approves.</p>
                        <p>One of the problems to be faced in the event the Ecuadoran Government
                            should accept our offer to lend a technician to examine the records
                            would be the finding of the individual who could do the job. There are
                            no competent certified public accountants in this country so far as we
                            know, however we are inclined to believe that we could take a member of
                            the staff of the Economic and Reporting Section of the Embassy who has a
                            pretty fair background extending over a period of years.</p>
                        <p>We recognize, of course, that we have no individual who might be as
                            skillful at this particular task as some of the accountants of the large
                            foreign companies located in Ecuador. For example, the British
                            Anglo-Ecuadoran Oilfields Ltd., or the South American Development
                            Company. Possibly one or both would lend a competent technician. If not
                            we might be able to get someone from the Ecuadoran Corporation (Norton
                            Interests) who would be available on a part time basis.</p>

                            proposed decree submitted with your above-mentioned despatch provides
                            that the Minister of Finance may determine whether dollars delivered to
                            the Banco Central del Ecuador may be converted into sucres. It was
                            stressed in the Department’s abovementioned telegram of July 9 that
                            currency held in the Central Bank on that date would be accepted by the
                            United States Treasury Department upon the basis of controls outlined in
                            that telegram being instituted and effectively enforced. It was stated
                            that any other currency should be forwarded to the United States through
                            the Central Bank on a collection basis, except for amounts under $50
                            received from travellers from the United States and except for
                            remittances under $50 received in Ecuador from Ecuadoran citizens
                            working in Panama upon presentation of a letter and the postmarked
                            envelope indicating that <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0433"/>the
                            funds were forwarded from Panama. The Department and Treasury strongly
                            urge that the proposed decree be amended to provide that such currency
                            be accepted by the Central Bank on a collection basis only. No
                            assurances can be given the Central Bank that any currency, except
                            currency held by the Central Bank on July 9, 1942 and amounts under $50
                            accepted from travellers from the United States and remittances under
                            $50 from Panama as described above, will be accepted for redemption in
                            the United States. In this connection you should point out to the
                            appropriate Ecuadoran authorities that practically all of the other
                            American Republics have instituted United States currency controls
                            supplementing those established by this Government and that those
                            controls provide that currency will be accepted on a collection basis
                            only.</p>
                        <p>Relative to your inquiry concerning the provision which would allow
                            travellers entering Ecuador from the United States to carry with them
                            amounts of $50 in any one month, it is the view of the Department and
                            the Treasury Department that such provision is not objectionable.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your unnumbered telegram of August 5, 11 a.m., the
                            matter has been discussed with Treasury and it is felt that the
                            questions raised by you must be answered in the negative. Should this
                            Government accept currency converted by the local Ecuadoran agency,
                            either for free or blocked sucres, special privileges would be accorded
                            to Ecuador which have not been accorded to the other American republics
                            which have already instituted appropriate controls over the movement of
                            dollar currency. It is believed that this Government would be open to
                            criticism if it should thus discriminate at this time between the other
                            American republics in favor of Ecuador. In addition, the U.S. Treasury
                            alone is in a position to determine whether currency is counterfeit.</p>

                        <p>650. The Minister of Finance has submitted to the President for approval
                            a decree regulating dealings in United States currency which conforms
                            with the instructions of the Department<note n="10" xml:id="d447fn10"

                            </note> except that remittance by Ecuadoran workers in any foreign
                            country up to $50 monthly will be accepted up to September 30. Tourists
                            with passports issued by Ecuadoran or American authorities may cash <pb
                                n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0434"/>amounts up to $50 monthly up to
                            September 30. After this date neither provision will be effective. In
                            view of the very limited amounts which will be involved as a result of
                            these modifications and in view of the generally favorable character of
                            the decree it is recommended that no objection be made to these
                            provisions. The Minister of Finance requests that the Treasury
                            Department give assurances that if the United States currency forwarded
                            from Ecuador to the Federal Reserve Bank is found to be of Axis origin
                            this will be returned to the Central Bank to be held in the blocked
                            account of the depositor. He feels very strongly on this point. No
                            indication was given as to what decision the Treasury Department might
                            make. An early reply is requested.</p>

                        <p>610. Your 650, August 11, 9 p.m. Treasury is opposed to making any
                            commitment with respect to currency forwarded by the Central Bank to the
                            United States for collection and found to have an Axis taint. All of the
                            other countries in the Western Hemisphere in a position similar to that
                            of Ecuador have made arrangements which do not provide for the return of
                            Axis tainted currency. If the Finance Minister cannot be induced to
                            change his position, it would be preferable to delay any decision until
                            the currency is actually forwarded to the United States since it is not
                            known at the present time precisely how much, if any, currency of this
                            character will be forwarded. Each case can then be discussed as it
                            arises in an endeavor to work out mutually satisfactory
                            arrangements.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a
                            conference was held this morning by the Ambassador, the Minister of
                            Finance, and the writer, at which time the question of freezing controls
                            was discussed. The Minister of Finance explained that he did not
                            consider there was sufficient time to effectively revise the existing
                            legislation and establish the new system of administration prior to his
                            leaving for Washington. <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0435"/>It was
                            pointed out that it had been hoped that new legislation could have been
                            adopted in order that the freezing controls in Ecuador might be made
                            more effective prior to his departure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Illingworth explained that it was his desire to place the freezing
                            controls under the jurisdiction of the Office of Priorities and
                            Distribution of Importations. He added that the Director General of this
                                office<note n="11" xml:id="d449fn11">Paul Thur de Koos.</note> had
                            recently returned from Guayaquil, where he had made a detailed survey of
                            the situation, and that he had found the Guayaquil office in a very
                            disorganized state. It will apparently be necessary to replace a large
                            part of the present staff of the Guayaquil office. Furthermore, the
                            Director General will leave for Washington on November 9 in order to
                            take up various matters prior to the arrival of the Minister of Finance.
                            The necessity for replacing most of the Guayaquil staff of the Office of
                            Priorities and the absence of the Director General from Ecuador would,
                            in the opinion of the Minister, make it difficult to put into effect new
                            legislation and regulations of a drastic character.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the Embassy’s telegram no. 861 of October 16, 12 [<hi
                                rend="italic">11</hi>] p.m.,<note n="12" xml:id="d449fn12">Not

                            this office, worked up a draft revision of Decree No. 171 of February 9,
                            and also a complete set of regulations to implement the revised decree.
                            This work was done in cooperation with Mr. Friedmann, the technical
                            adviser to the Minister of Finance, and the material was prepared both
                            in English and Spanish. Insofar as possible all of the recommendations
                            contained in the resolutions approved by the Inter-American Conference
                            on Economic and Financial Controls<note n="13" xml:id="d449fn13">For

                            exceptions in either the revised decree law or the regulations. In
                            addition a memorandum explaining the purposes of the decree law and
                            regulations was drafted and all of this material was submitted to the
                            Minister of Finance through Mr. Friedmann. Copies of the suggested
                            decree law, the regulations and of the memorandum are attached.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>The Minister of Finance today stated “You may be sure that I will adopt
                            regulations which will make the control of blocked accounts, et cetera,
                            effective, and this will be done before the end of the year.” It is felt
                            that the Minister is definitely sympathetic to a much more rigid decree
                            law and effective administrative control. He indicated that there might
                            be small points in the draft decree law and regulations which he would
                            find necessary to change, but intimated that the contents in general met
                            with his approval.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0436"/>
                        <p>While it is to be regretted that immediate action can not be expected on
                            the revised control measures, it is felt that the Minister of Finance is
                            entirely sincere in his statement to the effect that measures will
                            definitely be taken upon his return to Ecuador.</p>

                        <p>A–144. Reference is made to discussions with the Ecuadoran authorities
                            which are now in progress relative to the tightening up of the Ecuadoran
                            freezing controls. Information available to the Department indicates
                            that Ecuadoran banks have for some time felt themselves beyond the reach
                            of the Proclaimed List and have continued to make loans to Proclaimed
                            List firms in Ecuador. A specific example of such a loan is contained in
                            your despatch no. 3526, September 16,<note n="15" xml:id="d450fn15">Not
                                printed.</note> wherein you mention a loan by the Banco de Préstamos
                            to Jeremías y Robinson, although it is not completely clear whether this
                            loan was made prior to the date when Jeremías y Robinson was included on
                            the Proclaimed List.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the policy of the Ecuadoran banks to continue to make
                            loans to Proclaimed List firms sustains the existence of those firms and
                            consequently nullifies one of the objectives of the Proclaimed List. It
                            is suggested that if you have not already done so, you should bring this
                            matter up in your present discussions with the Ecuadoran authorities to
                            the end that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent Ecuadoran
                            banks from continuing to make loans to Proclaimed List firms.</p>

                            outlined in this memorandum with Señor Illingworth, the Ecuadoran
                            Minister of Finance, during his recent trip to the United States. During
                            the course of these discussions, it was contemplated that the memorandum
                            would be delivered to Señor Illingworth upon the basis that it was
                            prepared for use in the Department but that it was thought that the
                            memorandum might be helpful to Señor Illingworth in working out the
                            various problems connected with the Ecuadoran freezing controls upon his
                            return to Ecuador. In particular, the Department wished to stress the
                            importance of the role of the Ecuadoran Development Corporation<note

                        <p>It was not found possible to discuss these matters with Señor Illingworth
                            during his initial visit in Washington and it has now been determined
                            that he will not be returning to Washington prior to his departure for
                            Ecuador. It is suggested, however, that, unless you perceive some
                            objection, it may be desirable for you to deliver this memorandum to
                            Señor Illingworth with an explanation of the reasons why it was not
                            possible to deliver it to him in Washington.</p>

                                republics. This concern has been evidenced by Resolution V of the
                                Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Rio de Janeiro in January
                                1941 [<hi rend="italic">1942</hi>]<note n="17" xml:id="d451fn17"

                                Control, held in Washington in the summer of 1942. In general, the
                                primary objectives of these Resolutions fall into two broad
                                categories: (1) the prevention of economic and financial
                                transactions between <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0438"/>each
                                American republic and other nations, particularly nations outside
                                the Western Hemisphere, which may be of benefit to the Axis or to
                                persons whose activities are inimical to the security of the Western
                                Hemisphere, and (2) the elimination from the economic life of each
                                American republic of all undesirable influence of persons whose
                                activities are inimical to the security of the Western Hemisphere.
                                The ultimate goal is, of course, the effective participation by each
                                American republic in a broad program designed to aid in the defense
                                of all the American republics and in the winning of the war.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Ecuador has already, through the adoption of a
                                decree on February 9, 1942, instituted freezing controls and the
                                Department is pleased to learn that discussions have been held
                                recently between the Minister of Finance and representatives of the
                                American Embassy at Quito relative to the adoption of additional
                                measures designed to strengthen and expand the existing Ecuadoran
                                controls and that the Minister of Finance at the present time has
                                under consideration draft texts of a proposed decree and of
                                regulations thereunder.</p>
                            <p>Before the enactment of additional measures there are certain matters
                                which the Department of State feels should be given primary
                                consideration in determining the form in which the decree and the
                                regulations are finally to be adopted.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that persons and firms in Ecuador appearing on the
                                United States Proclaimed List have in their possession or under
                                their control substantial stocks of scarce materials which are
                                urgently required by the Ecuadoran Development Corporation as well
                                as by other deserving firms and persons in Ecuador to carry on their
                                business operations and which are difficult to obtain in sufficient
                                quantity from the United States due to the exigencies of the war
                                effort. The primary function of the Ecuadoran Development
                                Corporation is to assist in the coordination of the resources of
                                Ecuador so that the economy of Ecuador will be strengthened and
                                benefited to the maximum possible degree. However, the Ecuador
                                Development Corporation, pursuant to its agreement with the
                                Export-Import Bank, cannot make purchases or otherwise deal with
                                persons and firms on the Proclaimed List. Consequently, means should
                                be devised whereby the Ecuadoran Development Corporation can carry
                                out its function and acquire and equitably dispose of the scarce
                                materials now held by Proclaimed List persons and firms in Ecuador.
                                It is believed that the most effective way to achieve this result is
                                to provide a means, through vesting, forced sale or liquidation of
                                the assets of such persons and firms, for eliminating their
                                undesirable influence and activity from the economic life of
                                Ecuador, rather than merely to <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                    facs="0439"/>provide for the requisitioning of scarce materials
                                in their possession. Requisitioning alone even though accompanied by
                                effective blocking of funds would only be a temporary and partial
                                expedient, whereas appropriate measures for the elimination of the
                                undesirable influence and activity of such persons and firms would
                                be of permanent benefit to the economy of Ecuador.</p>
                            <p>Such measures will necessarily vary from case to case. In general,
                                however, the types of cases may be divided into three broad
                                categories:</p>
                            <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Those-firms in which minor changes in
                                    organization and personnel will not be sufficient to eliminate
                                    their undesirable influence and activities, but whose continued
                                    business activity is essential to the economy of Ecuador.</hi>

                            <p>In these cases, it will be necessary to reorganize the business
                                organizations completely. This can be done by forcing the sale of
                                the business organizations (or that part which is owned by
                                undesirable persons) to desirable purchasers, the proceeds of the
                                sale to be effectively blocked, the undesirable employees
                                eliminated, the undesirable business connections severed, et cetera.
                                Article 5 of the proposed new decree specifically gives the Minister
                                of Finance the power to force such sales. However, there may be
                                cases in this category where because desirable purchasers cannot be
                                found immediately, or where because a forced sale would not be
                                desirable for other reasons, the Ecuadoran Government may itself
                                desire to operate the business organization on a temporary or
                                permanent basis. In such cases, it might be appropriate for the
                                Ecuadoran Government to consider the advisability of vesting in
                                itself or in some appropriate governmental agency the title to these
                                business organizations (or that part which is owned by undesirable
                                persons) and then take such further steps as may be necessary to
                                cleanse the firms. This procedure could, of course, be used in all
                                cases in this category with sales to desirable purchasers being made
                                in appropriate cases after vesting.</p>
                            <p>Vesting is the procedure utilized by the United States and it has
                                been found to be very satisfactory. When a firm is vested by the
                                United States Government no immediate payments are made to the owner
                                of the property vested. However, the owners may be permitted to file
                                claims with this Government but the disposition of such claims will
                                be determined at some later date, probably at the end of the war.
                                The Ecuadoran Government may for the reasons stated above also wish
                                to utilize this procedure. Should this be the case, it is believed
                                that attention should be given to revising article 5 of the proposed
                                decree so as to make certain that the Minister of Finance, or such
                                agency as he may designate, will have the power to vest. It may be
                                that article 5 already gives the Minister this power, but this is
                                not absolutely clear.</p>
                            <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Those firms in which minor changes in
                                    organization and personnel will not be sufficient to eliminate
                                    their undesirable influence and activities, but whose continued
                                    business activity is not essential to the economy of
                                    Ecuador.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0440"/>
                            <p>In these cases, the primary objective should be liquidation. This can
                                be accomplished through a refusal by the Minister of Finance to
                                license transactions by such firms except for this purpose or by the
                                issuance of directive licenses for this purpose. As a consequence,
                                the business activity of these persons and firms will die out. It is
                                believed that, under article 5 of the proposed decree, the Minister
                                of Finance has sufficient power to carry out this objective.
                                However, it should be noted that in some cases in this category,
                                where the assets of the business are large and important,
                                affirmative participation by the Ecuadoran Government in the
                                liquidation may be advisable. In such cases, it may be desirable for
                                the Ecuadoran Government to vest in itself title to the assets of
                                such business and to carry out the liquidation directly.
                                Consideration has already been given to the vestting procedure under
                                category (1).</p>
                            <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Those firms where only minor changes are
                                    necessary.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>In this category, there are a myriad of cases. For example, there
                                will be those firms who have in the past merely engaged in a few
                                isolated undesirable business transactions. In such cases, the
                                application of the general freezing controls will probably be
                                sufficient. Another example will be business organizations with
                                merely a few undesirable officers or employees or with an
                                undesirable business connection. All that is necessary in these
                                cases will be to eliminate these officers or employees or to sever
                                the undesirable business connection. Here, attention should be given
                                to clarifying the proposed decree in order to be certain that the
                                Minister of Finance has the required authority.</p>
                            <p>Of the utmost importance in the program for eliminating from the
                                economic life of Ecuador the undesirable influence and activity of
                                the above-mentioned persons and firms is the governmental agency
                                through which the program is carried out. It is believed that the
                                Ecuadoran Development Corporation could be utilized very effectively
                                in many of the situations previously discussed. The Corporation, as
                                the agency for coordinating the use of Ecuador’s resources, is
                                ideally equipped to coordinate the disposition of the assets of
                                undesirable persons and firms. The Corporation is in a position to
                                supply funds for the operation of business firms after the
                                undesirable elements have been eliminated. The Corporation is in a
                                position to supply funds to desirable purchasers of the business
                                interests of undesirable persons or firms, where the forced sale
                                technique is utilized and funds are necessary. The Corporation has
                                the technical experts on its staff to operate business firms falling
                                in category (1) and to liquidate those falling in category (2). It
                                is, therefore, suggested that the Minister of Finance may wish to
                                consider utilizing the facilities of the Ecuadoran Development
                                Corporation to assist him in carrying out some of his functions
                                under the proposed new decree.</p>

                            <p>It is believed that, in expanding and strengthening the Ecuadoran
                                freezing controls, special attention should also be given to the
                                establishment of an adequate staff which can devote its full time to
                                these matters. If this is done, it will be possible to strengthen
                                many phases of the Ecuadoran freezing controls, some of which are
                                the following: <list>

                            Salvador an Government to purchase entire production of rubber in El
                            Salvador except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon) necessary
                            for domestic consumption, at price of 35 cents per pound c. and f.
                            United States continental port for usual good quality castilloa rubber
                            as understood in New York, with appropriate differentials for other
                            grades. The term of the agreement would be for 5 years, prices being
                            subject to adjustment after 2 years by mutual agreement if conditions
                            change. The Government of El Salvador would agree to restrict export
                            licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees. The exportation of
                            manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the United States.
                            El Salvador would agree to use its best efforts to cause maximum amount
                            of rubber to be produced and made available for sale to Reserve. Local
                            labor would be financed locally for necessities for collecting rubber.
                            Some Salvadorean agency might be designated as the single buying agency
                            under the contract, if this seemed best way of securing results;
                            otherwise sales would be made through usual trade channels now in
                            existence. Price on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as local
                            sales price.</p>

                                    transcribing a communication from the Minister of the United
                                    States of America, stating that his Government was ready to make
                                    arrangements with our Government for the exclusive purchase of
                                    the total rubber production of this country, excepting the
                                    amount needed for domestic consumption, at the rate of $0.35 per
                                    pound, c &amp; f, United States continental ports; this
                                    agreement would be for a term of five years and export licenses
                                    would be extended to the above mentioned Company only. In reply
                                    I beg to state that, according to statistics prepared by the
                                    General Customs Bureau (Dirección General de la Renta de
                                    Aduanas) on the exportation of Salvadorean rubber during the
                                    years 1930 to 1939, our rubber production is very meager and it
                                    is <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0444"/>scarcely sufficient
                                    for the national industry which manufactures soles and heels,
                                    raincoats and dresses. Nevertheless, should there be a surplus
                                    in the national rubber production, our Government would accept
                                    the offer of the Rubber Reserve Company, provided that the
                                    minimum price be $0.35 per pound and that the maximum price to
                                    be quoted from prices of the New York Exchange on the day or
                                    date of each contract. As the note under reference suggests that
                                    a Governmental bureau would be established to purchase all the
                                    rubber produced in the country and export it to the Rubber
                                    Reserve Company, it is thought convenient that the Mortgage Bank
                                    of El Salvador could be nominated for this purpose, as it is in
                                    contact with different agricultural and industrial circles of
                                    the country.”</p>

                        at Washington February 2, 1942 (not printed), provided that El Salvador was
                        to repay 54.88 percent of the scheduled cost (about $1,640,000) of the
                        armaments and munitions transferred by the United States to El Salvador in
                        installments for a total of not more than $150,000 before January 1, 1943;
                        $300,000 before January 1, 1944; $450,000 before January 1, 1945; $600,000
                        before January 1, 1946; $750,000 before January 1, 1947; or $900,000 before
                        January 1, 1948. The agreement, otherwise, is substantially the same as the

                        <p>27. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="1" xml:id="d455fn1">Carlos
                                Salazar.</note> has just informed me that President Ubico had
                            requested him to approach me confidentially regarding the possibility of
                            securing for Guatemala arms and military equipment under the Lease-Lend
                            plan. The President proposes for consideration the loan from the United
                            States Government of the materials included in the list which was
                            prepared by Generals Sierra and Mendoza last June while in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>President Ubico said, “If we are at war with the aggressor powers, it is
                            to cooperate with the United States in its defense, therefore it seems
                            only equitable and just that in view of the Lease-Lend Act,<note n="2"

                            United States Government should lend Guatemala what she needs to arm
                            herself so she may be ready for that defense. Upon the end of the war,
                            in the most honorable way, whatever has been received by Guatemala as a
                            loan will be returned to the United States Government and the Guatemalan
                            Government would pay for whatever it has taken over for its own use or
                            which has been damaged in any way”.</p>

                            under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act, and that the Minister is
                            requesting full power to sign the basic agreement on behalf of his
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of such an agreement, which now requires only the consent
                            of the Guatemalan Government, constitutes the essential prerequisite for
                            the delivery of this equipment for which Guatemala would pay a certain
                            stipulated amount.</p>

                            to make an exception in the case of Guatemala.</p>

                            No. 2602 of March 4, 1942 (File No. 711/824.2),<note n="7"

                            reaction of the Guatemalan Government to the observations contained in
                            the Department’s telegram No. 78 of February 19, 9 p.m., 1942, the
                            substance of which was conveyed to the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs in a Note of February 20, 1942, regarding the furnishing of
                            military equipment to this Republic.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office by a Note No. 3229 of March 6, 1942, a copy and
                            translation of which are enclosed, has now made formal reply setting
                            forth its point of view relative to the type of engagement which it
                            deems appropriate for the procurement of the arms and ammunition. It may
                            be observed that the spirit and sense of the formal reply closely
                            approximates that of the preliminary response as contained in the
                            President’s oral statements and the Ministry’s Memorandum<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d459fn8">Not printed.</note> summarizing negotiations in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>No material technical difficulty should be encountered in supplying the
                            Guatemalan Government with the equipment it desires for its own
                            immediate military needs and for which it proposes to pay cash. The
                            matter of the larger amount of equipment which Guatemala needs for
                            cooperation with the United States Government in hemisphere defense
                            presents a much more difficult problem. It occurs to me that this phase
                            might possibly be solved by an arrangement whereby Guatemala would
                            secure the equipment under the normal terms of the Lend-Lease Act,
                            without any exceptions of principle in its favor which might be
                            considered as unfair departures by other American Republics, but at the
                            same time the contract to be so drawn as to afford in substance the end
                            sought by Guatemala. Concretely, it is suggested as a compromise that
                            perhaps Guatemala might be induced to make small installment payments
                            over the usual period of years, with the proviso that at the end of the
                            war the Guatemalan Government would be permitted, as it evidently
                            desires, to return to the United States such equipment as it has not
                            expended and which is in good condition. The value of the equipment so
                            returned would be credited against the obligation contracted by this
                            Republic under the Lend-Lease Act. If the amount of equipment returned
                            were to exceed the monetary balance due by Guatemala subsequent to
                            installments effected, the sum of the excess would be refunded to the
                            Guatemalan Treasury. If the equipment returned were not sufficient to
                            liquidate the monetary balance due, the Guatemalan Government would be
                            obligated to discharge the sum of the deficit. Such a proposal of course
                            presupposes, on the side of the United States, that the arrangement is
                            legally possible and within the policy adopted, and, on the Guatemalan
                            side, that the installment payments called for would be so spaced and in
                            such moderate amounts that the demands could be met by Guatemala within
                            its extraordinary budgetary resources and without resort to public
                            loans.</p>
                        <p>I do not know whether such a plan would be agreeable to the Guatemalan
                            authorities. Doubtless the Department may evolve a more satisfactory
                            arrangement, the present suggestion being advanced by me merely as one
                            solution which might merit exploration and without any attempt to pass
                            on the justice of Guatemalan pretensions. The ostensible value of the
                            plan, which the Legation ventures to submit for examination, is that the
                            United States would be assured of payments in keeping with the
                            provisions of the Lend-Lease Act and Guatemala would obtain acceptance
                            of its contention that it be not obliged to pay for arms and ammunition
                            over and above its immediate needs and which are not actually expended
                            by it.</p>

                                memorandum from the Legation of the United States dated February 20
                                last, relative to the matter of furnishing arms in accordance with
                                the lend-lease act.</p>
                            <p>The Ministry had delayed replying to the kind memorandum of the

                                The questions which arose having been elucidated, the Minister is
                                today able to make a clarifying and definitive reply with regard to

                                contract submitted for its consideration.</p>
                            <p>The President of the Republic has taken up directly with His
                                Excellency the Minister of the United States the different phases of
                                the pending negotiations; and His Excellency the Minister is aware

                                it believes that it will be advantageous and useful to state as
                                clearly as possible the attitude of the Government of the Republic
                                regarding the matter of arms.</p>

                            <p>The Government of Guatemala is grateful for the benevolent offer of
                                the United States to furnish to it armament and munitions of war;
                                and declares that, as regards arms which it needs for its own

                            <p>A simple and clear contract could be drawn up setting forth exactly

                                United States has placed itself in the crusade for liberty and human
                                rights. Notwithstanding the danger of thereby attracting attacks of
                                totalitarian forces, airports and coasts of the Republic have been
                                fortified or are being fortified for the defense of the
                                continent.</p>
                            <p>It is logical, as a consequence of the measures of military nature
                                that, in order to collaborate with the United States forces
                                presently and in the future on Guatemalan soil, the Guatemalan Army
                                needs to import arms adequate for the defense which is being
                                organized: The Government of the Republic deems that its conduct in
                                this matter is to cooperate with the United States in the collective
                                defense; it does not consider it just that, under the circumstances
                                referred to in the preceding paragraph, the armament which may have
                                been ceded to it for mutual defense and which may be in good
                                condition and not needed after the cessation of hostilities, should
                                be an expense to the Guatemalan Government.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Guatemala has been referring to this type of
                                armament, as His Excellency the Minister of the United States will
                                recall, with the insistent request that such matériel be furnished
                                as a loan under the United States law of March 11, 1941, with the
                                option of returning it after the war, provided it is in good
                                condition or unused.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Guatemala has not pretended that, under similar
                                circumstances, it be given advantageous concessions over the other
                                American Republics. Now, by reason of the explanations made, whether
                                orally or in the extract of the diplomatic correspondence which the
                                Ministry for Foreign Affairs had the honor to place in the hands of
                                His Excellency the Minister of the United States, it (the Ministry
                                for Foreign Affairs) understands that the matter is elucidated and
                                crystallized in the aforementioned terms.</p>
                            <p>In summary, the Government of Guatemala is disposed: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>To buy arms which it needs for its own defense and local
                                        use, paying cash;</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>To obtain under the terms of the lend-lease law, arms
                                        which are needed to collaborate with the United States in
                                        the defense of the American continent.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>As has been explained, the Government of Guatemala has hastened to
                                place at the service of collective defense all the national
                                resources <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0453"/>which are
                                necessary to repel direct aggressions of the Axis powers: In order
                                to fight against those forces, the Government of Guatemala will have
                                to make great sacrifices over and above the material damages which
                                the aggressors may cause. This not being exactly the case of the
                                other American Republics which have already signed contracts for
                                arms with the United States, and, on the other hand, which probably
                                will not pay cash for those for local use only, the Government of
                                Guatemala does not see the reason why those Republics should find
                                unfair the conditions proposed by Guatemala. Moreover, if Guatemala
                                gives as much as it has and proposes the return after the war of the
                                arms in good condition or unused, it surely is not seeking a
                                unilateral agreement for the exclusive benefit of Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs takes this opportunity to reiterate
                                to the Legation of the United States the assurances of its highest
                                and most distinguished consideration.</p>

                            Serafín Montesinos<note n="9" xml:id="d460fn9">United States Army
                                officer, in Guatemala for the negotiation of a provisional agreement
                                with Guatemala regarding United States Army bases in that
                                Republic.</note> were good enough to come to this Ministry to
                            discuss the plan of cooperation by which Guatemala would take part in
                            the defense of the Caribbean, I had the honor, under instructions from
                            the President of the Republic, to present a counter-proposal<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d460fn10">Not printed.</note> which basically was in accord
                            with the thought developed in the clauses of the proposal<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d460fn11">Not printed.</note> drawn up by the Caribbean
                            Defense Command.</p>
                        <p>I also had the opportunity to give full explanations which justified the
                            modification of some of the clauses of that proposal, as regards its
                            external form, with the object of protecting ourselves—the Government of
                            Guatemala as well as the great Republic to the North—from malicious
                            comment from our enemies.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it was necessary to propose an article of a compensatory
                            character which seemed to be just to the President inasmuch as the
                            assistance which is now asked of Guatemala and which the Republic will
                            grant with pleasure, has substantially changed that which had previously
                            been requested and likewise granted.</p>
                        <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>I consider that the reasons which prevailed when that article was drawn
                            up will have a part in forming a complete and exact concept of the
                            contents of Article 18 of the counter-proposal of the Government of
                            Guatemala. I desire to express these reasons in this Note with the
                            request that they be incorporated in the report which Your Excellency
                            will send to his Government in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I. When my Government requested that of Your Excellency to give to
                            Guatemala as a loan certain armament in conformity with the Lend-Lease
                            Act, the Department of State replied that the proposal seemed unilateral
                            and that, in case Guatemala were given what it requested, the rights of
                            the other Hispano-American Republics which had acquired armament through
                            purchase in accordance with the draft contract which had been drawn up,
                            would surely be injured.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State added that it could not make any transaction if
                            the Government of the United States did not receive some compensation in
                            money, work, or other form equivalent to money.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Guatemala believed on that occasion that it had offered
                            cooperation which was of benefit, utility and advantage to the
                            Government of the United States: The La Aurora airport had been placed
                            at the disposition of the Government of the United States for military
                            purposes; the open and unlimited concession had been granted for vessels
                            and planes of war and for officers and troops of the United States
                            crossing Guatemalan territory to do so without reservation and without
                            prior notice, as they had previously done; the highways which crossed
                            the country, particularly the Pan-American which is complete from the
                            Mexican border to the border of El Salvador, as well as the railways
                            which communicate between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean and
                            from the Mexican border to that of El Salvador, all were placed at the
                            disposition of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Republic held various friendly conferences with Your
                            Excellency, having explained that the Guatemalan Government needed
                            certain armament for its local and limited use for the purpose of
                            internal defense; such armament would be paid for at a reasonable price
                            with money and for cash. But the additional armament which would
                            certainly be required in the event that the Government of the United
                            States needed the cooperation of armed troops which the Guatemalan
                            Government could put under arms, to the number of 40,000 to 60,000 men,
                            it was considered should, in equity, be loaned in accordance with the
                            Lend-Lease Act to be returned at the termination of the conflict
                            provided that they were in good usable and conserved condition. That
                            which was destroyed, used or made useless, would then be paid for by the
                            Government of the Republic.</p>
                        <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>Such was the plan which was under study and which, with the kind
                            assistance which His Excellency Minister Des Portes was good enough to
                            offer since he considered the proposal of the Government of Guatemala to
                            be just, awaited the final word which the Government of the United
                            States might give.</p>
                        <p>II. At this stage of the matter, Colonel Montesinos brought a draft of
                            the full plan by which the Republic of Guatemala and its Government was
                            to grant to that of the United States, for the defense of the Caribbean
                            and the Panama Canal principally, the concessions set forth in each of
                            the articles or clauses which that draft contained.</p>
                        <p>The simple reading of the plan brought by Colonel Montesinos reveals that
                            the assistance which the Guatemalan Government had voluntarily offered
                            that of the United States, is augmented and amplified considerably:

                                    United States.</p>

                        <p>Even though this last point would be under the heading of reciprocity,
                            such reciprocity does not exist because the Government of Guatemala has
                            no vessels, fleet and air squadrons to use ports and air fields of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>This plan also requests the authorization of the Government of Guatemala
                            to: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>the Government of Guatemala would agree to the organization of a

                                    of American military works, and this commission would lend

                        <p>III. The equitable principle of compensation had been used by the
                            Government of the United States to deny to the Government of Guatemala
                            the provision of armament required to cooperate with the United States
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>It appears to be reasonable that the Government of Guatemala now invokes
                            this principle, in order that it be granted as its property, the
                            armament and munitions which are listed on list No. 1 which I had the
                            honor to send to Your Excellency with a copy of the counterproposal of
                            this Government; and that it be granted as a loan, the munitions and
                            arms set forth in list No. 2, which I was pleased to send to Your
                            Excellency, in entire conformity with the United States Lend-Lease
                            Act.</p>
                        <p>I wish to invoke the perfect understanding which the Minister of the
                            United States, His Excellency Mr. Des Portes, has of the Government of
                            the Republic of Guatemala, in order that it may have the certainty that
                            this Government is not animated in a spirit of gain or commercialism,
                            which is very far from being the motive of its cooperation: operations
                            of mutual advantage and equity are concerned, and by no means a
                            unilateral gain that the Government of Guatemala in any form
                            contemplates.</p>
                        <p>The sincerity which I owe to the good will and upright spirit of justice
                            which I am pleased to recognize in His Excellency the Minister of the
                            United States, leads me to hope that he will be the interpreter of the
                            sentiments of my Government before the Government of the United States,
                            in order that on discussing and studying the Guatemalan
                            counter-proposal, a decision may be adopted which will be in accord with
                            the sentiments of reciprocal friendship and decided assistance which
                            guide the procedure of both Governments.</p>
                        <p>On this new occasion I beg of Your Excellency to accept the assurances of
                            my highest consideration and singular appreciation.</p>

                            States of America and the Government of Guatemala, shall have the

                            military zones for mutual defense.</p>
                        <p>The benefits granted by this Article and the materials, merchandise and

                            in part, to private persons or businessmen in the Republic of
                            Guatemala.</p>

                            individuals who may have acted contrary to the law or police
                            regulations.</p>
                        <p>Article 17. In the event that the Government of Guatemala should require
                            some cooperation similar to that which it is affording to the armed

                            States of America will agree to grant it, provided it is within the
                            scope of inter-American cooperation.</p>

                            commitment with Guatemalan Government to purchase entire production of
                            rubber in Guatemala except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon)
                            necessary for domestic consumption, at price of 35 cents per pound c.

                            rubber as understood in New York, with appropriate differentials for
                            other grades. The term of the agreement would be for 5 years, price
                            being subject to adjustment after 2 years by mutual agreement if
                            conditions change. The Government of Guatemala would agree to restrict
                            export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees. The
                            exportation of manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the
                            United States. Guatemala would agree to use <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452"

                            be produced and made available for sale to Reserve. Local labor would be
                            financed locally for necessities for collecting rubber. Some Guatemalan
                            governmental agency might be designated as the single buying agency
                            under the contract, if this seemed best way of securing results;
                            otherwise sales would be made through usual trade channels now in
                            existence. Price on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as local
                            sales price.</p>

                                xml:id="d467fn29">

                                172</ref>.</note> regarding the extreme urgency of the rubber
                            situation and to report that during a conversation with President Ubico
                            a few days ago, I read to him portions of that telegram. The President
                            was most interested, and informed me that he would lend every possible
                            aid to the United States Government in the critical situation.</p>
                        <p>With specific regard to the agreement which the Rubber Reserve Company
                            desires to effect for the purchase of Guatemala’s entire rubber
                            production, (Department’s telegram No. 104 of March 19, 2 p.m.) the
                            President observed that although it is against the constitution of the
                            Republic for the Guatemalan Government to enter into any monopoly,
                            considering the war emergency he will make this an exception. The
                            President continued by saying that there are no <pb n="453"
                                xml:id="pg_453" facs="0467"/>large rubber plantations in the
                            Republic but that there are very considerable quantities of wild rubber
                            scattered throughout the country. He stated that for this reason he is
                            afraid the cost of production will prove considerably more than the
                            price now being offered by the United States Government. He explained
                            that in the jungles one would find a rubber tree and then would probably
                            have to go a distance of perhaps one-fourth of a mile before finding
                            another tree large enough to tap. He further stated that on his own <hi
                                rend="italic">finca</hi>, several months ago, he had his Indians go
                            out into the jungles to gather wild rubber, that they brought back fifty
                            pounds, which cost him for the labor alone three Quetzales (three
                            dollars), but that after the rubber was washed and rolled sufficiently
                            to make it of a first-class grade, the net result was that he had only
                            ten pounds of first-class rolled rubber.</p>
                        <p>I asked the President if he would be willing to make an immediate survey
                            of the Republic in order to find out about what production may be
                            obtained and the approximate cost of production. The President expressed
                            his willingness to make the survey, but explained that such a survey
                            could not be effected until the rainy season begins around the middle of
                            May. In elucidation he said that the sap in the rubber tree does not
                            flow in good quantities until after the rains have set in. The President
                            promised to give me a report as soon as the survey was completed.</p>

                        <p>191. Your report 2734 of April 8. Contracts have now been executed with
                            Brazil, Peru and Nicaragua and agreements in principle have been reached
                            with Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica and certain other countries.
                            Negotiations are proceeding in all other producing countries with
                            Guatemala practically the only exception. It is feared here that if
                            negotiations with Guatemala are postponed further less than maximum
                            amount of rubber will be obtained this year. If the experiments referred
                            to in your report are not yet completed, would it not be possible to
                            execute an agreement at the price suggested with a provision that if the
                            price so fixed should prove inequitable or fail to provide the producers
                            with an appropriate profit, the price would be subject to revision by
                            agreement between the parties.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                                <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> which Your Excellency was so
                            good as to transmit the 10th of June, relative to the possible
                            development and exportation to the United States of rubber existing in
                            the forests of the republic.</p>
                        <p>In order to reply to Your Excellency I first addressed the Ministry of
                            Agriculture so that they might furnish the statistical information or
                            approximate calculations on the production of rubber and its cost.</p>
                        <p>I have today received from the Minister of Agriculture the information
                            which I take pleasure in transcribing to Your Excellency and which
                            textually reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows report from the Minister of Agriculture on rubber
                            production and costs.]</p>
                        <p>With regard to the contract which the Government of the United States
                            desires to be signed by this Government of Guatemala with the Rubber
                            Reserve Company, I must state to Your Excellency, with especial
                            instructions of the President of the Republic, that this Government is
                            willing to deliver to the Government of the United States or to the
                            person or entity which the Government of the United States designates,
                            all the rubber production which may be gathered in the forests of
                            Guatemala, without limitation except the quantity necessary to satisfy
                            the small industries of the country. The Government is disposed to
                            obligate itself, because it has dictated a law by which the Government
                            is the only one who can buy rubber from persons engaged in its
                            extraction, without other conditions than the willing and cooperative
                            offer of the President of the Republic to deliver the Guatemalan rubber
                            production to the Government of the United States in order that this
                            (Government) take advantage of it as it sees fit.</p>
                        <p>The cost of production is not the same in the various groves of the
                            Republic, because there are no planned plantings of the trees producing
                            rubber, since they are found in a wild state in the interior of the
                            forests and there is a great difference in the effort, work and cost of
                            the rubber obtained from the accessible forests in the nearby
                            departments and the rubber which is gathered in the heart of the distant
                            and solitary forests in the Department of the Petén. However, <pb
                                n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0469"/>to the cost of Q.30.00 and
                            Q.35.00 per quintal, there would have to be added the modest profit for
                            those who gather the rubber, it being noted that the Guatemalan
                            Government will not receive for itself any merchant’s profit, but only
                            the profit of its willing cooperation in the common work of defense of
                            the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing explanations I desire to state to Your
                            Excellency that this Note, written under the instructions of the
                            President of the Republic, should be considered as the contract which
                            requires the Government of Guatemala to deliver the rubber production to
                            the Government of the United States under the sole condition of paying
                            its cost and an equitable profit of 10% for those who gather it in the
                            heart of the forests.</p>

                            still insists that exchange of diplomatic notes serve in lieu of formal
                            contract, that Government alone may buy and sell, that no tonnage be
                            fixed for domestic use and that 10% of cost of production accrue to
                            Government. Guatemala proposes to use all possible means to increase
                            production, to designate chicle companies and United Fruit Company to
                            make payments to producers, to limit domestic use to maintenance of
                            essential industries and to sell all surplus to Reserve.</p>
                        <p>I fear many Pacific planters will not tap for the Government and that 10%
                            profit to the Government will make price in Petén too low to compete
                            with chicle. Nevertheless in order to get started I join American
                            Minister in recommending acceptance Guatemalan note 7719 transmitted
                            with despatch no. 2988,<note n="34" xml:id="d470fn34">Despatch not

                        <p>251. From Holt for Bicknell, Rubber Reserve. Since my telegram of July 15
                            have had Reserve’s views explained to President personally and have
                            today presented another memorandum through Foreign Office. As outlined
                            in President’s formal approval following points already agreed in
                            principle: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Reserve will establish agency whose records will be open to

                                <item>Reserve will sign agreement with whatever office designated by
                                    Government.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>Rubber exported to the United States will pay no Guatemalan
                                    duties or taxes.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>Reserve may buy directly from any producer authorized by
                                    Government to exploit rubber.</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>Reserve will determine with the Government the tonnage
                                    indispensable for domestic consumption and deliver it to
                                    designated factories at export prices.</item>
                                <label>(6)</label>
                                <item>Base price will be 33 cents f.o.b. ports for scrap with
                                    premium for higher qualities.</item>
                                <label>(7)</label>
                                <item>Reserve will work with Government to maintain customary wage
                                    levels.</item>
                                <label>(8)</label>
                                <item>Reserve will guarantee base price until end of 1946 unless
                                    revised after 2 years by mutual agreement.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>An agreement formalizing these points will give Reserve workable basis
                            for operations and practically everything included in your draft except
                            limitation of domestic consumption to fixed tonnage. Actually domestic
                            consumption will be low and other controls may be used if necessary.
                            Recommend acceptance of points outlined and request immediate
                            telegraphic authority to sign the agreement based on them. Must strike

                                transmitting the text of the Treaty of Commerce between Haiti and
                                the Dominican Republic signed on August 26, 1941 and requesting the
                                comments thereon of the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In a memorandum dated December 5, 1941, which was communicated to the
                                Minister of Haiti in Washington and to the Ministry of Foreign
                                Affairs of Haiti, it was pointed out that the most-favored-nation
                                provisions of the first paragraph of Article VII of the trade
                                agreement of March 28, 1935 between the United States and Haiti
                                require that the tariff reductions which would be accorded to the
                                Dominican Republic under the new treaty be extended to the United
                                States. It was also stated in the memorandum that the Government of
                                the United States, in the light of the action taken on September 18,
                                1941 by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory
                                Committee, recommending a contractual formula for tariff preferences
                                to contiguous countries, would give further study to the matter with
                                a view to determining to what extent it would be warranted in
                                waiving its rights under the most-favored-nation provisions of the
                                trade agreement.</p>
                            <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0476"/>
                            <p>As a result of further study, this Government is glad to be able to
                                propose a solution of the matter by an exchange of notes with the
                                Government of Haiti, along the lines of the enclosed draft notes, in
                                which the Government of the United States would agree not to invoke
                                the pertinent provisions of the trade agreement for the purpose of
                                claiming the benefits of the tariff preferences to the Dominican
                                Republic provided for specifically in the Treaty of Commerce signed
                                on August 26, 1941. It would of course be understood that if such
                                preferences should be extended by Haiti to any country other than
                                the Dominican Republic they would be extended immediately and
                                unconditionally to the United States.</p>
                            <p>This Government will continue, of course, to reserve its rights under
                                the most-favored-nation provisions of the trade agreement with
                                regard to tariff preferences to the Dominican Republic not
                                specifically provided for in the Treaty of Commerce.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            instruction no. 353 of January 12, 1942, 638.3931, setting forth that
                            the Department is prepared to waive its rights to most-favored-nation
                            treatment in regard to certain commodities mentioned in the
                            Dominican-Haitian Treaty of Commerce signed August 26, 1941, as per the
                            draft memorandum and exchange of notes attached to the instruction.</p>
                        <p>The instruction authorizes me to transmit the memorandum and draft to the
                            Haitian Government.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I am informed that the following countries would be
                            entitled to claim most-favored-nation treatment from Haiti, in addition
                            to the United States:—France, Holland, the United Kingdom of Great
                            Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Belgium, Luxemburg, Denmark,
                            Iceland, Greenland and Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>The Banque Nationale is fearful of the effects of the tariff reductions,
                            to be accorded by this Treaty to the Dominican Republic, upon Haitian
                            revenues.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with President Lescot, the latter indicated that he was
                            not disposed to promote the ratification of the Treaty at this time and
                            that the Dominican authorities are also now considerably less
                            enthusiastic than formerly. He, therefore, expressed a preference that,
                            if possible, I should not bring the Department’s waiver of
                            most-favored-nation treatment to the attention of the Haitian Government
                            for the present. The effect of such non-action would be that, if the <pb
                                n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0477"/>question of the Treaty were to
                            be raised by the Dominican Government, the Haitian Government could
                            reply that it had not yet heard from the State Department.</p>
                        <p>Unless, therefore, the Department expresses its wish that I should notify
                            the Haitian Government formally as to its willingness to effect a waiver
                            of the most-favored-nation clause, I shall assume that the authorization
                            contained in instruction no. 353, above-mentioned, is optional and not
                            mandatory, and shall take no action.</p>

                        <p>I am happy to note that Your Excellency, in the light of the
                            recommendations of the 18th of September, 1941, of the Inter-American
                            Financial and Economic Consulting Committee, is willing not to invoke
                            the disposition of the commercial agreement signed the 28th of March,
                            1935, between our two countries, which permit it to claim the tariff
                            benefits accorded to the Dominican Republic, with the reserve that, if
                            such benefits should be extended to another country, they should be
                            immediately and unconditionally extended to the United States and also
                            with the reserve of the rights of the American Government as regards any
                            tariff benefits for the Dominican Republic, other than those specified
                            in the Treaty of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>I take pleasure in sending to Your Excellency the note by which the
                            Haitian Government requests that of the United States to consent, in the
                            light of these considerations, not to invoke the provisions of the first
                            paragraph of Article VII of the Commercial Agreement of March 28,

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Legation’s
                            despatch no. 795 of February 4, 1942, regarding the proposed exchange of
                            notes by which this Government would waive its most-favored-nation
                            rights under the trade agreement with Haiti in respect of tariff
                            preferences accorded by the latter to the Dominican Republic in the
                            Haitian-Dominican Treaty of Commerce signed August 26, 1941.</p>
                        <p>The Legation reports that, apparently having in mind loss of revenue to
                            Haiti which might result from the treaty, President Lescot has suggested
                            that the Legation withhold official transmittal of the draft exchange of
                            notes to the Haitian Government and thus enable the latter to present to
                            the Dominican authorities as a reason for postponing ratification of the
                            treaty the excuse that the United States has not yet officially replied
                            to Haiti’s request for its views on the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion such an excuse would place this
                            Government in a false position. The facts are that this Government has
                            raised no objection to the treaty on the basis of the provisions of the
                            Executive Agreement of September 13, 1941,<note n="9" xml:id="d477fn9"
                                >Executive Agreement Series No. 220; 55 Stat. (pt. 2) 1348; for
                                correspondence regarding this agreement, see <ref

                            it is prepared to release Haiti from its most-favored-nation obligations
                            under the trade agreement in respect of tariff preferences granted to a
                            contiguous country in accordance with the formula recommended by the
                            Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee. If the Haitian
                            Government should give the Dominican Government an impression contrary
                            to these facts, our relations with the Dominican Republic might be
                            affected unfavorably. For your own information, imminent trade-agreement
                            negotiations with the Dominican Republic might be prejudiced. In the
                            light of the foregoing, you should explain why this Government is unable
                            to concur in the course suggested and at the same time transmit the
                            draft notes and explanatory memorandum enclosed with the Department’s
                            instruction no. 353 of January 12, 1942. The Haitian Government can then
                            decide whether it wishes to proceed with the exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Haiti’s most-favored-nation obligations to other
                            countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, it is made clear to
                            the Haitian Government in the explanatory memorandum referred to that if
                            the tariff reductions accorded to the Dominican Republic are extended to
                            any other country, this Government would expect that they would be
                            extended immediately and unconditionally to the United States.</p>

                            produced during 1942 a threatening situation as regards Haitian economy
                            and in particular government finances, since for past 2 years 68% of
                            government revenues have been derived from import duties.</p>
                        <p>During February reduction in government revenues as compared with 5 year
                            average fell off 188,000 odd dollars. For first 7 days of March total
                            collected government revenues amounted to 45,000 odd dollars as compared
                            with 116,000 for same period last year and estimated 130,000. With total
                            revenue estimate of 5,460,000 for year a fifty percent reduction in
                            import duties signifies a loss of 1,800,000 which cannot be met from
                            other taxes such as government has already or contemplates imposing. The
                            unobligated surplus of 371,000 at the beginning of year has now fallen
                            to 303,000. At the risk of impairing its credit National Bank might
                            advance temporarily 150,000 to 200,000.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Pierson</hi>: Reference is made to
                            conversations between officers of the Department and of the
                            Export-Import Bank with President Lescot of the Republic of Haiti and
                            Mr. Williams, President of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti,
                            regarding the extension of financial assistance to the Government of
                            that Republic through the medium of the National Bank of the Republic of
                            Haiti, in order to alleviate the financial crisis which has arisen
                            primarily as a result of the shortage of shipping facilities.</p>
                        <p>The Department has carefully considered the Haitian financial situation
                            and, due to the uncertainties in regard to the shipping facilities which
                            will be available to Haiti in the coming months, feels strongly that the
                            opening by the Export-Import Bank of a line of credit of $500,000 in
                            favor of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, to be utilized only
                            when necessary to maintain the Haitian economy, would be advisable at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>The Department has received assurances from the President of the Republic
                            of Haiti that expenditures of the Government of Haiti will be kept at a
                            minimum and that new tax legislation will be shortly enacted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Pierson and Mr. Williams discussed the general financial and revenue
                            situation with which the Haitian Government is confronted, in view of
                            present shipping shortages and the resulting diminution of export and
                            import duties on which Haitian revenues are so largely based. Mr.
                            Williams stated that new taxes were contemplated in order to increase
                            the Government’s revenues, but that he felt it imperative to have a
                            reserve fund on which to rely in case of dire <pb n="467"
                                xml:id="pg_467" facs="0481"/>emergency. This emergency fund would
                            not be tapped unless it were found absolutely necessary, and it was Mr.
                            Williams’ hope and desire that no use of the funds would prove to be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion, Mr. Pierson agreed that a commitment, in the
                            amount of $500,000, would be made for two years’ time from the
                            Export-Import Bank to the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti. The
                            commitment could be styled a “Dollar Exchange Credit to the Haitian
                            Central Bank”. The form of the commitment would be a letter from the
                            Export-Import Bank to the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Williams stated that he would make it abundantly clear to President
                            Lescot, as had already been done, namely, that there was to be no
                            increase in the Haitian budget, which would result in a call upon the
                            emergency commitment.</p>

                            by His Excellency Fernand Dennis, Minister of Haiti at Washington,
                            several agreements were reached. These agreements were covered in an

                            Lescot and the Acting Secretary of State, Sumner Welles.</p>
                        <p>The text of the memorandum follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I. There will be an exchange of notes whereby the two
                                    Governments will give their formal approval to a Memorandum of
                                    Understanding signed on March 28, 1942 by the Haitian and United
                                    States Secretaries of Agriculture, regarding the purchase by the
                                    Commodity Credit Corporation of the United States of the surplus
                                    cotton production of Haiti. According to the understanding the
                                    Commodity <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0482"/>Credit
                                    Corporation will take over, at an agreed price, the carry-over
                                    of cotton from last year’s crop as well as all of the surplus of
                                    the crop of 1942. The United States Government agrees to
                                    purchase, subject to an agreed price and within specified
                                    limitations of amount, the 1943 cotton crop and all subsequent
                                    cotton crops produced in Haiti during the present war. The
                                    Haitian Government on its part will take steps to restrict the
                                    production of cotton and to bring about an improvement in
                                    quality and an increase in the staple length of cotton produced
                                    in future years. The United States Department of Agriculture
                                    will be pleased to lend its assistance in the carrying out of
                                    the cotton improvement program.</p>
                                <p>“II. The Export-Import Bank of Washington has extended a line of
                                    credit to the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti in amounts
                                    which may be agreed upon as necessary for the purpose of
                                    strengthening the Haitian gourde-United States dollar exchange
                                    relationship which is peculiarly affected by the influence of
                                    shipping availability on exports and imports into the Republic.
                                    The Government of Haiti has agreed, on its part, to take all
                                    feasible measures to improve its budgetary position.</p>
                                <p>“The two Governments will continue to explore the possibilities
                                    of extending assistance to the Republic of Haiti in handling the
                                    surpluses of its agricultural products.</p>
                                <p>“III. In view of the pledge of the two Governments to employ
                                    their full resources against the common enemy, and the need for
                                    an immediate increase in the production of sisal in order to
                                    prosecute the common war effort, the two Governments agreed in
                                    principle to arrangements providing for the planting of
                                    approximately 24,000 additional acres of sisal in Haiti.</p>
                                <p>“As much land as can be planted within one year’s time from the
                                    present date, up to a maximum of 12,000 acres will be undertaken
                                    through the Societe Haitiano-Americaine de Developpement
                                    Agricole; and as much additional acreage as practicable will be
                                    planted by private interests within one year’s time from today’s
                                    date, up to a maximum of 12,000 acres. The details of the
                                    financial arrangements necessary for the planting of the
                                    additional acreage are to be worked out with the appropriate

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Under Secretary of State</hi>: I am taking
                            advantage of the mission to Washington of our Secretary of State for
                            Finance, Mr. Abel Lacroix, to ask him to give you this letter in order
                            to express to you the satisfaction I feel over the execution of the last
                                Agreement<note n="17" xml:id="d483fn17">Agreements covered in an
                                omnibus memorandum initialed at Washington on April 6, 1942; see
                                Press Release issued by the Department of State, April 13, <ref
                                    target="#pg_467">p. 467</ref>.</note> which I had the happy
                            pleasure of initialing with you, on my last visit to Washington, and for
                            which I shall never cease to assure you of my deep gratitude.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, one point in this Agreement which is causing me some
                            uneasiness as respects its execution and about which I would not have
                            spoken to you, because of your constant and most important concerns, if
                            the very rhythm of our national life was not threatened with suffering a
                            stoppage which would be prejudicial from every point of view in these
                            grave times.</p>
                        <p>It concerns the help with [<hi rend="italic">which</hi>] the Republic of
                            Haiti hopes to obtain from the United States in meeting its budget, 79
                            per cent of which is guaranteed by receipts coming from the collection
                            of fiscal taxes on both imports and exports, since it is faced with the
                            impossibility of carrying on its export and import trade.</p>
                        <p>You will remember that it was agreed that, in the clauses of the
                            Agreement, there was to appear a suitable phrase to express this
                            possible support which we might expect from the American Government. To
                            this end, consideration was given to a possible decrease in the value of
                            our gourde with respect to the American dollar, on account of the
                            unparalleled difficulties experienced by Haiti, because of the war, in
                            connection with its imports and exports, and to the duty of the Haitian
                            Government of using every possible means to assure the carrying out of
                            its budget, either through the creation of new taxes or by making
                            certain economies.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately aided by the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, my
                            Administration has made every possible effort for the moment in <pb
                                n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0485"/>both these directions. In
                            addition, it proposes to apply other measures to these same ends for the
                            new budgetary fiscal year which begins October 1 next.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, it was agreed that the amount of the aid to be granted us by
                            the Government of the United States through the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington would not be specified. A sum of five hundred thousand
                            dollars ($500,000) was suggested by the Director of the Export-Import
                            Bank, but we could not have agreed that such a sum be specified in
                            advance, since we could not know the degree in which the war was going
                            to affect our receipts. As a matter of fact, the amount was not
                            specified in the agreement.</p>
                        <p>To my great astonishment, very shortly after my return from the United
                            States, the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti forwarded to me a
                            communication received from the Export-Import Bank in which it was
                            stated that the sum of $500,000, previously suggested, had been placed
                            at the disposal of the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti with a
                            view to obviating a possible decrease in the fiscal receipts of the
                            Haitian Government—and this on quite unexpected conditions, among which
                            appeared the reduction of our beggarly budget, a budget of less than six
                            million dollars.</p>
                        <p>Knowing the good faith and the responsibility of my Administration,
                            conscious of our rectitude and assured by the word of the Government of
                            the United States, I have not wanted to consider the proposal made to
                            the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti, particularly since: (1) such
                            an agreement was not made—no definite sum having been contemplated since
                            we could not in advance estimate the decrease in our receipts, a
                            decrease proportional to the entry and departure of ships; (2) the
                            reduction of our beggarly budget is a measure with which we have had too
                            much experience in the past and which, at the present moment, would be
                            the surest way of lessening my Administration’s prestige with the
                            Haitian people and, thereby, undermining the efforts of this
                            Administration to guarantee the country’s total collaboration in
                            relations with the United States which ought to be firmer and more
                            unshakeable than ever; (3)the financial situation of the National Bank
                            of the Republic of Haiti is excellent and it is not this institution
                            which requests financial assistance. Since it is the Haitian Government
                            which is faced with the problem of the daily increasing reduction in
                            means of transportation, either for imports or for exports, it is not
                            the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti which should be accorded the
                            credit, but rather the Haitian Government.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, in spite of the sharp difficulties we have with respect to
                            our financial possibilities, we have religiously taken care of the
                            execution of our budget since last October. Only a period of three
                            months remains to be covered to complete the execution of the budget <pb
                                n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0486"/>for the fiscal year which is
                            ending but, because of the impossibility of importing and exporting, we
                            are in doubt as to the receipts for the coming three months.</p>
                        <p>The situation which confronts us may be summed up thus: we would never
                            have needed the financial aid requested if the war had not severely
                            affected our means of transportation. The number of boats coming into
                            our ports has been reduced in a way which is more than alarming. The
                            warehouses are filled with our export goods and exporters have exhausted
                            their reserve funds in the purchase of these unexported goods. And, in
                            addition, the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti has reached the
                            ceiling of advances which it has been possible for it to make to these
                            same exporters.</p>
                        <p>If Haitian ports were only visited by fifty per cent more of the small
                            number of ships which touch at them now, we could, by our own means,
                            meet our obligations. Also, if it is not possible for us to have a few
                            more ships to bring us goods and carry away our commodities which, from
                            day to day, are piling up, we shall have to have financial assistance to
                            guarantee the normal working of our Administration. It would be well,
                            however, to remember that it is solely the impossibility of importing
                            and exporting in a reasonable way which puts us into the present
                            depression.</p>
                        <p>Such then, in broad outline, is the situation in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Welles, it is on you that I again count in aiding us with the
                            competent services, in order that a better fate be arranged for Haiti in
                            the effort which it is making to find a solution for its financial
                            difficulties. We do not lack commodities to export. Our citizens’
                            purchasing powers are growing and will continue to increase, thanks to
                            the work which the United States is helping us to undertake and imported
                            goods could easily be disposed of; but it is the Haitian Government
                            itself which is at its wits’ end to exist, since it is impossible for it
                            to contrive receipts.</p>
                        <p>I have asked Mr. Lacroix to tell you about all these things, among others
                            about the possible financing of the exporters who, on account of
                            difficulties in exporting and storing, will soon no longer be able to
                            purchase the commodities offered.</p>
                        <p>We are in the vacation period. Would it not be possible for you, with
                            Mrs. Welles, to visit Haiti, if only for a few days? Mrs. Lescot and I
                            renew to you and Mrs. Welles the invitation which I had the pleasure of
                            giving you on my last visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>I renew my respectful compliments to Mrs. Welles. Mrs. Lescot asks to be
                            remembered to you.</p>
                        <p>To you, my dear Under Secretary of State and very dear friend, the
                            assurance of my unchangeable and sincere feelings of gratitude.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Under Secretary of State</hi>: With
                            reference to my letter of June 23, which I sent you through our
                            Secretary of State for Finance, Mr. Abel Lacroix, in which I requested
                            of your kindness—which has never failed me—assistance in the solution of
                            the embarrassments in which we are at the present hour because of the
                            impossibility of importing merchandise and exporting our products and of
                            assuring the carrying out of our budget, I take the liberty of troubling
                            you once more in the midst of your high and important occupations of the
                            present time to solicit your help with the “Maritime Commission or with
                            the War Shipping Board.” It occurs to me, in calculating the tonnage
                            which Haiti needs both of imports and exports, that a solution to the
                            grave question of vessels which are lacking to us may, perhaps, be
                            arranged as follows:</p>
                        <p>Instead of endeavoring to obtain for ourselves one or two ships per
                            month—vessels of more than average tonnage and traveling at their own
                            risks and perils,—it would be to our advantage if we could receive at
                            Port-au-Prince a regular visit every two months only of a vessel of
                            about 10,000 tons which the Navy of the United States would be good
                            enough to convoy both coming and going. This vessel, which would unload
                            at Port-au-Prince all the goods intended for the other Ports of the
                            country, could receive each time a full load, for the Haitian Government
                            would make arrangements to have all export products brought to the
                            Capital and to distribute to the other Haitian ports goods destined for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Our request is not an exaggerated one for we would only dispose of an
                            annual tonnage of 60,000 tons and it seems to me that in view of the
                            critical aspects of the situation in which we are struggling this
                            solution might be adopted.</p>
                        <p>I cherish the hope that under the circumstances you will, just as you
                            always do, grant me the fullest help and I express my thanks to you
                            therefor in advance.</p>
                        <p>Receive, my dear Under Secretary of State, the renewed assurances of my
                            invariable sentiments of friendship and gratitude.</p>

                            made available when needed. (2) Sympathetic consideration for an
                            increase in the amount, if and when it proved to be necessary. (3) The

                            Bank of the Republic of Haiti guaranteed by the Haitian Government. (4)
                            Interest to be at the rate of 3.6 per cent. (5) Repayment to be over a
                            period of five years; 10 per cent of the amount to be repaid semi
                            annually and with the right to make prepayment.</p>

                                n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0489"/>Minister Lacroix said that he
                            had received a message from President Lescot and that the agreement
                            which had been tentatively offered on July 10 was acceptable to
                            President Lescot. Minister Lacroix also said that it was satisfactory to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson stated that either a letter or a short simple contract would
                            be prepared setting forth the arrangement. It was hoped that this
                            document would be ready to hand Mr. Lacroix before he left Washington.
                            Mr. Pierson inquired as to when it was thought that any funds under this
                            credit would be needed. Mr. Lacroix replied that he thought that it
                            might be soon, although he hoped not and he could not tell in what
                            amounts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arey said that he would supply the Department with a copy of whatever
                            document was submitted to Minister Lacroix.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I refer to your letters
                            of June 23 and July 1, the first of which I had the pleasure of
                            receiving from the hands of your distinguished Secretary of State for
                            Finance, Mr. Abel Lacroix, through whose kindness I am sending you this
                            reply. It has been a privilege to discuss with Mr. Lacroix the different
                            problems brought up in your letters. The detailed report which he will
                            bring you will, I am confident, demonstrate to you again the complete
                            accord which prevails between our two Governments regarding the measures
                            which they can jointly take to meet the critical situation with which
                            they are confronted.</p>
                        <p>The revised proposal of the Export-Import Bank for financial cooperation
                            with the Government of Haiti and with the National Bank is the result of
                            a careful study of all the information available regarding Haitian
                            revenues and expenditures both past and future. It is obviously
                            impossible, under present circumstances to forecast the exact future
                            course of the imports upon which Haitian revenues so largely depend. The
                            situation is one calling for close and frequent consultation between the
                            officials directly concerned.</p>
                        <p>These consultations together with the demonstrated correctness and sense
                            of responsibility of your Government in budgetary matters justify the
                            conviction that such problems as may arise in the future will be
                            satisfactorily and promptly solved.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible at this time to give you any positive statement
                            regarding the shipping situation. It is most serious; we have all
                            suffered grievous losses. Yet our shipbuilding program is progressing by
                            giant steps and our available means of defense and offense <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0490"/>against the submarine menace are being
                            strengthened and multiplied daily. Further hardships and losses await
                            us. Our certain victory depends upon our manner of meeting and enduring
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The suggestions regarding convoys which you made in your letter of July 1
                            are being given careful consideration by the appropriate authorities.
                            This Government is doing its utmost, consistent with the overall
                            requirements of general strategy, to relieve the shipping situation in
                            the Caribbean area. Mr. Lacroix has discussed this problem with the
                            appropriate officials.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to take advantage of this opportunity to tell you how greatly
                            we appreciate the energetic solicitude with which you have personally
                            directed the assistance given to survivors of vessels lost near the
                            Haitian coasts. I can only say that these acts are characteristic of
                            your generosity and of your unfailing interest in the welfare of my
                            compatriots and of all those who are dailing [<hi rend="italic"
                                >daily</hi>] risking their lives to win the battle of supply.</p>
                        <p>I was distressed to learn of the loss at sea of your personal effects, as
                            a result of enemy action, following your recent trip to Washington.</p>
                        <p>The invitation to visit you in Haiti, which you and Madame Lescot have so
                            kindly renewed, is appreciated very much by Mrs. Welles and myself.
                            Although it does not appear possible for us to be absent from Washington
                            for any period of time in the foreseeable future, we are very grateful
                            for the invitation, and Mrs. Welles joins me in sending to you and to
                            Madame Lescot our cordial greetings.</p>
                        <p>Believe me,</p>

                            conversations, we wish to inform you that this Bank is prepared to
                            establish a line of credit of $500,000 available to the Republic of
                            Haiti through the facilities of the Banque Nationale de la Republique
                            d’Haiti to assist the Republic of Haiti in the stabilization of its

                            to its economy. The granting of this credit is premised on the
                            understanding that the present budget of your Government will not be
                            increased while this credit remains available and that advances will be

                        <p>Each advance under the credit will be evidenced by the promissory note of

                            will be payable within five years from the date thereof in ten
                            approximately equal semiannual installments.</p>
                        <p>The credit will be available until September 30, 1943 but it is
                            understood that the unused portion thereof will be subject to

                        <p>74. Rubber Reserve Company is prepared to enter into commitment with
                            Honduran Government to purchase entire production of rubber in Honduras
                            except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon) necessary for
                            domestic consumption, at price of 35 cents per pound c. &amp; f. United
                            States Continental port for usual good quality Castilloa rubber as
                            understood in New York, with appropriate differentials for other grades.
                            The term of the agreement would be for 5 years, price being subject to
                            adjustment after 2 years by mutual agreement if conditions change. The
                            Government of Honduras would agree to restrict export licenses to Rubber
                            Reserve Company or its nominees. The exportation of manufactured rubber,
                            if any, would be restricted to the United States. Honduras would agree
                            to use its best efforts to cause maximum amount of rubber to be produced
                            and made available for sale to Reserve. Local labor would be financed
                            locally for necessities for collecting rubber. Some Honduran
                            governmental agency might be designated as the single buying agency
                            under the contract, if this seemed best way of securing results;
                            otherwise sales would be made through usual trade channels now in
                            existence. Price on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as local
                            sales price.</p>

                            being subject to adjustment after 2 years by mutual agreement if
                            conditions change. The Government of Mexico would agree to restrict
                            export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees. The
                            exportation of manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the

                            Reserve. Local labor would be financed locally for necessities for

                        <p>661. The Department with other interested agencies has been discussing
                            with Undersecretary Beteta the possibility of a contract between the two
                            governments whereby Rubber Reserve Company would acquire, over a 5-year
                            period, all crude rubber, including guayule, produced in Mexico and not
                            required for essential uses in Mexico. It has been estimated here that
                            Mexico’s potential annual production of guayule is not less than 10,000
                            tons, and of castilloa not less than 2,000 tons, and that Mexico’s
                            annual normal consumption is only approximately 5,000 tons of crude
                            rubber.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested to Beteta that in any such contract Mexico agree to
                            limit its consumption to a specified amount required for essential needs
                            and his Government should consider the institution of a conservation
                            program similar to ours, in view of the fact that in any event Mexico’s
                            stockpile will not last indefinitely. Agreements of this type have been
                            negotiated with Brazil and Peru. Beteta advises that his Government
                            feels this is politically impossible. He left yesterday for Mexico City
                            to consult with his Government on this problem.</p>
                        <p>It has seemed to the Department desirable to have in Mexico City during
                            Beteta’s visit someone who is familiar with the latest developments here
                            in the program for the acquisition of rubber in Latin America. Paul
                            Hayes, Chief of the rubber branch of the Board of Economic Warfare, is
                            accordingly leaving tonight by plane for Mexico City to be available for
                            discussion with Beteta and the other Mexican officials. He is fully
                            informed on the rubber program. He will work through and under the
                            supervision of the Embassy. You <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0499"
                            />should do everything possible to facilitate his efforts and work out
                            with him all possible means of forwarding these negotiations. No
                            specific plans have been made, but you and he can decide what is the
                            best method of procedure. He has been authorized by Rubber Reserve to
                            negotiate with respect to the terms of the contract if that seems
                            appropriate during his stay, subject to its approval before any
                            commitment is made with the Mexican Government.</p>

                                agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d494fn3">The agreement was signed

                            extensive publicity to these agreements because of fear of exaggerating
                            in the public mind the amounts of rubber which may be expected from the
                            various American producing countries. It is recognized that you may wish
                            to give additional publicity in Mexico to the various terms of the
                            agreement, and if so we have no objection. Please advise when
                            announcement may be released.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Mr. Hawkins, the above-mentioned officers of the
                            Mexican Embassy called at the Division of Commercial Policy and
                            Agreements at 3 p.m. on December 24, 1941 for the purpose of receiving a
                            list of products for consideration in preparing the list to be published
                            at the time of formal announcement of intention to negotiate a trade
                            agreement with Mexico. The proposal to hand the Mexicans such a list had
                            been approved by Mr. Duggan<note n="9" xml:id="d496fn9">Laurence Duggan,
                                Adviser on Political Relations.</note> the previous week and
                            confirmed on the morning of the twenty-fourth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins first explained that the procedure in negotiating a trade
                            agreement required the formulation of a list of products on which the
                            United States will consider granting concessions, such list to be
                            published in connection with our formal notice. Articles not on the list
                            could not be considered for concessions.</p>
                        <p>The Mexicans stated that they had no analogous procedure with respect to
                            articles upon which Mexico might grant concessions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins stated that the list must be regarded as confidential until
                            formal announcement had been made to the public. The Mexicans stated
                            that they would be glad to arrange for simultaneous press releases at
                            the time of announcement.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. Hawkins’ inquiry as to where the Mexicans would prefer
                            that the negotiations would be held, the Mexicans stated that Licenciado
                            Primo Villa Michel, formerly Minister of Industry <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0504"/>and Minister to London and Japan, would
                            arrive in Washington for the purpose of carrying on these
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>After the Mexicans had examined the list, Mr. Hawkins stated that in all
                            probability a proclamation would shortly be issued allocating the
                            petroleum quota on the same basis as last year, but with the provision
                            that such allocations were to continue through the calendar year 1942
                            unless modified by a subsequent proclamation. This leaves the way open
                            for any action which may be decided upon in the course of the
                            negotiations with Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican officials noted that copper was not on the list and,
                            accordingly, Mr. Hawkins explained the general rule that concessions
                            were made to the other country on articles of which it is the primary or
                            a leading supplier. He indicated that Mexico would get the benefit of
                            any reduction in duty which might be made in future trade agreements
                            with Chile and Peru, which are more important suppliers of this
                            commodity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins handed the Mexicans two copies of the latest standard general

                        <p>I telephoned Señor Sierra to inform him that we hoped to be able to place
                            in his hands by March 31 or April 1, the list of the items which we were
                            prepared to publish with our public announcement of intention to
                            negotiate with Mexico. If no further problems arose regarding the items
                            comprising the list, we believed it would be possible to issue the
                            public announcement on April 3, or at least prior to the departure from
                            Washington of Foreign Minister Padilla. I also told Señor Sierra that we
                            now had ready for him a tentative list of the Schedule I items<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d497fn11">Not printed.</note> on which this
                            Government proposed to request concessions of Mexico, and indicated that
                            this list was, of course, subject to later modification in the light of
                            information received from interested persons in this country.</p>
                        <p>I inquired of Señor Sierra whether his Government intended to publish a
                            list of possible Schedule I items in the same way that Schedule II items
                            were published in this country. He said that he was not sure, but as he
                            would be telephoning Mexico City in the next <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491"
                                facs="0505"/>few minutes, he would make it a point to inquire. Señor
                            Sierra inquired whether this Government would have any objection to the
                            publication by the Mexican Government of a list in Mexico. I told him
                            that this was a matter for the Mexican Government to decide, that we
                            would neither express any objection if the Mexican Government desired to
                            publish such a list nor would we request or encourage the Mexican
                            Government to do so.</p>
                        <p>Señor Sierra promised to call later in the day to receive the tentative
                            Schedule I list and said that he would transmit this to his Government
                            tonight.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p>In accordance with the above, Señor Sierra called and was given the
                                Schedule I tentative list. He said that as a result of his telephone
                                call to Mexico City he was of the opinion that his Government would
                                not publish a Schedule I list.</p>

                        <p>Señor Sierra called by request to receive the list of additional proucts
                            which we were prepared to include in the list accompanying the public
                            notice of intention to negotiate with Mexico. I handed Señor Sierra a
                            copy of the list of additional items, explaining at the same time that
                            while the original had not yet been initialed in the Department, I
                            wished to get a copy of the list into his hands on an informal basis as
                            quickly as possible in order that the Mexican Ambassador<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d498fn12">Francisco Castillo Nájera.</note> might determine
                            whether the list of additional items, plus the original list handed to
                            the Mexican Embassy in December 1941, was satisfactory to the Mexican
                            Government for publication. I told Señor Sierra that I would send the
                            original of the list to him as soon as it had been initialed.</p>
                        <p>I went over the list with Señor Sierra pointing out that it had not been
                            possible in all cases to accede to the request of the Mexican Government
                            for inclusion of certain items in the list, but we had gone as far as
                            possible in this direction. At the same time we had included a number of
                            items, not specifically requested by Mexico, in which we had found that
                            imports from Mexico were of growing importance, and if the Mexican
                            Government were interested in these items we would be willing to include
                            them in the published list. I indicated to Señor Sierra, at the same
                            time, that in the case of a number of these products included upon our
                            initiative, in view of the fact that Mexico had become the major or an
                            important supplier <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0506"/>only because
                            normal sources were cut off by the war, it might be necessary, if it
                            were found that concessions could be granted on such items, to include
                            them in the agreement on a basis whereby the United States would have
                            the right, six months or some such period after the war, to withdraw the
                            concessions from the agreement. I mentioned that this had been done in
                            the case of the recent trade agreement with Argentina.<note n="13"

                        </p>
                        <p>Señor Sierra was informed, regarding the original list of products handed
                            to the Mexican Embassy in December 1941, that we had found it desirable
                            to withdraw two of the items included therein, Paragraph 1719 covering
                            unspecified crude minerals and Paragraphs 1785 and 1786, covering tin.
                            In both these cases we had felt that the present or potential position
                            of Mexico as a supplier did not warrant inclusion of the items. I also
                            indicated to Señor Sierra that we had made certain changes in language
                            in a number of the other items in the original list, but these changes
                            did not lessen the scope of the items.</p>
                        <p>Señor Sierra seemed personally satisfied with our proposals and said that
                            he would get them into the hands of the Ambassador as soon as possible
                            and would try to get confirmation to me this afternoon in order that we
                            could proceed with the steps leading up to the issuance of the public
                            notice here and announcement to the press simultaneously in Mexico City.
                            It was tentatively agreed that we would try to have the announcements
                            issued tomorrow morning around 11 or 12 o’clock, approximately the time
                            of the departure for New York of the Mexican Foreign Minister.</p>

                            <p>Señor Sierra telephoned at 4 p.m. and stated that the supplementary

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: On instructions from my
                            Government, I have the honor to refer both to the memorandum presented
                            by the Department under Your Excellency’s worthy charge on May 21 [<hi
                                rend="italic">20?</hi>], 1942,<note n="15" xml:id="d501fn15">Not
                                printed.</note> and to the draft of bases for a trade agreement,
                            prepared by the said Department and dated May 26, 1942 which, through my
                            intermediary, Your Excellency’s Government submitted for the
                            consideration of the Government of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum which I have the pleasure of sending to Your Excellency
                            with this note, there are set forth the general points of view which the
                            Government of Mexico feels should inspire the negotiations for a trade
                            agreement between our two countries. In addition, amendments, additions
                            or substitutions are proposed for articles in the draft drawn up by the
                            Department of State, the reasons being given which, in the opinion of
                            the Mexican Government, justify the advisability of the changes
                            suggested. Lastly, the memorandum contains certain new articles which my
                            Government considers it indispensable to include in the definitive text
                            of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>I have the pleasure of informing Your Excellency that my Government is
                            animated by the greatest willingness to make, in the course of the
                            negotiations, all such concessions as are compatible with its
                            possibilities, without further limitations than those inescapably
                            imposed by its economy; nevertheless, my Government wishes to invite
                            Your Excellency’s attention to the principal concession which my own
                            Government is disposed to offer and which consists in undertaking not to
                            raise its tariffs with respect to a great many products, a circumstance
                            which, of itself, means a great advantage for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I am pleased to inform Your Excellency that the technical
                            delegation appointed by the Mexican Government is now in the city of
                            Washington; accordingly, this Embassy feels that it is an easy matter to
                            hasten the negotiations, beginning the final conversations at the
                            earliest date convenient for Your Excellency’s Government.</p>

                            <p>With respect to the fundamental points of view concerning commercial
                                and tariff policy which the trade agreement between Mexico and the
                                United States should determine for the two countries, the Government
                                of Mexico has special interest in having the Government of the
                                United States give attention to the general considerations which are
                                herein briefly set forth and which, in the course of the
                                negotiations, may be enlarged upon to the necessary degree.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico feels that, in order for the agreement which
                                is to be negotiated to be founded on a basis of real, just and
                                equitable reciprocity, account will have to be taken of the
                                necessity of substantial tariff concessions being granted by the
                                United States, in general, even though, in some cases, Mexico may
                                find it impossible to modify its tariff rates now in force, or else
                                can only decrease them on a very slight scale.</p>
                            <p>Any concession which Mexico may make in this respect, however little
                                it may appear, certainly means a sacrifice greater than a similar
                                reduction in its tariff rates can mean for the United States of
                                America. In fact, Mexico is in a disadvantageous position with
                                respect to the United States as regards the tariff situation. A
                                number of reasons may be invoked to justify the above assertion;
                                and, among others, the following comments may be made herewith:</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The so-called “Underwood Tariff”, approved
                                in 1913,<note n="16" xml:id="d501fn16">38 Stat. 114.</note> set
                                import duties which were far too high—even though it could be called
                                liberal by comparison with the excessive protectionism of the 1897
                                    tariff,<note n="17" xml:id="d501fn17">30 Stat. 151.</note> which
                                established quotas which were relatively as high as in the tariff of
                                    1864,<note n="18" xml:id="d501fn18">13 Stat. 202.</note> famous
                                for its high tariff level. After the last World War, the said level
                                was raised on various occasions and, in 1922, a new tariff<note

                                the United States which had even more protectionist tendencies.
                                Finally, in 1930, the Hawley-Smoot tariff,<note n="20"
                                    xml:id="d501fn20">46 Stat. 590.</note> in effect at present, set
                                the highest import duties in all American history.</p>
                            <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0513"/>
                            <p>Accordingly, the American tariff which will serve as a point of
                                departure in the negotiations for the agreement is a tariff, without
                                precedent, as respects its height, in the history of the United
                                States and, possibly, without equal in the rest of the world, while
                                the tariff in force in Mexico can be termed one of the lowest in
                                existence.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Almost all Mexican duties on imports are
                                    <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> duties and, accordingly, are
                                constant and independent of the prices of the products; while those
                                in the United States are, in the great majority, ad-valorem, the
                                result of which is that they fluctuate along with the price of the
                                products.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence, as the value of Mexican currency has been
                                decreasing in relation to the dollar, that is, in proportion as
                                prices, in pesos, of American articles imported by Mexico have gone
                                up—which has happened to a marked degree since 1932—<hi
                                    rend="italic">Mexican tariffs have amounted to an actual,
                                    increasingly smaller charge</hi> against American products
                                imported by Mexico, and the disparity between them and the
                                corresponding duties in the United states has been becoming
                                continually sharper.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the low level of the Mexican peso (which is due to
                                reasons which it is not necessary to explain here) is far from
                                having decreased Mexico’s capacity to import American goods. On the
                                contrary, such imports have considerably increased, as is shown by
                                statistics for the years 1932 to 1941 (Appendix 1).<note n="21"

                                <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Mexico does not seek autarchy nor does it
                                try, on any grounds, to do without articles from the United States.
                                However, being a country whose industrial development is barely
                                starting, the majority of its incipient industries unavoidably
                                require protection against the competition of foreign industries
                                which are already full grown, and which operate on a large scale,
                                with low costs of production. The Mexican Government has decided to
                                limit this protection to those industrial activities which, in
                                accordance with the means and resources of the country, may be
                                useful in assuring the stability of its economic future, and is not
                                trying artificially to stimulate, with tariff measures, the
                                establishment of exotic industries, lacking a basis of real economic
                                support.</p>

                                States obtain approximately equal amounts, in absolute figures, from
                                duties on the commercial movement between the two countries, as may
                                be seen by the statistical table attached (Appendix 2);<note n="21"
                                    xml:id="d501fn22">Not printed.</note> however, the amount of
                                such sums is equivalent, in Mexico, <hi rend="italic">to more than
                                    one-fourth of the total collections</hi> (27.1% in 1940), while,
                                in the United States, it represents only 0.5 per cent of the Federal
                                receipts in the same year, 1940.</p>

                                possibilities, the Government of Mexico is assisting in continental
                                defense, a circumstance which will necessarily have the effect of
                                increasing its expenditures for military purposes and projects of a
                                strategic character. This is one additional reason why Mexico cannot
                                dispense to a substantial degree with the receipts coming from its
                                tariffs.</p>

                                Mexico the obligation of paying the Government of the United States
                                very large amounts, the payment of which will be made in
                                installments which will mean a positive sacrifice for the Mexican
                                treasury. In addition, the balance of payments will be still more
                                unfavorable for Mexico at the time when it has to pay the principal
                                and interest on the new American investments. Mexico will only be
                                able to export the necessary amount of foreign exchange if it sells
                                an equal amount of goods or services to the United States.
                                Accordingly, it is considered necessary for the Government of the
                                United States to take Mexico’s situation as a debtor country into
                                consideration so as to grant it special tariff concessions, which
                                will surely be greater than those which it has granted to other
                                countries with which it has concluded trade agreements in recent
                                years.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico considers that the facts and arguments set
                                forth in the above paragraphs satisfactorily prove that, in order
                                for there to be true reciprocity in the trade agreement between
                                Mexico and the United States, it is necessary for the greater part
                                of the tariff reductions established to be granted by the United
                                States.</p>

                            <p>The Mexican Government has studied with great care the concrete
                                proposals submitted to it by the Government of the United States in
                                the documents to which reference was made at the beginning of this
                                memorandum. With respect to them, it is necessary to point out
                                forthwith that Mexico holds that the forthcoming trade agreement
                                should permanently strengthen the economic relations between the two
                                countries; therefore, the Mexican Government would like to have the
                                agreement be in effect for the longest possible time and not have as
                                its limit, not even in the case of certain concessions, the
                                termination of the present conflict. To this it must be added that,
                                in any event, Articles X and XI of the proposed agreement presented
                                by the Government of the United States empower either of the two
                                countries to withdraw the concessions established, in whole or in
                                part, in case they involve an injury to the interests of either of
                                the contracting parties.</p>

                                that it is confident that a formula will be found which will satisfy
                                the interests of both countries.</p>
                            <p rend="center">IV</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico considers it pertinent to make certain
                                proposals concerning some of the articles which constitute the draft
                                trade agreement submitted to its Embassy in Washington by the
                                Department of State. At the same time, it begs to propose the
                                acceptance of certain additional articles which the Government of
                                Mexico considers it necessary to include in the aforesaid agreement.
                                The Government of Mexico does not doubt that they will meet with the
                                approval of the Government of the United States since it feels that
                                the stipulations thereof are in harmony with the general spirit
                                which animates the proposals of the American Government and in view
                                of the fact that some of the said articles have been adopted in
                                similar agreements signed by the United States with other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>A. Concerning the draft agreement proposed by the Government of the
                                United States, the Government of Mexico considers that the preamble
                                and articles I, II, IV, V, VIII, IX, XIV and XVI can be accepted
                                without change, in the form in which they were drawn up by the
                                Department of State.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Article II [<hi rend="italic">III</hi>] of the
                                above-mentioned draft, the Mexican Government has no objection to
                                accepting the first paragraph thereof. But with regard to paragraph
                                2, it believes that the wording should be changed to read as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“If the Government of the United States of America or the

                                        exportation of any article, or on the sale, distribution or
                                        use of any article imported, public knowledge shall be given
                                        of the total amount or the total value of the said article
                                        which it shall be permitted to import, export, sell,
                                        distribute or use during the period specified, as well as of
                                        any change in the said amount or value. Furthermore, if the

                                        of the United Mexican States allots a proportion of that
                                        amount or value to any third county it shall allot to the
                                        other country, with respect to any article in which it has
                                        an important interest, a share based on the proportion of

                                        which can be considered as typical. In the case of quotas on

                                which they were presented, but that the wording of paragraph 5

                            <p>With respect to Article XIII, the Government of Mexico accepts the
                                first paragraph but it thinks that the second paragraph should be

                            <p>After studying the schedule of Mexican articles proposed by the
                                Department of State, the Government of Mexico believes that those
                                specified in Appendix 3<note n="26" xml:id="d501fn26">Not
                                    printed.</note> of this Memorandum should be excluded, since it
                                must reserve the liberty of changing the tariffs thereon, with a
                                view to the needs of the national industry.</p>

                            <p>The Government of Mexico wishes to point out that, in examining the
                                schedule of American articles which was submitted to it by the
                                Department of State, it has interpreted the numbers of the items
                                included thereon as being those which must be taken into
                                consideration for the negotiations and that, in cases where the
                                wording of the item on the schedule does not concur with wording of
                                the official tariff, it is to be understood that the negotiations
                                will embrace the whole item and not only part thereof.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the Government of Mexico would like to have accepted an
                                elastic interpretation of some items, which list certain articles in
                                a limited way, in order that it might be able to include within them
                                other similar articles which are not expressly mentioned in the said
                                items.</p>

                            <p>Mexico desires an increase in the quota at present in force for the
                                importation into the United States of certain products which have a
                                preponderant place in Mexico’s economy and which will be discussed
                                in detail in the course of the negotiations. Among such products <pb
                                    n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0518"/>is, first of all, oil,—of
                                which at present the United States imports from Mexico, on a low
                                quota, only the amount of 3,592,103 barrels. The said amount is
                                included in the very low allotment of 3.8 percent of the 5 percent
                                of American consumption which is the quota allotted to
                                “miscellaneous countries.”</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico considers that both the huge increase in
                                consumption of fuels resulting from the war and the prime necessity
                                therefor which the United States now has, for the application of its
                                policy of defense of the Continent and the Democracies, as well as
                                the radical changes which have recently occurred in the distribution
                                of the oil-producing territories of the world justify and demand,
                                indeed to the advantage of the United States itself, a considerable
                                increase in the quota at present in force. Mexico would,
                                accordingly, like the said quota to be enlarged so as to admit the
                                amount of 31,000,000 barrels, which is the amount which it can
                                annually furnish the United States of America.</p>

                        <p>Following the formal opening session of the negotiations for the trade
                            agreement with Mexico on July 17, the above-named members of the Mexican
                            Delegation called to begin discussions of the general provisions. The
                            Mexican Embassy, under date of July 6, had transmitted its first
                            counterproposals on the general provisions and these served as the basis
                            for the discussions.</p>
                        <p>As pointed out in the Mexican note, the Mexican Government accepted
                            without change the preamble and Articles I and II of the draft general
                            provisions submitted by the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>On Article III, on quotas in general, the Mexican Government had
                            submitted a redraft of that part of the Article referring to the period
                            which should be selected as that upon which quotas should be based. The
                            Mexican draft made the specific points that the period should not be one
                            year; it should be a previous representative five-year period or some
                            other previous representative period on which the two countries might
                            agree; and that quotas in effect on the day of signature of the
                            agreement should be modified to conform with the principle advanced by
                            the Mexican Government regarding a representative period. It was pointed
                            out by the Mexican negotiators that Mexico had come late into the
                            trade-agreements picture and for that reason Mexico should not be
                            adversely affected by the share of quotas allotted to that country which
                            resulted from negotiations with third countries. It was agreed that any
                            final decision which might be reached on the matter of quotas would be
                            affected to a considerable extent by the concessions which the United
                            States Government would offer on such products as petroleum and cattle
                            and therefore it would be better to leave this Article open for further
                            discussion after the Mexican negotiators had seen our definitive
                            Schedule II offers. It could then be determined whether or not the
                            Mexican Government wished to continue to seek the adoption of the
                            proposals set forth in the note of July 6. With regard to the final
                            phrase of the third paragraph of Article III, the Mexican negotiators
                            inquired whether it would not be possible to find somewhat more precise
                            language to cover customs quotas. They were informed that we would look
                            into the possibility of drafting new and more specific language.</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0520"/>
                        <p>Article IV of the draft general provisions as presented by the United
                            States on exchange control was acceptable to the Mexican Government
                            without change.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Article V on monopolies and government purchases, the
                            Mexican Government wished to have the word “transportation” included
                            among the considerations such as price, quality, marketability and terms
                            of sale which would be taken into account by government purchasing
                            agencies. The Mexican negotiators were assured that this proposal would
                            receive our sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Article VI on customs administrative matters, advances in
                            duties, customs penalties, consultation on technical matters and
                            Committee of Sanitary Experts, the Mexican Government was in accord with
                            the first four points, but on the fifth desired a change which would
                            result in the sanitary experts (an equal number representing each
                            government) reaching a decision and not merely a recommendation, as set
                            forth in the United States draft. Further, the Mexican negotiators
                            desired that an arbitrator be appointed in case of disagreement by the
                            technical experts representing each government in order that a final
                            decision might be reached, binding on both governments. The Mexican
                            negotiators were given an explanation of the restrictions encountered by
                            the laws and regulations of the United States Government affecting
                            sanitary matters. Reference was made to the case which arose several
                            years ago in connection with the operation of the trade agreement with
                            the Netherlands, under which progress was made in working out a solution
                            of a difficult sanitary question concerning the importation of tulip
                            bulbs from the Netherlands. The Mexican negotiators agreed that there
                            was some value in the procedure provided for by our proposal but they
                            desired to strengthen it so that a mere recommendation by
                            representatives of the two governments on sanitary matters would not
                            merely be pigeonholed and no action result. The Mexican negotiators were
                            informed that we probably could not agree to their request due to the
                            legal restrictions in this country, but we would of course submit their
                            proposal for further consideration.</p>
                        <p>Articles VII and VIII, on duty concessions by the two countries, and
                            Article IX, on compensating taxes, were accepted by the Mexican
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican negotiators raised no question concerning the provisions of
                            Article X, quotas on scheduled products, except that at the end of the
                            third paragraph they requested that some such phrase as “to which both
                            countries are signatory” should be added.</p>
                        <p>Article XI, covering withdrawal or modification of concessions, was also
                            acceptable to the Mexican Government without change, and they promised
                            in the near future to submit a draft of those provisions, <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0521"/>omitted from the text as submitted by
                            the United States, which would provide for the application of the
                            Article to imports into Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican negotiators expressed the desire to eliminate Article XII,
                            the general provision to safeguard concessions. The second sentence of
                            the Article, providing for termination of the agreement, was
                            particularly difficult for the Mexicans to accept. They pointed out that
                            the inclusion of the Article as drafted would be interpreted in Mexico
                            as a swinging of the big stick by the United States and an ability to
                            interfere in Mexican affairs not related to the trade agreement. The
                            negotiators agreed to consult with their Government as to the
                            possibility of leaving in the first sentence of the Article but
                            eliminating the second providing for termination.</p>
                        <p>On Article XIII, the matter of territorial application of the provisions
                            of the agreement, the Mexican negotiators expressed the desire that this
                            be discussed directly with Lie. Beteta. They did not know the reason why
                            the Mexican Government was opposed to the inclusion in this Article of
                            any reference to the Panama Canal Zone and stated that it was their
                            confidential understanding that the Mexican Government, while it did not
                            agree to inclusion of reference to the Panama Canal Zone in the
                            agreement proper, would consent to such a reference in a separate (and
                            presumably unpublished) exchange of notes. The negotiators said that
                            there were matters of high policy involved here which they as technical
                            experts were not qualified to discuss.</p>
                        <p>Article XIV, on exceptions to most-favored-nation treatment, was
                            acceptable to the Mexican Government without change.</p>
                        <p>On Article XV on general reservations, the Mexican Government desired
                            that the provisions of the final paragraph relating to Constitutional
                            limitations on the authority of the Federal Government be made
                            reciprocal.</p>
                        <p>The final Article, XVI, providing for proclamation, ratification,
                            definitive entry into force, duration and termination of the agreement,
                            was satisfactory to the Mexican Government as proposed by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The question then arose of two articles which the Mexican Government
                            desired to add to those proposed by the United States: (1) on sanitary
                            requirements, providing that each government would do everything in its
                            power to facilitate shipments in transit in either country destined for
                            third countries; and (2) relating to the application of ad valorem rates
                            of duty and methods of converting currencies.</p>
                        <p>On the first point the Mexican negotiators referred to cases, involving
                            oranges particularly, where on shipments from Mexico to Canada, after
                            fumigation at the United States–Mexican border and sealing of the
                            freight car under customs supervision, transit through certain
                            individual states in this country was refused. The Mexican negotiators
                            were informed that this was the first time that any such <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0522"/>case had been brought to our attention
                            and that we would look into the matter. In the meantime the Mexican
                            negotiators were requested to supply a memorandum providing details on
                            the specific cases to which reference had been made.</p>
                        <p>On the second point the Mexican negotiators were given a brief outline of
                            the difficulties in this country growing out of the application of laws
                            which did not take into account such factors as multiple rates of
                            exchange in foreign currencies. The Mexican negotiators were told that
                            while we probably could not agree to the proposal which they had made,
                            which was to use the language of the trade agreement with Costa
                                Rica<note n="27" xml:id="d503fn27">For text of agreement signed

                            possibly we would be in a position to submit to them language in more

                        <p>It was agreed that the next meeting would be held as soon as the

                        <p>Dr. Beteta called on his own initiative in connection with the
                            trade-agreement negotiations. He said he is now authorized to accept our
                            reservation regarding the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>He also referred to the sanitary clause and stated the reasons for
                            proposing that disputes on sanitary matters be made in effect a matter
                            for arbitration, the reasons for this proposal being the belief that
                            sanitary restrictions may sometimes be imposed for other motives. I
                            outlined at some length the objections to the proposal, and he said that
                            he would take up with his Government the question of accepting our draft
                            as submitted.</p>
                        <p>He next referred to the transit clause which the Mexican Government had
                            proposed and mentioned the sanitary aspects of this matter. I told him
                            that any sanitary measure, whether or not in connection with transit,
                            would presumably be covered by the provision referred to above; and that
                            we would look into the feasibility of including the clause from the
                            purely transit standpoint.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Schedule I, Dr. Beteta said that Mexico could not make
                            concessions on agricultural products. I explained to him <pb n="509"
                                xml:id="pg_509" facs="0523"/>why such concessions are essential from
                            our standpoint, and he seemed to understand the reasons stated. In this
                            connection, he referred to our request for a concession on apples and
                            asked whether we could not consider putting the concession on a seasonal
                            basis as such a limitation would help him defend the concession in
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Schedule II, Dr. Beteta asked that Mexico be given the
                            full 50 percent reduction in duty on tomatoes and that the season during
                            which the concession applies be extended to two months. I explained to
                            him how a further reduction of duty would result in a further reduction
                            to Cuba and the reasons why this is objectionable, which reasons he
                            seemed fully to understand.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the extension of the season, I said that I did not know the
                            situation but that our people were presumably looking into the matter if
                            the question had been raised with them, which he said it had.</p>
                        <p>With reference to petroleum, Dr. Beteta asked how soon we could get a
                            decision, what concession we were seeking to get Interior to agree to,
                            and whether we were trying to get the quota removed entirely. I said it
                            is a little difficult to give a precise answer to this question, but I
                            could assure him that we would get the best concession possible. With
                            reference to the time, I said that I could not tell him definitely but
                            that I hoped we would be in a position to tell him within a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Beteta said it is difficult to talk about concessions which they will
                            grant, or to urge his Government to accept our proposals, without
                            knowing what we were prepared to offer on so important an item as
                            petroleum. I suggested that if it is impossible to go ahead with
                            important matters of substance, that our two delegations might clear
                            away technical details, such as translations and so forth, pending a
                            continuation of the discussions on important questions of substance. He
                            agreed that this is desirable.</p>

                        <p>The Mexicans raised no objection to the inclusion in Article I, relating
                            to most-favored-nation treatment, of language extending such treatment
                            to laws and regulations affecting the distribution as well as the
                            taxation, sale and use of imported articles. Likewise, they suggested no
                            change in the language of paragraph 1, Article V, incorporating their
                            proposal that the provisions of this paragraph refer to “exclusive
                            agencies” rather than monopolies. They thought there would be no
                            objection to extending the provisions of this paragraph to exclusive
                            agencies for export as well as import and were told that language would
                            be drawn up accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The Mexicans had no objection to offer to the proposed second paragraph
                            of Article VIII reserving to the United States the right to withdraw or
                            modify Schedule III concessions at any time after the termination of the
                            unlimited national emergency proclaimed by the President of the United

                            inquired, however, whether this paragraph would not be a suitable place
                            for including provisions which would bind on a permanent basis existing
                            rates on Schedule III products. He was told that this proposal, which
                            had been advanced by the Mexicans in discussions relating to the
                            schedules of concessions, had not yet been fully considered by the
                            trade-agreements organization but that if accepted suitable language
                            could of course be found.</p>
                        <p>With regard to paragraph 1 of Article X, relating to quotas on scheduled
                            products, it was explained that the words “subject to the provisions of
                            the second paragraph of this Article and to the provisions of Article
                            XI,” had been omitted from this paragraph because they seemed to imply
                            that the provisions of the paragraph were not subject to other
                            provisions of the agreement, e.g. the exception in Article XV in regard
                            to sanitary regulations, and because the intent of this paragraph and of
                            the second paragraph of the Article (outlining the circumstances under
                            which quotas may be imposed) were clear without them.</p>
                        <p>In proposing language which would make reciprocal the second paragraph of
                            Article XV (reservation in regard to constitutional limitations on
                            federal authority) to which the Mexicans raised no objection, it was
                            suggested to the Mexican negotiators that it might be desirable, since
                            it was implicit that each government would be limited by its
                            constitution, to drop this paragraph entirely; in lieu thereof an
                            explanatory memorandum would be handed the Mexican negotiators which
                            would outline the restrictions on federal power, in respect of internal
                            taxes on liquor imposed by the states, implied in the twenty-first
                            amendment to the Constitution.</p>
                        <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>With regard to paragraph 1 of Article XVI, bringing the agreement into
                            force, the Mexicans stated that there would be no legal difficulty on
                            their side in complying with the provisions of this paragraph, that
                            following approval of the agreement by the Mexican Senate the President
                            would proclaim the agreement by means of a decree which would have a
                            similar status to the President’s proclamation in this country. It was
                            suggested to them that they might wish to refer to the Mexican document
                            as a decree rather than a proclamation. However, they felt that the word
                            “proclamation” would be an adequate description.</p>
                        <p>The Mexicans were handed draft language to be added to Article XI of the
                            agreement setting forth in a general way the procedure which would be
                            followed in Mexico in withdrawing or modifying concessions in Schedule I
                            of the agreement under the circumstances specified in the Article. They
                            said they saw no objection to this language but would study it
                            further.</p>
                        <p>No objection was raised by the Mexicans to the following drafting
                            changes, made necessary to meet proposals previously advanced by them:
                            1) the addition of the words “as soon as practicable” to the fifth
                            paragraph of Article VI; 2) the deletion of the termination provisions
                            of Article XII; and 3) the deletion from Article XVI of reference to
                            Article XII, made necessary by the removal from the latter of the
                            termination provisions referred to above.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the statements made by the Mexican negotiators in the
                            meeting on July 27 that no discriminatory internal taxes were imposed in
                            Mexico, either by the State or Federal Governments, the Mexicans were
                            handed copies of Mexican federal decrees setting forth the terms of such
                            discriminatory taxes in respect of tobacco products, pharmaceutical
                            products, packaged foods and beverages. They appeared to be unfamiliar
                            with these taxes but readily admitted that the differential taxes on
                            tobacco products appeared to be discriminatory. They advanced the theory
                            that the higher taxes on imported cigarettes might be an advantage to
                            legitimate traders by discouraging the illegal manufacture of American
                            brand cigarettes in Mexico. They sought to question the discriminatory
                            nature of the taxes on the other products mentioned on the grounds that
                            such charges were in reality fees proportionate to the cost of
                            registering and certifying national and foreign products. Señor Bueno
                            mentioned, for instance, the fact that government inspectors supervised
                            the production of domestic pharmaceutical and food products whereas it
                            was necessary in the case of foreign products to have special laboratory
                            analyses, thus involving higher costs. Señor Bueno also took the
                            inconsistent position that the higher charges on imported tobacco,
                            pharmaceutical and food products were “in connection with importation”
                            implying that they were in the same class as customs duties. Señor Saenz
                                <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0526"/>recorded the numbers and
                            dates of the decrees mentioned and it was agreed that the Mexicans would
                            get in touch with their government with a view to seeing what could be
                            done. He pointed out that since the trade agreement would have the
                            status of a treaty in Mexico it would override any inconsistent laws;
                            however, he thought it would be preferable to take care of any such
                            inconsistencies in advance.</p>
                        <p>Occasion was taken at this meeting to explain to the Mexicans the
                            internal tax situation regarding beer, on which a concession is proposed
                            in Schedule II. It was explained that under existing laws the internal
                            tax of $6.00 per barrel applies only to domestic beer, that this tax,
                            which would be increased to $7.00 per barrel or 230 per gallon if
                            pending legislation were enacted, has not yet been extended to the
                            imported product and that the provisions of the agreement relating to
                            compensating taxes would permit such extension. They were made aware of
                            the enhanced importance of the proposed concession on beer as an offset
                            to the possible extension of the increased tax, which would result in a
                            total charge of 73¢ per gallon on imports from Mexico if no duty
                            concession were granted as against 480 per gallon if the duty were
                            reduced by the maximum amount. At their request it was agreed that a
                            memorandum explaining the tax situation in respect of beer would be
                            prepared and handed to them at an early date.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Beteta came in at his request to inquire whether there had been any
                            developments in regard to the petroleum concession. I told him that Mr.
                                Davies<note n="30" xml:id="d506fn30">Ralph K. Davies, Deputy
                                Petroleum Administrator.</note> had this morning informed me that he
                            expected Mr. Ickes<note n="31" xml:id="d506fn31">Harold L. Ickes,
                                Secretary of the Interior and Petroleum Administrator.</note> to
                            return tomorrow and would make it his first order of business to discuss
                            this matter with him. Dr. Beteta seemed pleased at this evidence of
                            activity but took the occasion to elaborate on the difficult position he
                            has been placed in as a result of the long delay.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Beteta also mentioned the difficulty he would have even though he
                            receives shortly our full proposals in regard to concessions to Mexico
                            in obtaining the approval of his Government of greater concessions on
                            the Mexican side than those already offered. He mentioned in this
                            connection the misunderstanding on the part of the Mexican Embassy here
                            and of various officials in Mexico to the effect that the United States
                            would be content with bindings rather than <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513"
                                facs="0527"/>reductions of Mexican rates of duty. He mentioned
                            particularly the difficulty they would have in giving us any reductions
                            on agricultural products. He indicated, however, that once he receives
                            our offers, he would endeavor to get sympathetic consideration of our
                            requests for concessions from Mexico, intimating that it might be
                            necessary in that connection for him and the remaining members of his
                            delegation to return to Mexico for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, Dr. Beteta said that he had intended to seek an
                            appointment with Mr. Welles within the next few days to advise him that
                            in view of the pressing need for the services of the remaining members
                            of his trade-agreement delegation in Mexico and the long-continued delay
                            in receiving our proposals in regard to petroleum, he was planning to
                            leave with them for Mexico City in the near future. However, in view of
                            what he had learned, he said that he would not seek an appointment for
                            that purpose. I told him that we would keep him advised of developments
                            and expressed agreement with his view that once our full proposals are
                            made and his Government has had an opportunity to reconsider their
                            offers in the light of them, it should be possible to complete the
                            negotiations in very short time.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Beteta came in at 3 o’clock at his request to tell us that he had
                            definitely made up his mind that it would be necessary for him to leave
                            for Mexico City with the remaining members of the trade agreement
                            delegation as soon as transportation could be arranged. He said that
                            this did not in any sense mean the breaking off of negotiations nor even
                            discouragement on his part or on the part of his government concerning
                            the progress of the negotiations. He explained that he had been telling
                            his government almost daily for the past three or four weeks that our
                            offer of a petroleum concession was expected momentarily. In view of the
                            continued delay in getting our proposal on petroleum and various other
                            products he did not feel that he could continue to give such assurances
                            to his government notwithstanding the possibility that we might be able
                            to present a firm offer in regard to petroleum some time next week <pb
                                n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0528"/>following our discussion of the
                            matter with Petroleum Coordinator this morning.</p>
                        <p>He said that he thought it might be helpful to the negotiations rather
                            than otherwise for him to go to Mexico City at this time where he would
                            be able to explain the situation far better than he had been able to do
                            by telegrams and telephone calls. He also thought that his presence in
                            Mexico City would be helpful after the receipt of our full proposals in
                            connection with the concessions we are asking of Mexico. He emphasized
                            again as he has on previous occasions the great difficulty of granting
                            many of our requests on agricultural products and industrial products
                            which are manufactured to some extent in Mexico. He thought it possible,
                            although he could not, of course, guarantee anything, that given
                            satisfactory offers of concessions to Mexico on petroleum and other
                            important items he might be able to persuade his government to come
                            closer to meeting our original requests.</p>
                        <p>From the way he talked Dr. Beteta appears to be uncertain whether he will
                            continue as head of the Mexican trade agreement delegation. However, he
                            said that if his government decides to leave the negotiations in his
                            hands he would be ready to come back to Washington just as soon as
                            possible after a full proposal from us had been gone over with high
                            officials in Mexico City for the purpose of obtaining new instructions
                            designed to enable agreement to be reached in the shortest possible
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins told Dr. Beteta that we, of course, have appreciated the
                            difficulty of his position during the past three or four weeks and
                            likewise understand his desire to return to Mexico City for a short
                            time. He said further that although the matter was, of course, one for
                            his government to decide he hoped that Dr. Beteta would come back, after
                            discussions in Mexico City on the basis of proposals we hoped to be able
                            to make within a week or ten days, as head of the Mexican delegation.
                            Mr. Hawkins also explained the procedural steps involved in getting the
                            full proposal before the Mexican negotiators; expressed the importance
                            we attach to our Schedule I requests generally, which have been gone
                            over very carefully with a view to making them reasonable in the light
                            of what we hoped to be able to offer to Mexico in return; and pointed
                            out that the present may be the most favorable opportunity we will have
                            to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement between the two countries
                            of great value to both of them in the postwar period.</p>
                        <p>On leaving, Dr. Beteta said that he would appreciate it very much if
                            before his departure he could be informed of any further progress in
                            regard to the petroleum concession. He said he understood we could tell
                            him nothing definite as to the concession which might be offered but
                            that even an informal expression of our hopes in that <pb n="515"
                                xml:id="pg_515" facs="0529"/>regard would be deeply appreciated and
                            would be very helpful to him when he gets back to Mexico City.</p>

                            regard to the progress of trade-agreement negotiations with Mexico:</p>
                        <p>Owing to delay in obtaining views of Petroleum Coordinator this
                            Government has not yet presented a firm offer on petroleum. Although
                            this matter should be cleared up shortly, and this expectation has been
                            intimated to Dr. Beteta, latter intends to return to Mexico immediately
                            with remaining members of delegation. Dr. Beteta explained that his
                            departure did not mean breaking off of negotiations or discouragement on
                            part of himself or his government concerning the progress thereof, that
                            his presence in Mexico would be helpful in explaining the situation to
                            his government both with regard to petroleum and with regard to
                            concessions we are asking of Mexico, and that if continuation of
                            negotiations is left in his hands he would be ready to return to
                            Washington once our full proposals had been received and discussed with
                            high officials in Mexico City.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, once full proposals of this Government have been formulated,
                            which Department hopes will be within next 10 days, it is intended to
                            transmit them to Mexican Embassy here, with informational copies to
                            you.</p>

                            III of the proposed trade agreement with Mexico. Mention was made to him
                            of the desirability of early conclusion of the agreement, to which it
                            was hoped the Mexican Government could now see its way clear.</p>

                            <p>Reference is made to the negotiations between the Governments of the
                                United States of America and the United Mexican States looking
                                toward conclusion of a mutually beneficial trade agreement.</p>
                            <p>It will be recalled that public notice of intention to negotiate a
                                trade agreement was issued on April 4, 1942. Subsequently, the
                                representatives of the Mexican Government were handed a preliminary
                                draft text of the general provisions proposed for inclusion in the
                                agreement (memorandum dated May 26), a definitive list of the
                                concessions requested of Mexico by the United States (memorandum
                                dated July 20<note n="34" xml:id="d509fn34">Not printed.</note>),
                                and a partial list of the concessions offered to Mexico by the
                                United States (memorandum dated July 27<note n="34"
                                    xml:id="d509fn41">Not printed.</note> and supplementary list
                                transmitted on July 29<note n="34" xml:id="d509fn42">Not
                                    printed.</note>). In a memorandum dated July 6 the Mexican
                                Government set forth its views regarding the general provisions
                                suggested by the United States, and regarding the general scope of
                                the concessions which it anticipated each country would grant on
                                products of the other. On the basis of these documents conversations
                                between representatives of the two Governments took place in
                                Washington in July and August, during the course of which tentative
                                agreement was reached on all points of substance with the exception
                                of certain of the concessions in both schedules. It was agreed that
                                discussions regarding the definitive text would be begun as soon as
                                the Government of the United States might be in a position to
                                present a complete list of the concessions it is prepared to offer,
                                including a concession on petroleum.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States is now in a position to present
                                such a list. Accordingly, there are enclosed 1) a draft text<note

                            <p>With respect to Article II, providing for national treatment on
                                internal taxes, the representatives of the United States have
                                pointed out that, apart from the question raised by the twenty-first
                                amendment to the Constitution referred to below, pertinent federal
                                and State laws in the United States provide such treatment at the
                                present time except in respect of the federal internal revenue tax
                                on alcohol for industrial use, from which the domestic product alone
                                is exempt under Section 3070 of the Internal Revenue Code.<note
                                    n="36" xml:id="d509fn36">Stat. 355.</note> It was explained that
                                efforts are now being made to secure legislation which would remove
                                this tax discrimination, and it was tentatively agreed that, under
                                the circumstances, it would seem desirable to avoid inclusion in the
                                agreement of provisions specifically exempting industrial alcohol
                                from the applicable provisions of Article II and that an explanatory
                                memorandum to the Mexican Government would serve in lieu thereof.
                                Such a memorandum is enclosed.</p>
                            <p>With regard to internal charges imposed in Mexico, which are
                                understood to be higher on imported than on domestic articles in the
                                case of federal internal taxes or fees on tobacco products,
                                pharmaceutical products, packaged foods and beverages, and possibly
                                also certain other products, the representatives of the Mexican
                                Government have pointed out that since the trade agreement would
                                have the status of a treaty in Mexico, the provisions of Article II
                                would override prior laws inconsistent therewith. It was agreed,
                                however, that since it would seem desirable to remove such federal
                                internal tax differentials as exist between imported and domestic
                                articles before the agreement comes into force, the Mexican
                                representatives would explore this possibility with the appropriate
                                officials of their Government. With respect to internal taxes
                                imposed by the States of the Mexican Union, it is understood that
                                the States are prohibited by the Constitution from enacting
                                discriminatory tax legislation.</p>
                            <p>Article III of the general provisions, relating to quotas in general,
                                incorporates the clarifying language in respect of tariff quotas
                                which was drawn up at the request of the Mexican representatives
                                (paragraph 3). In addition, a sentence has been added to paragraph 2
                                providing for prior consultation between the two Governments with
                                regard to the share which the Government of either country may allot
                                to the other country in allocating quotas on any product in which
                                that country has an important interest. It is believed that this
                                sentence meets the views of the Mexican Government on the subject of
                                quota allocation as set forth in its memorandum dated July 6.</p>
                            <p>Article VIII is the same as the text agreed upon during the
                                conversations under reference, except that a sentence has been added
                                to the second paragraph to meet the request of the Mexican
                                representatives <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0532"/>that,
                                although the concession on any product included in Schedule III of
                                the agreement may be withdrawn or modified pursuant to the
                                provisions of paragraph 2 of Article VIII, the rate of duty on such
                                product would not in any event, so long as the agreement remains in
                                force, exceed the rate of duty imposed thereon on the day of the
                                signature of the agreement.</p>
                            <p>Article XIII, relating to freedom of transit, is a new Article
                                proposed for inclusion in the agreement at the suggestion of the
                                representatives of the Mexican Government. In this connection, the
                                Government of the United States desires to make clear that the
                                provisions of this Article would of course in no way affect transit
                                regulations imposed by the Government of either country for sanitary
                                purposes but, like other provisions of the agreement, would be
                                subject to the provisions of Article XVII exempting such
                                regulations, together with certain other measures, from the scope of
                                the agreement.</p>
                            <p>Article XVII, relating to measures customarily exempted from the
                                scope of commercial treaties and agreements, is the same as the text
                                of May 26 except that paragraph 2, subjecting certain provisions of
                                the agreement to the constitutional limitations on the authority of
                                the Federal Government of the United States, has been omitted as
                                unnecessary. It was agreed during the conversations under reference
                                that all of the provisions of the agreement would naturally be
                                understood as being subject to constitutional limitations on the
                                authority of both Governments, and that, accordingly, it would be
                                sufficient if the Mexican Government were provided with an
                                explanatory memorandum outlining the special situation in the United
                                States regarding potentially discriminatory State taxes on distilled
                                spirits which the deleted paragraph was originally intended to
                                cover. Such a memorandum is enclosed.</p>

                            <p>Specific comment regarding the concessions in Schedules II and III
                                now offered by the United States would appear to be required only in
                                the case of petroleum, cattle, beer, and the items with respect to
                                which the representatives of the Mexican Government have requested
                                concessions greater than those set forth in the lists dated July 27
                                and July 29 (turpentine, garlic, pineapples in bulk, tomatoes and
                                peppers).</p>

                            <p>With reference to petroleum, Mexico is offered in its own right the
                                maximum reduction in the rate of import tax under Section 3422 of
                                the Internal Revenue Code, from ½ cent per gallon to ¼ cent Per
                                gallon, without limitation as to the quantity which may enter at the
                                reduced rate of tax from Mexico or any other source. Such petroleum
                                would also be bound free of customs duty under paragraph 1710 of
                                Schedule II of the proposed agreement.</p>
                            <p>With regard to cattle, the concession offered provides for a rate of
                                duty of 1½ cents per pound on light, medium-weight and heavy cattle,
                                without limitation as to the quantity permitted to enter at that
                                rate, for the duration of the war. Thereafter, upon a finding by the
                                President of the United States that the abnormal situation in
                                respect of cattle and meats has terminated, the amounts permitted to
                                be entered at the rate of 1½ cents per pound in any calendar year
                                would be limited to 100,000 head of light cattle, 400,000 head of
                                medium-weight cattle and 225,000 head of heavy cattle, imports in
                                excess of these amounts to be dutiable at 2½ cents per pound. In the
                                event that the Government of Canada should, pursuant to the
                                provisions of its trade agreement with the United States, request
                                the allocation among sources of supply of the tariff quotas
                                contemplated in respect of light and heavy cattle, the Government of
                                the United States would consult with the Government of Mexico,
                                pursuant to the provisions of Article III referred to above and
                                included in the enclosed draft text, with regard to the shares of
                                such quotas to be allotted to Mexico.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the proposed concession on beer (paragraph 805),
                                there is enclosed a memorandum prepared at the request of the
                                Mexican representatives which outlines the situation in the United
                                States with regard to the federal internal tax on this product.</p>
                            <p>The further concessions requested by the Mexican representatives on
                                turpentine (paragraph 90), garlic (paragraph 770) and pineapples in
                                bulk (first item, paragraph 747) are now offered.</p>
                            <p>With regard to tomatoes in their natural state (paragraph 772), the
                                original offer of the United States provided for a reduction in duty
                                from 3 cents per pound to 2¼ cents per pound during the months of
                                December, January and February and to 2½ cents per pound during the
                                remaining months of the year. The present offer is a reduction in
                                duty to 1½ cents per pound throughout the year for the duration of
                                the war, following which, and upon determination by the President of
                                the United States that the abnormal situation in respect of tomatoes
                                has terminated, the rate of duty would be 2¼ cents per pound, also
                                on a yearly basis.</p>
                            <p>It has not been considered feasible to accede to the request of the
                                Mexican representatives that the rate of duty on peppers in their
                                natural state (paragraph 774) be reduced from 2½ cents per pound <pb

                            <p>Reference is made to the request of the representatives of the
                                Government of the United Mexican States, in connection with the
                                tariff concession on ale, porter, stout and beer which the
                                Government of the United States of America has offered to grant in
                                Schedule II of the proposed trade agreement between the two
                                countries, for an explanation of the existing internal tax situation
                                in the United States in respect of these articles.</p>
                            <p>Section 3150 of the United States Internal Revenue Code provides for
                                an internal revenue tax of $6.00 per barrel of 31 gallons “on all
                                beer, lager beer, ale, porter, and other similar fermented liquor,
                                containing one-half of one per centum, or more, of alcohol, brewed
                                or manufactured and sold, or removed for consumption or sale, within
                                the United States.” The Congress of the United States is now
                                considering legislation which would increase this tax.</p>
                            <p>While it will be noted from the quoted portions of the law given
                                above that the internal-revenue tax on ale, porter, stout and beer
                                at present applies only to such articles produced within the United
                                States, and is not imposed on such articles when imported from
                                Mexico or other foreign countries, the provisions of Article IX of
                                the proposed trade agreement, relating to compensating taxes, would
                                permit the extension of this tax, or any increased tax which might
                                be enacted, to the like imported articles.</p>

                            <p>During the course of the negotiations of the proposed trade agreement
                                with Mexico, it was pointed out to the representatives of the <pb
                                    n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0535"/>Government of the United
                                Mexican States that under the twenty-first amendment to the
                                Constitution of the United States broad powers have been granted to
                                the several States of the Union for the regulation of trade in
                                alcoholic beverages.</p>
                            <p>While the Department of State is unaware of any actual cases in which
                                a State of the Union has enacted legislation discriminating against
                                alcoholic beverages imported from Mexico or any other foreign
                                country as such, certain States have enacted legislation imposing
                                differential taxes or other special requirements applicable to
                                distilled spirits the product of areas, including other States of
                                the Union, beyond the borders of the States concerned. It is
                                possible that such legislation would be upheld by the courts as
                                valid under the twenty-first amendment to the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>It was pointed out to the Mexican representatives that, with regard
                                to this matter as in the case of any other, the provisions of the
                                trade agreement would of course be subject to the constitutional
                                limitations on the authority of the Governments of the respective
                                countries.</p>

                            <p>Reference is made to the conversations between representatives of the
                                Governments of the United States of America and the United Mexican
                                States, in connection with the proposed trade agreement between the
                                two countries, to the internal tax treatment of imported alcohol for
                                industrial use under existing laws of the United States.</p>
                            <p>During the course of these conversations, it was pointed out that
                                existing laws of the United States impose an internal-revenue tax of
                                $4.00 per proof gallon on alcohol, whether produced in the United
                                States or imported from any foreign country, and that consideration
                                is being given by the Congress, in connection with the pending tax
                                bill, to an increase in this tax; also, that while existing laws
                                authorize the withdrawal from bond without the payment of
                                internal-revenue tax of domestic alcohol for industrial use which
                                has been denatured under government supervision and meeting the
                                requirements prescribed by the Treasury Department, there is no
                                similar provision for the exemption from the tax of imported alcohol
                                for denaturation and use for industrial purposes.</p>
                            <p>Article II of the proposed trade agreement provides that products of
                                either country imported into the other country shall be exempt from
                                any internal tax or charge other or higher than that applicable to
                                like domestic products. The intent of these provisions is to <pb
                                    n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0536"/>assure for American exports
                                to Mexico, and reciprocally for imports from Mexico into the United
                                States, that whatever tariff or tax differential there may be
                                between imported products and like domestic products will be
                                measured by the customs duty on the imported product.</p>
                            <p>As a result of considerations advanced by representatives of the
                                Treasury Department and the Department of State, the Senate
                                Committee on Finance has decided to recommend that the pending tax
                                bill include provisions which would place imported alcohol for
                                denaturation and use for industrial purposes on the same basis, with
                                respect to internal-revenue taxes and exemptions, as domestic
                                alcohol. In the event that such provisions should, for unforeseen
                                reasons, fail to become law, the Department of State would renew its
                                efforts at an appropriate time.</p>

                            respect to the Trade Agreement proposals handed to the Mexican Embassy
                            in Washington on October 8.</p>
                        <p>I discussed the substance of the Department’s telegram under reference
                            with Undersecretary Torres Bodet today who informs me that the Mexican
                            Government is quite understanding of our reasons for desiring to
                            expedite the signature of the Trade Agreement. It is equally desirous of
                            concluding the agreement as soon as possible. He said the Mexican answer
                            had been held up because of the difficulties in getting together the
                            Economic Council of Ministers which has to pass on this matter. He
                            called attention to the fact that the Foreign Minister of Guatemala<note
                                n="43" xml:id="d511fn43">Carlos Salazar.</note> and President of
                                Ecuador<note n="44" xml:id="d511fn44">Carlos Arroyo del Río.</note>
                            are now making official visits to Mexico City and that in view of the
                            obligations which the Ministers have to attend various ceremonies in
                            this connection and at the same time carry on pressing duties he doubts
                            whether they can have a meeting of the Council before the beginning of
                            next week. He assured me however that the Council would meet early next
                            week and that we would have the answer shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>I gathered the impression from the Undersecretary very definitely that
                            the Mexican Government desires to collaborate with us in an early
                            conclusion of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>I shall take up the matter with him again in the early days of next week
                            if I do not get any answer from him.</p>

                        <p>A–895. I have to refer to the Department’s telegram 1525 of November 16,
                            11 a.m. [<hi rend="italic">p.m</hi>.], referring to instruction 1807 of
                            October 12 to this Embassy, transmitting information with respect to the
                            trade agreement proposals handed to the Mexican Embassy in Washington on
                            October 8 and to my airgram A–774, 11 a.m. of November 20.</p>
                        <p>I discussed again with the Foreign Office today the desirability of
                            concluding the trade agreement as soon as possible and found that the
                            Mexican Government is not only anxious of expediting the signature of
                            the trade agreement, as stated in my airgram A–774, 11 a.m. <pb n="524"
                                xml:id="pg_524" facs="0538"/>of November 20, but the Economic
                            Council of Ministers was in session discussing the trade treaty while I
                            was at the Foreign Office this morning. The Economic Council of
                            Ministers held its first meeting for discussion of the trade treaty on
                            Wednesday, December 2, and it was indicated to me today that the meeting
                            of the Economic Council of Ministers now in progress would probably
                            bring the matter to a conclusion. Mr. Tello said that he would talk to
                            Foreign Minister Padilla as soon as possible after the termination of
                            the meeting and pass on to me any available information about the
                            matter. The Department will be promptly advised.</p>
                        <p>Since writing the above, Mr. Tello of the Foreign Office telephoned me,
                            at 2:30 p.m. today, to tell me that he had discussed the question of the
                            trade treaty with Foreign Minister Padilla since the adjournment of the
                            meeting of the Economic Council of Ministers, which was held this
                            morning. He said that Minister Padilla had asked him to confirm to me
                            what he had said to me this morning, to the effect that it was the
                            purpose of the Ministers in their meeting of today to favorably approve
                            the trade treaty. He further stated that Lie. Padilla asked that I be
                            advised to the effect that at the adjournment of the Economic Council of
                            Ministers today (4th) the approval of the trade treaty was left in a
                            very advanced state and that there remained only a few details which the
                            Committee decided should be discussed with the Department in Washington.
                            He did not indicate to me just what the details were, but stated that
                            they should be very easy to adjust and that it was anticipated that they
                            would in no wise hinder the final approval of the trade treaty.
                            Accordingly, the Economic Council of Ministers decided to send to
                            Washington Ingeniero Carlos Arroyo, Chief of the Tariff Division of the
                            Treasury, who was scheduled to leave today by airplane for Washington.
                            Mr. Tello did not know whether he was able to make today’s plane, but
                            said that if he did not, he would leave tomorrow. Mr. Tello said that
                            the discussion of details in question would be taken up with the
                            Department through the Mexican Embassy on Monday or Tuesday of next
                            week.</p>

                            principal subjects discussed with Dr. Padilla during his recent visit to
                                Washington<note n="46" xml:id="d514fn46">Ezequiel Padilla, Mexican
                                Minister for Foreign Relations, arrived in Washington March 30,
                                1942.</note> was the desire of the Mexican Government to provide for
                            the construction of a high octane gasoline plant in Mexico, and as a
                            result of discussions with him it was agreed that such a plant should be
                            constructed as soon as the necessary equipment can be spared from this
                            country. For your strictly confidential information, it may be stated
                            that it now appears that because of the great demand for such equipment
                            and materials for essential expansion in this country to meet our war
                            needs, it will be at least one year, probably two years and possibly

                        <p>You will recall that in Dr. Padilla’s memorandum, transmitted with your
                            despatch no. 406 of March 19, 1942,<note n="47" xml:id="d514fn47">Not

                            of a high octane gasoline plant said to have been presented to the
                            Mexican Treasury by a Mr. Pawley.<note n="48" xml:id="d514fn48"

                            Padilla’s visit it was ascertained that the project referred to in his
                            memorandum was that of a Mr. E. W. Pauley.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pauley has discussed this project with officers of the Department and

                            here and to secure from him such views as he may wish to express in a
                            preliminary way for the guidance of those here who are engaged in this
                            work. A memorandum setting forth certain views of this Government<note

                            will be air mailed to you within a few days as a basis for such

                        <p>Meanwhile to expedite action by this Government on certain of the more
                            urgent problems particularly those having to do with Mexico’s need for
                            oil industry material and equipment this Government believes it would be
                            very desirable to have a small group of technical experts representing
                            this Government, jointly with representatives of Petroleos Mexicanos,
                            make a rapid field survey in Mexico. The purpose of this survey would be
                            to determine in a manner convincing to the various agencies of this
                            Government which have responsibility <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527"
                                facs="0541"/>for material allocation, the degree of urgency
                            appertaining to various types of material requested and the
                            practicability of substituting material and equipment slightly different
                            from that specifically requested but more readily available here. In
                            addition to facilitating prompt action on the problems of most pressing
                            urgency the rapid survey proposed would play a highly important part in
                            determining the subsequent action to be taken by this Government in
                            connection with various Mexican oil industry projects referred to it by
                            the Mexican Government and now under consideration here.</p>
                        <p>Both the immediate situation and the longer range program have been
                            discussed with Dr. Beteta,<note n="51" xml:id="d515fn51">Ramón Beteta,
                                appointed special Minister to the United States by the Mexican
                                Government to take care of economic matters and other matters
                                requiring urgent decisions.</note> with particular reference to the
                            desirability of making the rapid field survey mentioned and he has
                            expressed his agreement in the strongest terms.</p>
                        <p>It is the view of the Department that the formal initiative in this
                            matter should be taken by the Mexican Government but you may assure the
                            President that an invitation from his Government for this Government to
                            send a group of experts for the purpose described will receive prompt
                            and favorable attention. To have the invitation come from the Mexican
                            Government will, in the Department’s opinion, put the oil mission in a
                            relationship with Petroleos Mexicanos and perhaps with others more
                            favorable than would result if such a plan were urged from here.</p>
                        <p>A group consisting of about four experts in producing, refining,
                            transportation and engineering, could be sent from here within a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Because of the urgency of these problems it is requested that you discuss
                            the proposed oil mission with the President as soon as possible and
                            inform the Department as to the action that can be expected.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile every effort is being made to expedite clearance of the most
                            urgently needed repair and maintenance material.</p>

                            substance thereof. I found him informed of the conversations in progress

                            be sent to Mexico without delay to make a survey of the more urgent
                            problems of Mexico’s need for oil industry, machinery and equipment,

                            proceeded to a point at which it appears desirable that you have a
                            general discussion of the subject with President Camacho both to
                            acquaint him with the present situation here and to secure from him such
                            views as he may wish to express in a preliminary way for the guidance of
                            those here who are engaged in this work.<note n="52" xml:id="d517fn52"
                                >As a result of this instruction, the Ambassador drafted an informal
                                memorandum which he handed to the Minister for Foreign Relations for
                                presentation to the President. A copy of the memorandum was

                                3498, August 24 (not printed).</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A certain amount of information on this subject may have been
                            communicated to the President through Dr. Beteta who, with
                            representatives of Petroleos Mexicanos, has been invited to participate
                            closely in the work of committees and individuals involved in this
                            problem here. To be certain, however, that the President has a clear
                            understanding of the views of this Government at this stage in its
                            considerations it is thought advisable that you informally acquaint him
                            with the ideas and activities described herein.</p>
                        <p>In as much as certain aspects of the general problem require prompt
                            attention it is hoped that you will report to the Department upon the
                            outcome of your discussions with the President as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>As background for the present views of this Government the following may
                            be said:</p>
                        <p>First. While this Government is aware of Mexico’s urgent need for
                            materials and equipment in order to establish and maintain an adequate
                            supply of petroleum products for military and civilian activities, it is
                            imperatively necessary in our joint interest that the limited supply of
                            critical material in this hemisphere be used only <pb n="529"
                                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0543"/>in services which bear important and
                            current relation to the war effort or to essentials of Mexican national
                            economy. This fact requires that in appraising Mexico’s needs for such
                            material account be taken not only of its importance in relation to
                            Mexico’s general program for the development of its oil industry, but
                            also the importance of time in connection with each unit in that
                            program. It is emphasized that the considerations just mentioned have to
                            do principally with priority of importance in relation to time, and are
                            not aimed at appraising the soundness of Mexico’s long range program for
                            the development of its pretroleum industry.</p>
                        <p>Second. From the long range point of view this Government recognizes that
                            the interests of this nation in petroleum supply are closely and
                            inherently linked with those of Mexico. This community of interest
                            applies of course among all the nations of the Western Hemisphere. The
                            various problems of reserves for future hemispheric defense and economic
                            development, or of supplies of finished products for war emergencies or
                            essential civilian occupations, or of transportation, or of export
                            trade, cannot be solved unless regarded as matters of mutual
                            international concern. From this viewpoint this Government has the
                            deepest interest in Mexico’s problems and plans in respect of oil. While
                            the war has intensified the appreciation of this mutual interest, and
                            given special urgency to certain of its aspects, this Government regards
                            the long range oil policy of Mexico as chiefly important because it is a
                            basic element in Mexico’s national development and, consequently, in the
                            development of this hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Third. Various agencies of this Government have before them for action,
                            and have had for some time several particular matters in connection with
                            the Mexican oil industry on which final action has not yet been taken.
                            Delay in dealing with these affairs has been due at least in part to a
                            lack of information here as to the relative importance of various parts
                            of the projects involved, the possibility of substituting different
                            material or equipment to accomplish an equivalent result, and, in
                            general, lack of information as to the overall program of oil industry
                            development toward which the Mexican Government is working.</p>
                        <p>Fourth. The conclusion of the oil property appraisal entrusted by the two
                            governments to the Cooke-Zevada mission<note n="53" xml:id="d517fn53"
                                >Oil commission created to conduct evaluation proceedings with
                                reference to properties expropriated by the Mexican Government;
                                Morris L. Cooke was the American representative and Manuel J.
                                Zevada, the Mexican representative.</note> in conjunction with the
                            recent Trade Agreement<note n="54" xml:id="d517fn54">For correspondence
                                concerning the negotiations leading to the trade agreement, signed

                                ff.</note> and other current evidences of mutual understanding
                            between the two nations, marks this as a singularly propitious moment in
                            the history of the Mexican oil industry. It is the view of this
                            Government, having in mind the part which it has played in bringing
                            about the present opportunity for reorganization, that nothing, except
                            the exigencies of war, should be permitted to interfere with the sound
                            and orderly reestablishment of the oil industry in Mexico. Particularly
                            it would regard it as unfortunate if, under the pressure which is
                            inevitable in such critical times, the immediate policies and plans of
                            the Mexican Government for the rehabilitation of its oil industry
                            contained the seeds of trouble <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0544"
                            />which ultimately might leave both Mexico and the hemisphere of which
                            it is so significant a part without the advantages for which such great
                            pains have been suffered. This Government has shown its readiness to
                            assist in every appropriate way toward safeguarding against such an
                            occurrence.</p>
                        <p>First. With the ideas indicated in the foregoing paragraphs in mind this
                            Government has recently taken steps to bring to a focus the attention of
                            the interested agencies of this Government upon the several Mexican oil
                            matters which had hitherto been regarded more or less as detached
                            problems. These matters include the following: <list>

                        <p>Second. In connection with these problems this Department has assigned
                            certain duties, particularly the duty of coordinating the relevant
                            activities of various government agencies and preparing recommendations
                            for definitive action, upon the Foreign Petroleum Policy Committee. That
                            Committee includes representatives of the following Government
                            departments: Department of State, War Department, Navy Department,
                            Office of Petroleum Coordinator for War, Board of Economic Warfare, War
                            Production Board and Lend-Lease Administration. It is with
                            representatives of this Committee, as well as with members of this
                            Department, that Dr. Beteta and his colleagues have been invited to
                            collaborate, as referred to earlier in this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>As an outcome of the work done to date by that Committee, and based upon
                            such information as it has been able to secure, it has made a
                            preliminary report with certain preliminary recommendations which can be
                            summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Maintenance materials are urgently needed for
                            producing operations and refineries. Certain of these materials cannot
                            be delayed without greatly aggravating present deterioration and
                            inviting complete failure or disastrous accidents.</p>
                        <p>Steps have been taken, with the assistance of Petroleos Mexicanos
                            representatives who are now here, to select the materials most urgently
                            needed and to facilitate the issuance of priorities and export licenses
                            covering those particular items.</p>
                        <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0545"/>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The petroleum transportation and distribution
                            services within Mexico appear to be inadequately organized and suffer
                            from lack of proper equipment. Particularly in case of war emergency,
                            failure of these services might be serious. It is proposed that Colonel
                            Hill, now engaged in making a general survey of railroads in Mexico,
                            assist the petroleum mission on this problem, in so far as rail
                            transportation is concerned. The technical mission will examine, with
                            appropriate Mexican officials, other phases of the problem.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Present refining processes and equipment are
                            incapable of producing the quality of product which would be required by
                            mechanized military forces.</p>
                        <p>These refineries should be examined critically to determine the best
                            methods of supplementing, replacing or modifying equipment, and
                            adjusting processes and operating procedure to secure optimum results.
                            Particular emphasis should be given to the utilization of already
                            fabricated equipment now available in the United States. (For example
                            there are several small modern refineries here which have been operated
                            very little or not at all, units of which might be transferred very
                            quickly to Mexico.)</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) There is a great wastage of rich gas at Poza
                            Rica, which not only wastes the valuable products contained therein but,
                            even more importantly, will lead to premature exhaustion of the Poza
                            Rica field itself.</p>
                        <p>Determination should be made of a proper installation for recovering
                            natural gasoline from this gas, and of the best utilization of this
                            product. Prompt and competent consideration should be given also to
                            returning part of the gas to the structure for re-pressuring the
                            field.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) Attention should be given to the condition of
                            the Tehuantepec railroad and to the terminal facilities at Salina Cruz
                            and east coast ports. In an emergency these facilities might be needed
                            for the transportation and storage of war essential oil supplies.
                            (Colonel Hill would assist on this.)</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Means should be determined for increasing the
                            supply and use of tetraethyl lead.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) Appraisal of other problems and plans, such as
                            the proposals of certain American interests to carry out particular
                            projects in Mexico, requires a fuller knowledge than the Committee now
                            possesses concerning the accomplishment of essential work not covered by
                            such proposals (and raises certain other questions which will be
                            mentioned later). Approval by this Government, in so far as its approval
                            is required or requested, should be deferred until certain questions can
                            be answered.</p>
                        <p>Growing out of the foregoing considerations by the Committee there is the
                            further recommendation that, if the proposal be agreeable to Mexican
                            authorities, a small group of experts drawn from agencies of this
                            Government be invited by Mexico to make a rapid field survey, jointly
                            with Petroleos Mexicanos, of the installations and circumstances
                            involved in the problems now under consideration. It is not suggested
                            that certain urgently necessary action be deferred until such a survey
                            has been completed. It is pointed out, however, that many questions
                            which now stand in the way of prompt action would <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0546"/>be cleared very quickly by following
                            the course recommended. The Department concurs in this belief and
                            suggests that you place appropriate emphasis on this proposal in your
                            discussion with the President.</p>
                        <p>Third. In addition to the technical aspects of these problems which have
                            been the subject of the Committee’s study thus far, there are other
                            aspects concerning which the Department itself would like to know
                            informally the view of President Camacho. Based upon technical
                            considerations alone it is possible to formulate a sound and
                            comprehensive program according to which orderly development of the
                            Mexican oil industry might proceed, beginning with presently necessary
                            repair work and, progressively, modifying and supplementing facilities
                            to meet the domestic requirements, the war requirements and finally the
                            full export possibilities of the industry. With at least the first steps
                            in such a program this Government is prepared to assist as has been
                            indicated. It is likewise willing to assist in all appropriate ways in
                            the formulation of the comprehensive program itself. In the execution of
                            such a plan, however, a point is soon reached at which it becomes
                            desirable to know the policies and intentions of the Mexican Government
                            concerning such matters as the conditions under which and the manner in
                            which foreign interests will be requested or permitted to participate.
                            Thus, for example, is it the intention of the Mexican Government to: <list>

                                <item>Permit individual private foreign interests to conduct certain

                                    Government; allowing opportunity for profits, in excess of fixed
                                    obligations, to accrue to the private company as inducement to
                                    undertake the risks inherent in certain activities of this
                                    industry, or</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the event that the Mexican Government has in mind to permit the
                            participation of private foreign interests, this Government would be
                            interested to know the attitude of the Mexican Government towards such
                            participation by American oil companies.</p>
                        <p>In your discussion with the President you should make it clear that
                            inquiries such as the foregoing concerning Mexican oil policy do not
                            reflect any desire on the part of this Government to interfere in any
                            way with the freedom of the Mexican Government to determine its <pb
                                n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0547"/>own oil policy. It is clear,
                            however, that when this Government is called upon to consider questions
                            involving financial or other substantial assistance, or involving
                            hemispheric security both military and economic, or involving nationally
                            important activities of its own citizens abroad, it must be in position
                            to judge the long range consequences of its own actions. All these are
                            questions which, in the present case, this Government neither desires
                            nor expects to avoid.</p>
                        <p>The purpose in asking you to discuss this entire situation frankly and
                            informally with the President is to prepare the way for prompt and
                            effective cooperation between appropriate agencies and individuals of
                            both Governments who are directly concerned in the petroleum aspects of
                            the general accord which exists between these two nations. It was with
                            this in mind that this Government formulated the proposal, discussed
                            earlier, to view the several detached problems now under consideration
                            as parts of a comprehensive program, the basic characteristics of which
                            will be determined by certain policies of the Mexican Government.</p>

                        <p>1161. In response to the invitation from the President of Mexico,
                            contained in your 855 of July 28, that this government send a mission
                            composed of oil experts to make a survey of Mexico’s oil industry
                            jointly with representatives of Petroleos Mexicanos, you are requested
                            to inform the President and other appropriate officials that
                            arrangements have been made for such a mission to leave here within the
                            next few days.</p>
                        <p>The objectives of the mission will be as indicated in Department’s
                            telegram 1061 of July 25 and more fully in Department’s instruction no.
                            1336 of August 6. It should be understood that the technical work of the
                            mission may follow whatever detailed course is jointly agreed upon
                            between the oil mission and the representatives of Petroleos Mexicanos
                            within the general scope indicated.</p>
                        <p>The oil mission will work under your general responsibility and authority
                            and will have no direct relations with either the Government of Mexico
                            nor Petroleos Mexicanos except through arrangements made by you.
                            Similarly all relations with the local press will be through the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Everett DeGolyer has been appointed Chief of the oil mission. He is a
                            retired consulting geologist of high attainments and <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0548"/>excellent personal and professional
                            reputation. He has no connections of present significance with any
                            particular oil company. He has been instructed to report to you upon
                            arrival which should be Sunday, August 23 by Pan-American Airways from
                            Brownsville, Texas.</p>
                        <p>Other members of the mission will include: <list>
                                <item>A. C. Chapman, production and general engineering</item>
                                <item>Earle Gard, refining technologist</item>
                                <item>Frank Mack, refinery construction and maintenance</item>
                                <item>G. W. Wattles, representative of Materials Division of War
                                    Production Board</item>
                                <item>J. Murrell, technical assistant to chief of oil
                                    mission.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>All members of the mission are expected to be in Mexico City by August
                            23.</p>
                        <p>It is the intention of this government to defray all expenses of the
                            mission including salaries, transportation to and from Mexico City and
                            sustenance while in Mexico. This government is willing to pay such other
                            direct expenses of the mission as are incurred in the performance of its
                            official functions, such as local transportation, local office expense,
                            et cetera, but is inclined to believe that since the work there will be
                            joint with Petroleos Mexicanos it may be more satisfactory if such local
                            expenses are met by the Mexican Government. Your own views on this are
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that the work now contemplated can be completed in
                            approximately three weeks. It is quite possible that certain of the
                            experts will complete their particular assignments ahead of the others,
                            or that certain ones will be required to remain somewhat longer. It is
                            possible that during the progress of the work now in mind the
                            desirability will be seen of calling for other experts to continue some
                            special line of investigation even after the mission has completed its
                            present assignment. It is the view of this government that such a
                            development would be desirable as a means of giving continuity to the
                            joint effort now getting under way.</p>
                        <p>It should be made clear to the Mexican authorities that this mission is
                            sent by and represents this government and not any particular department
                            or division thereof. All members of this mission are employees of this
                            government.</p>
                        <p>If as a result of your recent conversations with the President and other
                            officials you believe that any of the foregoing instructions should be
                            modified the Department will be glad to have your views.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: The Foreign Petroleum Policy
                            Committee has reviewed the report of the Mission of Oil Experts to
                            Mexico, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>Producing operations currently require only maintenance and operating
                            materials, but an expanded program of exploration drilling must be
                            undertaken soon to strengthen the fast deteriorating reserve position.
                            This is a very large undertaking and one that will require careful
                            study.</p>
                        <p>The refineries, however, urgently require both maintenance and expansion
                            materials in order to continue current operations and to fulfill
                            requirements which may arise out of the war emergency.</p>
                        <p>The most important steps in the refinery expansion program have been
                            recommended as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Additions to the Mexico City Refinery to raise the crude
                                    distillation capacity from 18,000 barrels per day to 28,000
                                    barrels per day.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Installation of heavy oil cracking units of 15,000 barrels per
                                    day capacity at the Mexico City Refinery.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Mexico City Refinery operates on crude transported by pipeline, and
                            the enlarged plant will satisfy the full requirements of the central
                            plateau area, which is at present partially served by products
                            laboriously and inefficiently carried by rail tank car.</p>
                        <p>The expanded operations of the Mexico City Refinery will yield certain
                            products and gases which constitute the raw feed for the manufacture of
                            high octane aviation gasoline. It is, therefore, considered desirable to
                            install additional equipment for processing these raw materials into
                            aviation gasoline in the amount of 1000 barrels per day.</p>
                        <p>The primary distillation and cracking equipment should be obtained from
                            shutdown refineries in the United States, whereas the high octane
                            manufacturing facilities will have to be ordered from manufacturers with
                            the delivery schedule integrated into the overall program of the
                            worldwide high octane gasoline plant constructions.</p>
                        <p>Petroleos Mexicanos should arrange for the construction of these new
                            units by established firms of United States engineers and contractors.
                            These firms should also be charged with the operations of the expanded
                            units until Mexican personnel can be properly trained to take over.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Petroleum Policy Committee approves of the procedure outlined
                            above and recommends that the Mexico City Refinery expansion be
                            approved.</p>

                        <p>1650. The recommendations of the Mission of Oil Experts which relate to
                            materials and equipment required for the repair and extension of Mexican
                            oil refineries and for the construction of certain new plants and
                            facilities have been approved and endorsed by this Department and steps
                            will be taken to facilitate the priority allocations which will be
                            necessary to secure the material. It is assumed that the Mexican
                            Government will consult us with regard to securing the services of
                            competent American manufacturers who are well established in this
                            specialized field of work for the design and erection of this equipment
                            and for training of operators if necessary, thus insuring the most
                            efficient use of the material which is to be spared for the purpose.
                            This Department is prepared to be of the utmost assistance in making
                            such arrangements.</p>
                        <p>A summary of the portion of the mission’s report which relates to such
                            plants is being forwarded to you. You are requested to transmit it to
                            the appropriate officials with the suggestion that it be reviewed by
                            them and that in due course they send appropriate representatives to
                            discuss with the Department the arrangements they propose for
                            prosecuting the work in so far as American manufacturers or contractors
                            are concerned. This Department will arrange for securing the assistance
                            of other agencies of this Government whenever this will be helpful.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the project for the construction of the 100 octane
                            gasoline plant, it is our desire that negotiations for the erection and
                            management of this plant be carried on between representatives of our
                            two Governments. With this in view the Government agencies concerned
                            here are now consulting with each other and should be in a position

                            instruction no. 557 of May 7, 1942<note n="55" xml:id="d521fn55">Not

                            appropriate agencies of this Government for the importation of workers
                            from Mexico to supply the increasing demand for labor, especially in
                            agriculture, during the existing emergency.</p>
                        <p>In further conferences with representatives of other agencies of the
                            Government the Department’s representatives have continued to make it
                            clear that the Department has no facilities for determining the extent
                            to which it may become necessary to seek labor from other countries;
                            that such determination must therefore be made by other agencies; that
                            any importation of labor from Mexico must be approved by the Mexican
                            Government; and that in seeking the approval of that Government it would
                            be highly desirable to present a well formulated program providing
                            adequate guarantees against a repetition of difficulties which have
                            resulted from the immigration of Mexican workers in the past. It has
                            also been made clear that in the event of the importation of Mexican
                            workers the Department of State would have no authority in such matters
                            as transportation of workers to and from this country, and wages and
                            treatment while in this country, its sole function being the
                            presentation for the consideration of the Mexican Government of such
                            proposals as might be formulated by the appropriate agencies of this
                            Government having jurisdiction over matters of this nature.</p>
                        <p>It has now been determined by the appropriate agencies of this Government
                            that there is a shortage of 6,000 workers in the beet sugar areas of
                            California, Idaho and Montana, and a program has been prepared by those
                            agencies in collaboration with the sugar beet growers’ associations, for
                            the importation of workers from Mexico. In this connection there are
                                enclosed<note n="56" xml:id="d521fn56">Enclosures not

                            Workers in the Production, Cultivation or Harvesting of Sugar Beets on
                            Farms in the United States”. The Department understands that it is
                            likely that waiver of the contract labor provisions will be made in the
                            near future to permit the importation of an additional 3,000 workers for
                            the sugar beet areas of Idaho and Montana, and that requests are under
                            consideration for the importation of workers needed in the production of
                            other crops, notably long staple cotton.</p>
                        <p>It therefore becomes necessary to approach the Mexican Government with
                            respect to the question of permitting the temporary emigration to this
                            country of workers to meet our emergency needs, and you are requested to
                            discuss this question with the Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="59"
                                xml:id="d521fn59">Ezequiel Padilla.</note> at your earliest
                            opportunity. In your discussion you should mention that this Government
                            is reluctant to make such a request and state that it does so only
                            because of the absolute need as a war measure not only of maintaining
                            but increasing our agricultural production despite the fact that large
                            numbers of agricultural workers have been called into the armed forces
                            and into war industries.</p>
                        <p>You should also indicate clearly to the Foreign Minister that this
                            Government is aware of the unfortunate conditions which many Mexican
                            workers have encountered in the past and is disposed to make every
                            possible effort to prevent a repetition of those conditions if
                            additional workers are permitted to come to this country for temporary
                            employment to meet the existing emergency. In this connection you should
                            outline the conditions of employment and treatment proposed in the
                            communications from the Attorney General and Chairman of the War
                            Manpower Commission.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that in your preliminary conversation you should not seek the
                            immediate approval of the plans which have been formulated for the
                            importation of workers, although outlining them sufficiently to indicate
                            the desire of this Government to provide adequate safeguards, but should
                            seek an immediate expression of the Mexican Government’s attitude toward
                            the temporary emigration of workers to this country. In this connection
                            a member of the Mexican Embassy has informally stated that in his
                            opinion the Mexican Government would be opposed in principle to the
                            importation of Mexican workers into this country, but that as an
                            emergency measure it might agree if adequate safeguards are provided for
                            the workers and a joint international commission is established to
                            supervise and control the movement.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s belief that if you ascertain that the Mexican
                            Government would be disposed as an emergency measure to permit <pb
                                n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0553"/>the temporary emigration of
                            workers to this country, it would be desirable for representatives of
                            the appropriate agencies of this Government (Departments of Agriculture,
                            Labor and Justice and the War Manpower Commission), and possibly a
                            representative of the sugar beet growers concerned, to proceed
                            immediately to Mexico to assist in making detailed arrangements with the
                            appropriate Mexican officials. This belief is based largely upon the
                            fact that because of the urgency of the need for additional workers,
                            whatever action may be taken in this matter should be taken as soon as
                            possible. While the broader phases of the program formulated by the
                            other agencies of this Government, as set forth in the enclosures, are
                            reasonably clear and doubtless will meet with the approval of the
                            Mexican Government, a number of points will undoubtedly require
                            clarification and it is likely that the Mexican Government will insist
                            upon other conditions not included in the present program. Accordingly,
                            it would seem essential that representatives of the appropriate agencies
                            take an active part in the detailed discussions with the Mexican
                            officials in order that the questions which will undoubtedly arise may
                            be settled promptly and authoritatively.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information it may be stated that the Department
                            believes it highly desirable that representatives of the other agencies
                            mentioned take an active part in the negotiations in order that they may
                            be fully impressed with the necessity of adopting adequate measures to
                            insure the compliance with all commitments made to the Mexican
                            Government with respect to conditions under which Mexican workers would
                            be brought into this country.</p>
                        <p>For your information, it may be stated that if the Mexican Government
                            should propose the establishment of a joint commission for the control
                            of the proposed labor movement, it is probable that arrangements for
                            such a commission could be made. However, it is extremely unlikely that
                            a commission could be established and begin to function soon enough to
                            make arrangements for the importation of the sugar beet workers referred
                            to herein.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to report by telegram the results of your conversation
                            with the Foreign Minister and, if the Mexican Government indicates a
                            willingness to permit the proposed movement provided adequate safeguards
                            are established and to discuss arrangements therefor with
                            representatives of this Government, whether you concur with the
                            Department’s belief that it would be desirable for representatives of
                            the agencies concerned to proceed to Mexico City for that purpose.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s strictly confidential air mail instruction
                            No. 804 of June 8, 1942, referring to its instruction No. 557 of May 7,

                            regarding proposals under consideration by the appropriate agencies of
                            our Government for the importation of workers from Mexico to supply the
                            increasing demand for labor, especially in agriculture, during the
                            existing emergency. I also have to acknowledge the receipt of the
                            Department’s strictly confidential instruction No. 848 of June 12,
                                1942,<note n="61" xml:id="d522fn61">Not printed.</note> referring to

                            parenthetically, I wish to note that the instructions of June 8 and June
                            12 under reference both reached this Embassy on June 15, 1942. This is
                            characteristic of the delays to which the air mail from the Department
                            to this Embassy is subjected somewhere along the route. There is no
                            reason to believe that this delay is caused in Mexico, but that it
                            occurs somewhere along the route in the United States after the
                            Department has mailed the envelopes.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on the receipt of the instructions under reference the
                            Embassy took up this matter informally with the Ministry of Foreign
                            Relations. The proposal and its importance to us was presented to the
                            Ministry and the desire was expressed that we be given an indication at
                            the earliest possible moment whether the Mexican Government would be
                            prepared in principle to enter into conversations on this subject. It
                            was emphasized that we were not taking up the matter with respect to any
                            arrangement of detail at this moment, but that if the Mexican Government
                            was prepared to consider the matter my Government was prepared to send
                            appropriate officials immediately to discuss the matter. We did not
                            leave any written communication with the Ministry, but did leave a copy
                            of the proposed contract provisions<note n="61" xml:id="d522fn62">Not
                                printed.</note> which was an enclosure to instruction No. 804 of
                            June 8, 1942.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry agreed to give the matter its immediate consideration and to
                            give a reply as promptly as possible, but called attention to the fact
                            that it was a matter on which various agencies of the Mexican Government
                            would have to be consulted. Our attention was also directed to the fact
                            that the matter involved, in itself, considerations which it would be
                            difficult to solve in spite of the best will of both Governments.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0555"/>
                        <p>I took occasion this morning to discuss this matter with the Under
                            Secretary, Mr. Torres Bodet, during the temporary absence of the
                            Minister. I found him fully informed. He said that immediately on our
                            bringing this matter to the attention of the Ministry it had given it
                            consideration and it was being given consideration in other Ministries
                            and agencies of the Mexican Government which had to be consulted,
                            principally the Ministries of Labor and Gobernación. He said their study
                            of the matter was being facilitated as much as possible; that it had not
                            been completed and would not be completed for several weeks. This delay
                            was not due to any lack of diligence but due to the necessity of going
                            into the matter very carefully.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary went on to say that naturally there were important
                            aspects of the problem for both governments to consider. He said Mexican
                            labor had gone to the United States before and the results had not been
                            too good. There were these discriminations which had taken place against
                            Mexican labor and the Mexican Government understood that no action by
                            our Government could remove these discriminations in a short period of
                            time; that they were the result of local action rather than of
                            government. It would be undesirable when our relationships were on such
                            a good basis that any element should be injected into these
                            relationships which would bring about a renewal of any former
                            situations. He said there were internal factors which the Mexican
                            Government had to consider and that some of these were serious. In the
                            first place, the news that labor could be recruited for the United
                            States would immediately bring about a considerable number of requests
                            to go in the belief that they were going to an Eldorado. The Mexican
                            Government had to consider that the wages of the laborers in the United
                            States would be considerably greater than in Mexico. They had to
                            consider that these laborers would go for a temporary period. On their
                            return these laborers would be dissatisfied with the conditions which
                            would be theirs. As a rule the laborers return having spent all of their
                            money and their position in some ways was worse after they returned than
                            before they went. Problems in this respect had been created for the
                            Mexican Government under similar circumstances. He said that various
                            agencies of the Mexican Government were carefully studying the matter to
                            determine what action would, in their opinion, have to be taken by our
                            Government and by the Mexican Government in order to insure that such a
                            temporary movement of laborers would not prove to be a distressing or
                            disturbing factor for either our country or for Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Among other things he said the Mexican Government was studying the
                            possibility of setting up an organization which would receive a certain
                            part of the wages of the laborers in trust for them until they returned
                            to Mexico. In other words, they were considering that a <pb n="542"
                                xml:id="pg_542" facs="0556"/>percentage of the wages of the laborers
                            should be paid in the United States and a certain part should be
                            retained by this Government organization which would return the money to
                            the laborers on their return to Mexico. They were also considering the
                            possibility that they receive a certain amount of their wages in the
                            form of farm implements which they could use in tilling small tracts of
                            land on their return to Mexico. This would help to alleviate the
                            problems arising through dissatisfaction of the laborers on their return
                            to their country.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary showed by the foregoing and other remarks which he
                            made that the matter was receiving the earnest consideration of the
                            Mexican Government but that it was concerned with the problems involved.
                            He did not say so, but it was clear from his discussion that it was the
                            desire of the Mexican Government to avoid creating any new problems in
                            our relationships when we were endeavoring to solve old problems and
                            were engaged in an active program of collaboration.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that the Mexican Government was giving this
                            matter its serious consideration because we were allies in the war and
                            it desired to help in any way that it could. He said there was
                            unemployed labor in Mexico and there was need of these agricultural
                            workers in the United States. The Mexican Government, therefore, was
                            earnestly seeking a basis on which such a movement of laborers could
                            take place without such a movement becoming a disturbing influence in
                            our relationships. He said that it would be unwise for the Mexican
                            Government to proceed on such a program without being absolutely sure of
                            its ground, as otherwise it would only create a ground for criticism of
                            the United States on the part of those who were always prepared to
                            criticize but who had to be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>I expressed to the Under Secretary our appreciation of the attention
                            which he was giving this matter and of what was obviously the
                            sympathetic consideration which the various agencies of the Mexican
                            Government had already accorded it. I told him I appreciated the need
                            for the time under the best circumstances for them to formulate their
                            thoughts, but remarked that these laborers were needed for agricultural
                            work, some of which was already starting. I said it would be helpful if
                            I could tell my Government that the attitude of the Mexican Government
                            was sympathetic to the idea. He said that I could inform my Government
                            that the Mexican Government was earnestly seeking to find a basis for
                            such a movement of laborers, but that it was not yet prepared to discuss
                            details. I said I would like to revert to our original discussion of
                            this matter when we stated that if the Mexican Government was
                            sympathetic to the idea we would <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0557"
                            />like to send several competent persons to discuss the matter with the
                            appropriate officials here.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he did not think the time had yet arrived
                            for anyone to come from the United States to discuss this matter; that
                            the Mexican officials had not yet come to the point where they were
                            actually prepared to discuss the matter with anyone else. He thought
                            that by the tenth of July they would be prepared to do so. I said that
                            this was going to delay considerably any solution and that there were
                            pressing reasons for proceeding as rapidly as possible. The Under
                            Secretary said that he appreciated all these factors but that he thought
                            arriving at a proper solution and arrangement was even more important
                            than any precipitate action. He emphasized again that the nature of the
                            matter was such that it would have to be given the most careful
                            consideration by the various agencies of the Mexican Government and that
                            this was in progress.</p>
                        <p>While the Under Secretary did not mention them, he undoubtedly had in
                            mind the newspaper reports coming from Washington on this labor matter.
                            Various articles have appeared in the press here from the news agencies
                            in Washington calling attention to the statements of Senator
                                Wheeler<note n="63" xml:id="d522fn63">Burton K. Wheeler, Senator
                                from Montana.</note> in this connection. These have served no useful
                            purpose here. The Under Secretary undoubtedly fears any publicity on
                            this matter at this time and he is entirely correct, in my opinion, in
                            this. The matter has to be carefully handled and there should be no
                            publicity of any kind until the final arrangements between the two
                            governments are reached. I think I should say frankly that the publicity
                            so far given to this matter in the press at home has not helped the
                            matter here.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary agreed that I could inform the Department that the
                            Mexican Government was sympathetic to the idea solely on the ground of a
                            cooperative measure with our Government in view of the war. The Mexican
                            Government was not prepared to say yet that an agreement could be made.
                            It was prepared to say that it was viewing and examining the matter in
                            an entirely sympathetic manner in the hope that a satisfactory
                            arrangement can be reached. The Under Secretary said that I could inform
                            my Government that if several competent persons came here between July
                            10 and 15 he felt confident that the Mexican officials would be prepared
                            to discuss the matter with them and expressed the hope and the belief
                            that a satisfactory arrangement could be worked out. He indicated,
                            however, that if several such persons did come here around July 10 for
                            this purpose, there should be no public announcement at home or here
                            with regard to the matter and no publicity with respect to the
                            negotiations or the visit. He also expressed the opinion that it would
                            be helpful if the competent persons who came here were able to speak <pb
                                n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0558"/>Spanish, as the Ministers and
                            officials of the Mexican Government with whom they would have to talk
                            would speak only that language and that it would greatly facilitate
                            matters and complete understanding if the Americans were able to speak
                            Spanish.</p>
                        <p>I am in thorough agreement with the observations of the Under Secretary
                            with regard to publicity which I consider most important. There is no
                            certainty that an agreement can be reached, although I have the personal
                            belief that, in view of the sympathetic view which the Mexican
                            Government is taking, an agreement can be worked out. It is clear,
                            however, that the Mexican Government is not going to permit itself to be
                            hurried into any decision, as it believes that the present status of
                            Mexican-American relations is more important than the possibility of
                            injecting a discordant note through this labor exchange. It wishes to
                            take all the proper precautions to assure that such a labor exchange
                            will not create a problem either here or in the United States or between
                            the two countries. In this connection I think we should bear in mind
                            that there was undoubtedly objection raised at home in various quarters
                            against the bringing in of Mexican labor; that various agencies of our
                            Government had to get themselves into accord before they could approach
                            the Department on the matter. It was not until these discussions had
                            taken place that the approach could be made by the Department through
                            this Embassy to the Mexican Government. It will be appreciated,
                            therefore, by the agencies at home concerned that the Mexican Government
                            has its similar problems to consider which from its point of view are as
                            important as those we had to consider. It has to be borne in mind that
                            there is considerable opinion in Mexico against labor being permitted to
                            move. I am sure, therefore, that the Department will appreciate, as I
                            do, that the action of the Mexican Government in examining this matter
                            so carefully is not through any lack of desire to cooperate.</p>
                        <p>I think the Department may therefore inform the appropriate agencies of
                            the Government in confidence of as much of the foregoing as it may deem
                            desirable, and in the meantime an effort may be made to find two, and I
                            believe a maximum of three, persons who can come to discuss this matter
                            between July 10 and 15 and who use Spanish. This will greatly facilitate
                            the conversations because in a matter of this kind the conversations
                            will have to take place directly between them and the officials of the
                            Mexican Government directly concerned. While the Embassy is prepared, of
                            course, to supply officers as interpreters, it is obvious from the
                            nature of the problem such direct conversations in Spanish will greatly
                            facilitate understanding and agreement.</p>
                        <p>I wish to emphasize the great importance of there being no publicity
                            whatever. There should be no publicity whatever to the fact <pb n="545"
                                xml:id="pg_545" facs="0559"/>that the Mexican Government is
                            considering this matter in a sympathetic light; that we may be
                            eventually sending these men here to talk about the matter, and that
                            negotiations are in progress. It will hamper the Mexican Government in
                            arriving at a satisfactory arrangement if there should be such
                            publicity. I realize that it may be difficult to avoid such publicity at
                            home, but it may be noted that the publicity there has been in this
                            matter has come from home. It will be in the interest of the agencies
                            which are concerned with this matter to see that the appropriate reserve
                            is maintained. I consider this essential to the successful negotiation
                            and carrying through of any arrangement. It is only until after an
                            agreement has been reached and appropriate understandings have been
                            reached as to the publicity to be given that there can be any discussion
                            in the press.</p>

                        <p>Subsequently, the Ambassador of Mexico presented a memorandum dated July
                            22, 1941 enclosing a memorandum and a draft of Water Treaty.<note n="72"

                        <p>Shortly thereafter the Department of State authorized the American

                        <p>The Department of State has given further consideration to these matters

                            water of the Colorado River to Mexico, delivered according to a monthly
                            schedule most convenient to the requirements of Mexico consistent with
                            releases and uses on the American side, the Department of State felt
                            that it had more than met the requirements of Mexico based upon that
                            country’s past claims since the quantity suggested of controlled water
                            would be so much more valuable than a much greater quantity of
                            uncontrolled water. It was noted with satisfaction that Mexico
                            recognized this to a certain extent by its counter proposal that
                            approximately 2,000,000 acre feet of water would be acceptable.</p>
                        <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>While it will be difficult to make arrangements therefor, the Department
                            of State, being desirous of obtaining the most satisfactory arrangements
                            practicable from the point of view of the two countries, suggests for
                            the consideration of the Mexican Government that, because of the great
                            value of controlled water and the very heavy expenditures made by the
                            United States in the erection of Boulder Dam and other storage
                            facilities, provision for the assured delivery to Mexico in perpetuity
                            according to a fixed monthly schedule of 1, 150,000 acre feet of
                            regulated and controlled water from the Colorado River Basin would
                            afford satisfactory adjustment of this aspect of the problem. It would
                            be understood that this quantity would represent the total assured
                            deliveries to Mexico from any source whatsoever of the Colorado River
                            Basin and its tributaries in the United States. It would also be
                            understood that any surplus waters that might reach Mexico over and
                            above the guaranteed amount would not establish any additional rights on
                            the part of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The Department has been gratified to learn, from recent oral statements
                            of the Ambassador of Mexico, that the Government of Mexico does not
                            insist upon the establishment of a new commission to administer the
                            contemplated water treaty, being prepared to entrust this function to
                            the International Boundary Commission, United States and Mexico.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>My Government has carefully considered the memorandum relative to
                            negotiations to conclude a Treaty on International Waters which was
                            handed to me by Mr. Duggan<note n="75" xml:id="d526fn75">Laurence
                                Duggan, Adviser on Political Relations.</note> on February 11,
                            1942.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Mexico is happy to recognize the good disposition of
                            the Government of the United States which has been shown by its
                            accepting, in general terms, the proposal which my aforesaid Government
                            submitted to the Department of State for consideration.</p>
                        <p>As I have on previous occasions taken the liberty of explaining, the
                            problem of the international waters and, in particular, that referring
                            to the Colorado River, has been the subject of prolonged studies on the
                            part of Mexican experts and on the basis thereof, my Government
                            instructs me to make certain comments on the memorandum of <pb n="549"
                                xml:id="pg_549" facs="0563"/>February 11 and, at the same time, to
                            insist on the points of view on which Mexico’s requests are based.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Amount of Water Needed by Mexico</hi>. The request
                            for a volume of 2,000,000 acre-feet annually is the minimum to satisfy
                            the foreseeable needs to a very near future. The latest studies of the
                            Mexican Section of the International Boundary Commission between Mexico
                            and the United States show that the furnishing of the indicated amount
                            of 2,000,000 acre-feet, which are indispensable for Mexican needs, would
                            not cause difficulties in the execution of present and future irrigation
                            programs in American territory.</p>
                        <p>The aforesaid volume of 2,000,000 acre-feet annually is the absolutely
                            necessary volume for the irrigation of 200,000 net hectares, which may
                            be cultivable, of the 300,000 good-class, gross hectares, subject to
                            gravity control in the Mexican section of the delta of the Colorado
                            River. The volume of 1, 150,000 acre-feet offered in the memorandum of
                            February 11 would be insufficient for the irrigation of a great area of
                            cultivable lands in the Colorado delta, lands which constitute the only
                            important agricultural zone in Lower California. It is well to add that,
                            in addition to the 200,000 net hectares to which I have just referred,
                            there is an area of approximately equal size, formed of good quality
                            lands, which could be watered by pumping if sufficient water from the
                            Colorado were available. There are also salt lands which could be washed
                            or improved if sufficient water were available. Despite these
                            considerations, the aforesaid possibilities had to be discarded in
                            formulating the plan in the terms in which it was presented to the
                            Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The offered volume of 1, 150,000 acre-feet would not, I repeat, suffice
                            to meet minimum needs. Acceptance of that volume would create in Lower
                            California a situation similar to that existing in the Juárez Valley in
                            which, as is well-known, the area of cultivable lands amounts to 17,000
                            hectares, of which only half are irrigated. The Government of Mexico
                            cannot agree that the permanently bad situation and the continual
                            international difficulties prevailing in the Juárez Valley should be
                            reproduced, with greater seriousness, in the Colorado zone, where the
                            area of lands to be irrigated is ten times greater than in that Valley
                            and the agricultural significance is of capital importance for all Lower
                            California.</p>
                        <p>From the studies made by the Mexican Section to which I referred above,
                            it is shown that the volume of the Colorado River amply provides for the
                            uses of both countries and, accordingly, an equitable division of the
                            waters would specify a minimum of 2,000,000 acrefeet for Mexico. Account
                            has been taken of future possibilities in both countries in setting this
                            figure.</p>
                        <p>In the conclusions reached by Engineer Adolfo Orive Alba as member of the
                            Mexican Section of the International Water Commission, <pb n="550"
                                xml:id="pg_550" facs="0564"/>in his “Hydrological Study of the
                            Colorado River”, it is stated that, in accordance with most recent
                            American data and taking into consideration the development, in the
                            United States, of all possible projects, Mexico could receive up to
                            2,300,000 acre-feet annually without any scarcity being felt in the
                            United States even in periods of drought which, apparently, are produced
                            by the climacteric regime of the region.</p>
                        <p>According to investigations made in 1930 by Mr. E. B. Debler, engineer of
                            the Reclamation Service—who made use of data of official origin in his
                            studies—the United States requires an annual average of 16,000,000
                            acre-feet to satisfy its needs in accordance with its foreseeable plans
                            in maximum development. This means a surplus of 2,400,000 acre-feet
                            annually, which amount could be allowed to Mexico without injury to its
                            northern neighbor.</p>
                        <p>A more recent estimate, published in 1939 in the “Engineering New
                            Record”, places American maximum needs at a lower figure than that
                            estimated by Engineer Debler. According to the said calculations, those
                            needs could be met with 14,200,000 acre-feet annually. If the
                            calculation is correct—and everything leads to the belief that this is
                            the case—the surplus would be sufficient not only to satisfy our
                            country’s demands but to constitute a margin of safety, in years of
                            scarcity, when the average flow of the Colorado drops from the
                            19,000,000 acrefeet which statistics consider as the regular flow and
                            which is what has been taken as the base of all studies on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that, on the basis of the data set forth, Mexico could
                            request, as equitable, a volume between 2,400,000 and 2,500,000
                            acre-feet, our petition is limited to 2,000,000, an amount indispensable
                            to satisfy the minimum needs of the region.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Procedure for Delivering the Water</hi>. The
                            American proposal to furnish the water controlled according to a fixed
                            table, cannot be accepted by Mexico since it would certainly mean a
                            repetition of the situation in the Juárez Valley, where practice has
                            shown that delivery made in such way gives rise to serious injuries,
                            both with respect to the crops and with respect to a large amount of
                            waste of water occasioned by the method of the fixed table. At present
                            it is not possible to foresee the crops, systems of labor and
                            fluctuations of climate which may occur within 50 or more years, but it
                            can be foreseen that, in the future, deliveries under a fixed table, if
                            accepted today, would cause future friction and difficulties which must
                            be here and now avoided. To this end, the Government of Mexico suggests
                            as being more practicable the delivery of the water according to an
                            annual table which the International Commission would determine, every
                            December, and which would govern during the following year.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Excess of Flow</hi>. With respect to volumes of
                            water which might reach Mexico in excess of the guaranteed amount, the
                            Mexican Government’s <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0565"/>point of
                            view differs from that of the United States in some aspects of practical
                            application, but it considers it preferable to defer the technical
                            discussion thereof that it may be undertaken when the two parties agree
                            on the basic part of the question, to conclude the friendly arrangement
                            which is desired.</p>

                            <p>As I had the honor of stating previously, the Mexican Government

                                States of America the powers and duties specified in the draft

                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador of Mexico and representatives of the Department of State
                            have had a number of conversations relating to various phases of the
                            contemplated international water treaty.</p>
                        <p>The conversations up to the present have dealt mainly with the question
                            of the allocation to Mexico of waters of the Colorado River. Without
                            prejudice to the question just mentioned or its present status, the
                            Department is desirous as soon as possible of undertaking conversations
                            relating to the allocation to the United States of waters of the Río
                                Bravo.<note n="76" xml:id="d527fn76">Rio Grande.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Mexican Government understands the approximate
                            needs of the United States. Properly to conserve the waters of the Rio
                            Grande below Fort Quitman for the benefit and use of both countries
                            requires storage and diversion works on the main stream located at such
                            points as will best satisfy the requirements for lands to be served. In
                            the lower area of the Rio Grande, the supply from the main Mexican
                            tributaries, the San Juan River with its Azucar Dam storage and the Río
                            Salado, can be best utilized by gravity canals on the Mexican side for
                            the development of the Mexican area. On the United States side, however,
                            storage and diversion should be upstream from these two tributaries and
                            the needs of the United States area can best be served from upstream
                            contributions. This explains the physical impossibility of attempting
                            the <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0566"/>equal sharing of the main
                            stream flow at given points in its course. To overcome these
                            difficulties it is proposed to allocate to each country’s ownership and
                            control definite amounts of flow for storage, diversion and in such a
                            manner as will produce the greatest flexibility and independence of use
                            in both nations.</p>
                        <p>To that end, it is proposed that a series of storage and diversion dams
                            be constructed on the main stream between Fort Quitman and the mouth of
                            the Río Salado, the latter being the lowest point for effective storage
                            for use of waters in the United States. Above points of international
                            storage the United States believes that there should be furnished from
                            Mexican sources a yearly average (to be determined over three-year
                            periods) of 1,000,000 acre feet of water for storage in the
                            international reservoirs and for diversion and use in the United States.
                            No less than 600,000 acre feet a year, however, should be supplied from
                            the designated tributaries. This amount (1,000,000 acre feet), plus the
                            United States’ contributions, would result in suitable allocation to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In order to permit more tributary control and development in, and by,
                            each country, the United States would be entitled to the sole use of all
                            contributions from its principal tributaries, and Mexico would retain
                            the contributions from its principal tributaries in excess of 1,000,000
                            acre feet a year. The principal tributaries should be measured, and
                            those to be measured should be specifically enumerated in the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>Increments reaching the main stream from all other sources (such as
                            springs, arroyo flows and other small tributaries difficult of
                            individual measurement) should be divided equally between the two
                            countries, except that where Mexico fails in any three-year period to
                            deliver the stipulated amount of water for American use, the deficiency
                            should be supplied from Mexico’s share of the unmeasured
                            contributions.</p>
                        <p>In order to make the water available for diversion and use on American
                            lands, Mexico’s annual deliveries of 1,000,000 acre feet should be from
                            tributaries discharging into the main stream above the lowest point of
                            international storage. Water in the river below this point should be
                            divided equally between the two countries. Each nation should maintain
                            at its own expense proper gaging stations on the designated tributaries
                            at or near the points where they discharge into the river, in order that
                            proper credit may be given for the respective contributions. Gaging
                            stations should be jointly maintained on the main river at suitable
                            locations, in order to determine the increments from sources other than
                            measured tributaries. Water passing Fort Quitman, Texas, should be
                            deemed to be a United States tributary contribution.</p>
                        <p>Provision should be made for the taking of an annual accounting <pb
                                n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0567"/>of the water in each reservoir,
                            in order to determine the quantity to the credit of each nation. Losses
                            from evaporation and waste should be charged to each nation in
                            proportion to the amount in storage to the credit of each nation.</p>
                        <p>Each country should be given the right to use the bed of the river to
                            carry water allocated to it or released from storage for its
                            benefit.</p>
                        <p>The number, approximate locations and capacities of the international
                            storage and diversion dams should be agreed upon in the treaty, subject
                            to variations with the consent of both Commissioners. The costs should
                            be prorated between the two countries by the Commissioners in proportion
                            to the benefits each country will receive by reason of their
                            construction, taking into account their utility both for flood control
                            and irrigation purposes.</p>

                                Mexico declares forthwith its full willingness to study and settle,
                                jointly with the Government of the United States, the problems
                                presented by the distribution and utilization of the said waters at
                                the same time that the conversations initiated with regard to the
                                Colorado River are carried on.</p>
                            <p>It is well to point out that a simultaneous consideration of all
                                aspects of the best utilization of the Rio Bravo and the Colorado
                                establishes a solid basis for arriving within the near future at an
                                understanding between the two countries which will definitively
                                solve this complex matter. It is possible to forecast a satisfactory
                                result in view of the fact that, in addition, the conversations
                                between the two Chancelries are guided by a sincere wish to obtain
                                the best complete utilization of the international streams to the
                                benefit of the two countries and a distribution of their waters in a
                                way adequate to the present and future necessities of each of them
                                and in a manner which will entirely prevent or will proportionately
                                and fairly divide the damages resulting from an insufficiency of the
                                volume of the rivers.</p>
                            <p>From a careful reading of the aforesaid memorandum of March 27, the
                                Government of Mexico has become convinced that the two Governments
                                are entirely in agreement with respect to the greater part of the
                                points to which the said document refers and that these, certainly,
                                are the fundamental aspects of the problem of the distribution of
                                the waters of the Rio Bravo between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>In fact, it is well known that in order properly to conserve the
                                waters of the aforesaid river, to the advantage and for the use of
                                both countries, constructions for storage and to draw off water are
                                required on the principal stream at those points where a
                                satisfaction of the needs of the lands which must be irrigated is
                                best to be achieved, and that attention must be given both to the
                                requirements of the American bank, which needs hydraulic works
                                upstream from the confluence of the Rio Bravo and the Salado River,
                                and to the requirements of Mexican lands, which need storage and
                                run-off constructions a little below the confluence mentioned. Only,
                                it is necessary to add, to this point of agreement, that all the
                                works—whether they directly benefit the United States or whether
                                they redound preponderantly to Mexico’s advantage—must form a
                                coherent whole which will bring benefits to both countries, since
                                together they will serve to store and handle efficiently the volume
                                of the river’s flow, a result which it would not be possible to
                                achieve with any one of the works individually.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that the number, approximate location and capacity of
                                the international storage and run-off dams must be agreed upon in
                                the Treaty, these points being subject to the variations which are
                                decided upon, by common agreement, by the two Commissioners. It is
                                also considered just and equitable that the costs should be prorated

                                    n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0569"/>each of them will receive
                                from the construction of the works, account being taken of the
                                utility thereof, both from the point of view of defense against
                                floods, and from that of irrigation.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico concurs with that of the United States of
                                America in considering that the physical character of the Rio Bravo
                                valley prevents a distribution by equal parts of the principal
                                stream at specified points of its channel (although it does insist
                                on a total distribution in equal parts of the general flow which the
                                said principal channel carries and conducts). Accordingly, it is
                                considered advisable that the volume assigned to each country be its
                                property and under its control in each of the international storage
                                dams, that the countries may thence run them off in the most
                                advantageous manner and the greatest flexibility and independence in
                                the uses effected by each be achieved.</p>
                            <p>The above agreement implies a common opinion as to the right to use
                                the channel of the river to transport the water assigned to each
                                country from the storage receptacles to the points of intake or
                                run-off most convenient to the riparian users. In addition, as
                                stated in the Department of State’s memorandum under reference, the
                                system requires an efficient appraisal service and the necessity of
                                keeping an account of the water in each storage receptacle, to the
                                end that the amount to be accredited to each country may be
                                determined, losses by evaporation and waste being charged in
                                proportion to the amount stored which has been credited to each
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Among those most important general points—on which the existing
                                agreement between the two Governments establishes an adequate system
                                for the best utilization and distribution of the waters of the Rio
                                Bravo—there is only one important discrepancy, with certain
                                incidentals, concerning which a fair arrangement can be reached.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States proposed that certain Mexican
                                affluents of the Rio Bravo furnish a volume of one million acre-feet
                                annually for the exclusive use of the American bank. This
                                contribution should be liquidated and completed in cycles of three
                                years. It considers that, with such volume, plus the total
                                contribution of the American affluents and fifty per cent of the
                                flow of the principal channel (not coming from evaluated affluents),
                                the United States would have its needs met.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico regrets that it is unable to accede to the
                                American proposal in consideration of the fact that the volume of
                                the Mexican affluents assigned to meeting the aforesaid allotment is
                                so low that in dry years Mexico would not be able to comply with its
                                obligation without decreasing uses already existing in the valleys
                                of these affluents. Furthermore, a series of dry years would leave
                                Mexico, when it made the triennial liquidation, with a debt which it
                                would be very difficult to redeem in the future. In order to obtain
                                    <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0570"/>a complete
                                regularization of the current of those affluents, the Government of
                                Mexico would need to construct very expensive works which are out of
                                proportion to the utility which would be obtained from them. In view
                                of the foregoing, it does not seem fair for Mexico alone to endure
                                the injuries resulting from lack of precipitation. Nor does it seem
                                fair that, in order to meet such certain contingencies, the valleys
                                of such affluents should be deprived not only of any future
                                development, but even of their present uses.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico, in exchange, proposes a distribution by
                                equal parts of the general flow of the Rio Bravo, and—as the Mexican
                                affluents furnish this general flow with more than double the volume
                                coming from American tributaries—it is obvious that, in the fifty
                                per cent corresponding to the United States of America there are
                                included: <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) all contributions by American
                                affluents; <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) fifty per cent of the flow
                                coming from non-evaluated, transitory and small sources; and <hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) a little more than a fourth of the total
                                flow which reaches the Rio Bravo from Mexican affluents.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, in abundant and in normal years, the amount thus formed
                                will be equal to or greater than that desired by the Government of
                                the United States of America and only in dry years will it be less;
                                but it will be less in the same proportion as Mexico has the water
                                corresponding to it reduced. With this procedure, the two countries
                                will feel the injuries resulting from droughts fairly and
                                proportionately. Furthermore, the international storage dams on the
                                channel of the Rio Bravo will be able to regularize the utilization
                                of the river for the purpose of meeting the deficiencies in the dry
                                years, provided that a great many consecutive periods of drought do
                                not occur.</p>
                            <p>The proposal of the Government of Mexico is based on the fact that
                                available studies indicate that present uses and possible future
                                uses in the valley of Mexican and American affluents will not be
                                able completely to exhaust such streams and, accordingly, there will
                                always be a remainder which, united to waters from freshets,
                                returns, etc., which will be stored in the international dams, will
                                be sufficient to furnish water at the run-offs made in those
                                international works to meet the needs of both banks. Under the
                                foregoing conditions, the amount corresponding to American riparian
                                lands will be approximately what the Government of the United States
                                of America seeks in proposing a fixed quota, furnished by the
                                Mexican affluents.</p>
                            <p>The said proposal may be supplemented by the possibility that, upon
                                the approval of the two countries, each of them may consume in a
                                specified stretch of the river or at a certain storage dam or group
                                of dams a greater volume than corresponds to it, provided that the
                                difference in excess will be made up to the other country in another
                                stretch or in one or more other dams.</p>
                            <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0571"/>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Government of the United States
                                of America should not consider that the flow of the principal
                                channel of the Rio Bravo and its affluents is sufficiently great for
                                the United States to obtain a volume equitably adequate to its needs
                                through a distribution of the total waters by halves, or if it
                                considers that the uses of the affluents may in the future sensibly
                                diminish the volume received by virtue of the distribution by
                                halves, the Government of Mexico agrees that, when the proposed
                                Treaty is signed, the corresponding Commissioners may be authorized
                                to make a joint hydrological study which will include in its
                                entirety the principal stream of the Rio Bravo and that of its
                                affluents for the purpose of establishing regulations to the effect
                                that available waters be distributed in proportion to the legitimate
                                needs which exist or may exist in the two countries.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the Government of Mexico begs to draw the attention of the
                                Department of State to the present situation in the Juárez Valley.
                                To begin with, the Government of Mexico does not feel that there is
                                any reason or ground for considering the Juárez–Cajoncitos section
                                of the Rio Bravo as a mere water-conveying canal or an American
                                affluent, inasmuch as the said section has not lost its character of
                                an international river boundary. In addition, the table of water
                                delivery to Mexico is contrary to the meteorological and agronomical
                                characteristics of the present time in the aforsesaid Juárez Valley
                                and the volume of water actually utilizable from the channel which
                                the United States of America delivers at the Acequia Madre in Ciudad
                                Juárez has in reality decreased through the increase in the
                                alkalinity of the water. The Government of Mexico hopes to receive
                                from the Government of the United States of America a friendly and
                                equitable understanding of these partial problems presented by the
                                utilization of the Rio Bravo, for the purpose of obtaining a final
                                and adequate solution of this question in its entirety.</p>
                            <p>A brief technical exposition which gives the bases for the proposals
                                contained in this memorandum is attached.<note n="78"

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called at Mr. Duggan’s request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan stated that the Department had been giving continued attention
                            to the question of allocation of Colorado River waters and that, in
                            addition to various studies which had been made, representatives of the
                            Department had attended two meetings in El Paso of the Committees of the
                            Colorado River Basin States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan then said that during the past few days very long conferences
                            had been held here in which Mr. Lawson and several representatives of
                            the Basin had participated. Mr. Duggan said that despite all the data
                            which had been assembled it still appeared that we were not quite in a
                            position to resume discussions with the Ambassador at this end without
                            obtaining some further technical information and for this reason he
                            suggested a meeting at El Paso on August 31 to be attended by the
                            American and Mexican Boundary Commissioners, one or two representatives
                            of the Basin States and such technical experts as the Mexican Government
                            might designate. It is desired that at this meeting there be a factual
                            exploration of the places where Mexico would want water delivered in
                            order that our engineers might be able to determine where canals, dams
                            and other structures would be necessary and other technical aspects be
                            explored informally.</p>
                        <p>This proposal seemed satisfactory to the Ambassador who stated he would
                            communicate with his Government promptly and inform us of its
                            decision.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bursley</hi>: The Mexican Ambassador telephoned
                            me late yesterday afternoon to state that the Mexican Government
                            accepted with pleasure the proposal for a meeting of technicians on
                            international waters in El Paso on August 31. Señor MacGregor, the
                            Mexican commissioner, has been instructed to attend. He will be assisted
                            by certain technicians.</p>
                        <p>I expressed my gratification at the Ambassador’s rapid action in securing
                            the approval of the Mexican Government to our proposal.</p>
                        <p>I did not press the Ambassador with respect to whether anyone from the
                            Mexican Foreign Office would attend. I suggest that Mr. Lawson upon his
                            return endeavor to ascertain this from Señor Mac-Gregor. If there will
                            be representatives from the Mexican Foreign Office, then we can consider
                            sending someone down from here.</p>

                        <p>At Mr. Duggan’s request the Mexican Ambassador called at Mr. Duggan’s
                            office to receive an informal confidential memorandum<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d532fn79">
                                <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> in reply to Mexico’s memorandum
                            of March 19, 1942 in which it was contended that 2,000,000 acre-feet of
                            water would be available for Mexico from the Colorado River even after
                            full development in the United States.</p>
                        <p>By way of preliminary explanation Mr. Duggan said that a careful study of
                            the Mexican contention had been made for the past six months and that,
                            in consequence, he could state positively that 2,000,000 acre-feet would
                            not normally be available for Mexico after full development in the Basin
                            States. The present memorandum, which he then handed to the Ambassador,
                            contains data, he said, to sustain this conclusion.</p>
                        <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0574"/>
                        <p>After reading the memorandum the Ambassador said he would be glad to
                            refer the matter to the appropriate officials. Mr. Duggan stated that
                            the difference between the amount claimed by Mexico and the amount
                            tentatively offered by the Department (1, 150,000) was nearly 1,000,000
                            acre-feet and that it was simply unthinkable that the United States
                            Senate would approve a treaty providing an allocation anywhere near the
                            Mexican figure. He also called attention to the clearly established fact
                            that the Colorado system does not provide enough water for the irrigable
                            lands of both countries; furthermore, he noted that other considerations
                            of great value to Mexico would go far to enable Mexico to make the
                            greatest possible beneficial use of every available acre-foot of water.
                            Both Mr. Duggan and Dr. Timm emphasized the greater value of controlled,
                            scheduled water as compared with natural flow.</p>
                        <p>In reply to these statements the Ambassador admitted that controlled
                            water had greater value than natural flow, but he said that control did
                            not add enough value to make 1, 150,000 acre-feet equivalent to Mexico’s
                            just share of the water supply. He added, however, that the data
                            contained in the present memorandum might, if it were made available to
                            him, be quite useful to the Mexican Boundary Commissioner, Señor Ing.
                            Rafael Fernández MacGregor. Mr. Duggan then stated that additional
                            studies were being made of the water supply of the Colorado and of the
                            relative value of controlled water as compared with natural flow. He
                            expressed the hope that as a result of these studies it would be
                            possible to make more rapid progress in the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation Mr. Duggan took occasion to say that
                            Dr. Timm had been added to the staff of the Department of State with the
                            immediate task of making a special study of the water problem existing
                            between the United States and Mexico. He also mentioned that he, Mr. L.
                            M. Lawson, American Boundary Commissioner, and Dr. Timm had recently
                            held conferences with representatives of the Basin States on the subject
                            of the proposed water treaty and that while they (Duggan and Timm) were
                            in El Paso they had had the pleasure of paying a brief visit,
                            accompanied by Mr. Lawson, to the office of the Mexican Section of the
                            Boundary Commission, where they had been most courteously received by
                            the Mexican Commissioner.</p>

                        <p>The memorandum of the Ambassador of Mexico, dated March 19, 1942, has had
                            careful consideration. Pending the completion of still further studies
                            being pursued with the purpose of ascertaining in the near future
                            whether alternate formulas may be developed, the following observations
                            are made.</p>
                        <p>The proposal of the United States for the delivery of Colorado River
                            water to Mexico was predicated upon the confirmation and protection of
                            uses in Mexico existing prior to the completion of Boulder Dam, based
                            upon the unregulated flow of the river, and also upon a recognition of
                            the rights of the seven Colorado River Basin States in the United
                            States, as evidenced primarily by the Colorado River Compact among the
                                States.<note n="81" xml:id="d533fn81">The Colorado River Compact
                                assigned 7,500,000 acre-feet per year to the Upper Basin and the
                                same amount to the Lower Basin, with the right, however, to increase
                                this amount by 1,000,000 acre-feet per year.</note> The United
                            States has recognized this Compact in the Act of Congress known as the
                            Boulder Canyon Project Act.<note n="82" xml:id="d533fn82">Approved
                                December 21, 1928; 45 Stat. 1057.</note> The Compact referred to
                            made a primary allocation for consumptive use within the seven basin
                            States.</p>
                        <p>This initial allocation of 16,000,000 acre-feet does not represent the
                            maximum quantity which can be put to beneficial use in the United
                            States. It was based, rather, upon what was then considered a firm
                            annual supply, leaving to the future the disposition, among the States,
                            of any additional quantities which might then be found to exist. An
                            exhaustive survey, designed to determine the extent to which the water
                            of the Colorado River may be beneficially used in the United States, and
                            the available supply, is now in progress by agencies of the United
                            States Government. This survey, however, may not be completed for
                            several years.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the best data presently available, the total virgin flow of
                            the river is estimated at 18,000,000 acre-feet per annum on the average,
                            leaving an estimated average quantity of 2,000,000 acre-feet per year to
                            take care of reservoir losses and for future allocations in the United
                            States. This water can all be beneficially used in the United States.
                            Projects in operation and under construction in the <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0576"/>lower basin of the United States at the
                            present time will use 9, 140,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water per
                            year. This is 640,000 acre-feet more than the firm allocations of the
                            Colorado River Compact to the lower Basin States. These projects do not
                            comprehend the total possibilities of the lower basin.</p>
                        <p>In addition it must be borne in mind that we are here dealing with
                            average figures which do not take into account extended periods of low
                            run-off such as have been recently experienced, where American
                            developments would necessarily be deprived of sufficient water if any
                            substantial amount was guaranteed to Mexico. It is quite possible that
                            in years of abnormal run-off 2,000,000 acre-feet of water or more could
                            be delivered to Mexico without deprivation to lands in the United
                            States, even after ultimate developments in the United States. In the
                            average year, however, the amount that could be so delivered would be
                            very much less than this figure, and during dry cycles much less than
                            1,000,000 acre-feet would be available without serious deprivation to
                            American interests.</p>
                        <p>Mexico’s estimates of the water supply and that amount which will be
                            available for ultimate use were undoubtedly based on early figures which
                            have been shown by later surveys to be inaccurate. When the Colorado
                            River Compact was negotiated in 1922 it was assumed that total water
                            production in the basin was about 19,000,000 acre-feet. Sixteen million
                            acre-feet were allocated by the Compact. Subsequent stream flow records
                            have indicated that the 1922 estimate was too high. In this connection
                            it is of interest to note that as gauging facilities have been improved,
                            the estimates of virgin flow of the river have tended to decline, so
                            much so as to place in some doubt the present estimate of 18,000,000
                            acre-feet. The total water production of the basin, including the Gila
                            River, during the low run-off period, 1930–1940, averaged only about
                            14,500,000 acre-feet per year, or 1,500,000 acre-feet per year short of
                            the Compact allocations. If such a 10-year cycle occurred at the end of
                            the 50-year amortization period provided for Boulder Dam and appurtenant
                            facilities, it is estimated that the release from Lake Mead would be
                            only about 8,500,000 acre-feet per year and this would be made possible
                            only by drawing the contents of the reservoir down 17,000,000 acre-feet
                            during the 10 year period.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, no account has apparently been taken in the data cited in
                            the Ambassador’s memorandum of March 19, of reservoir evaporation
                            losses, which are estimated as being in excess of 1,000,000 acre-feet
                            annually, thus materially reducing the amount of water available for
                            distribution, either to the United States or to Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Existing projects below the dam will require 7,800,000 acre-feet of this
                            annual release of 8,500,000 acre-feet without taking into consideration
                                <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0577"/>additional units of
                            projects already planned. In fact, studies of releases at Boulder Dam
                            corresponding to the period 1930–1940, inclusive, show that in only
                            three out of eleven years would Mexico have been supplied with the
                            requested amount of 2,000,000 acre-feet after supplying the lower Basin
                            projects under construction. Even this indicated surplus would diminish
                            as future contemplated construction in the United States was realized.
                            It is thus apparent that any waters allocated to Mexico over and above
                            return waters present in the river at the international boundary must
                            operate to restrict proportionately the ultimate development within the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In the ten-year period prior to 1935, when Boulder Dam was placed in
                            operation, the average area cultivated in Mexico was 152,000 acres. If
                            the diversion duty is taken as 4.5 acre-feet per acre per annum the
                            corresponding use of water would have been 684,000 acre-feet. The year
                            of maximum use during this period was 1925, when 217,000 acres were
                            cultivated. Expanded uses in Mexico since 1935 were due to, and made
                            possible by, the construction of Boulder Dam and its appurtenant works,
                            thus controlling and regulating the theretofore erratic flow of the
                            stream. It should not be over-looked that actual water shortages
                            occurred on several occasions between 1920 and 1935, hence the Mexican
                            computations regarding surplus water must refer to the situation created
                            by that Dam. This is a factor that cannot be ignored in determining the
                            beneficial uses to which Mexico has established a right and precludes
                            the use of the period subsequent to 1935 in making this
                            determination.</p>
                        <p>The quantity that was proposed to be delivered to Mexico by the United
                            States, therefore, is more than sufficient to provide for the maximum
                            area which Mexico had cultivated prior to the construction of Boulder
                            Dam, particularly considering the fact that the delivery was to be a
                            controlled one, subject to agreed schedules. That ultimate uses in the
                            United States will not always leave 2,000,000 acre-feet for Mexico was
                            virtually admitted in the memorandum of July 22, 1941 of the Ambassador
                            of Mexico;<note n="83" xml:id="d533fn83">Not printed.</note> for therein
                            it was stated that “the volume determined (2,000,000 acre-feet) will
                            normally constitute a surplus from the American uses”. It will be
                            recognized at once that no developmental program could safely be based
                            upon a stated amount of water when that supply is only normal or
                            average. Furthermore, as has been shown above, it would be only in years
                            of abnormally high run-off that 2,000,000 acre-feet could be delivered
                            to Mexico after full development in the United States.</p>

                                L. Hernndez, Mexican Foreign Office water and boundary
                                expert.</note> they laid great stress on importance to the two
                            countries of prompt resolution of the international water problem with
                            particular reference to the example it would set to the world.</p>
                        <p>They advanced the idea that Mexico would not insist upon a guarantee of a
                            minimum amount of water annually if this would facilitate the
                            Department’s negotiations with the Basin States. They stated, however,
                            that this would be conditioned upon the adoption of a strict percentage
                            basis for the allocation of waters, also without any maximum limitation.
                            They said they thought that any deliveries in excess of 2 million acre
                            feet under this arrangement would probably consist only of water which
                            could not be used in the United States otherwise than on a transitory
                            basis. In very tentative way they suggested 12½ percent for Mexico of
                            discharges from Boulder Dam stating also that in dry years it would be
                            very expensive and difficult for the United States to live up to any
                            minimum quantitative guarantee.</p>
                        <p>Fernández MacGregor is here for two purposes, one, to assist in drafting
                            of reply to Department’s latest memorandum<note n="87" xml:id="d534fn87"
                                >Apparently reference is to the memorandum handed to the Mexican
                                Ambassador by Mr. Duggan on November 4, 1942, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >supra</hi>.</note> and, two, with a thought that Lawson might
                            be brought here for definitive conversations.</p>
                        <p>I think I shall be able to manage at least to go over with the Mexican
                            officials their draft of reply.</p>
                        <p>Although I had not yet received your letter of December 8 I gave no
                            encouragement to the idea of having any definitive negotiations here at
                            this time pointing out (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the Department
                            was doing all that it could to reach a satisfactory arrangement with the
                            Basin States which would have some chance of prospering in treaty form
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that since this question from its
                            inception had been handled by the United States and Mexican authorities
                            in the United States it seemed better to continue that procedure. I made
                            it clear, however, that I would be available at any time for friendly
                            and informal conversations.</p>
                        <p>I again sought to convey desirability of some recession by Mexico from 2
                            million demand with object of facilitating negotiations with the basin
                            people.</p>
                        <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>It was perfectly clear to the Mexican officials that I had absolutely no
                            instructions and except for a desire to be cooperative had no desire to
                            take over any functions which did not appertain to me.</p>
                        <p>All of these conversations have been on a very cordial basis but without

                            Embassy appreciate the desire of the Mexican Government to expedite an
                            agreement but the studies and negotiations now proceeding in the United

                            practicable. I shall also like to be able to say that while Lawson will

                            Department would prefer to continue along present lines of procedure at

                            in Managua for a few days and plans to return in about 3 weeks. He
                            agrees with the Legation that before progress can be made in improving
                            methods of processing wild rubber, arrangements must be made for the
                            purchase of the product. There has been no organized system for selling
                            the rubber which is already warehoused here to the United States
                            although some sales have been made to Mexico and Guatemala. Will the
                            Rubber Reserve Company make an immediate offer for the rubber already
                            stored and to buy future Nicaraguan production at a fixed price?</p>
                        <p>Seeley joins the Legation in recommending that an agreement be negotiated
                            with the Nicaraguan Government providing for the export control of
                            rubber and the sale of all Nicaraguan production to the United States at
                            a price to be agreed upon, all such rubber to be handled by the trading
                            subsidiary of the National Bank, as recommended in the Legation’s
                            despatch no. 521 of April 13.<note n="1" xml:id="d535fn3">Not

                            or for whatever period is necessary in order to visit the various rubber
                            producing regions and to stimulate the production of wild rubber. There
                            is no use embarking on the latter program until there is some indication
                            of a market and an acceptable price for the rubber when produced; since
                            it appears that Nicaragua can produce several times as much rubber as it
                            normally consumes, such efforts would seem to be fully warranted.</p>
                        <p>The Legation urgently recommends that someone be sent to Nicaragua
                            immediately to determine the amount of rubber now available <pb n="567"

                            immediately upon his return 3 weeks hence?</p>

                        <p>193. Your 174 of April 23. On May 2, 1942 agreements were signed by
                            Rubber Reserve Company and Bank of Nicaragua, subject to ratification by
                            Directors of Bank of Nicaragua, whereby Bank of Nicaragua agreed to
                            cause entire Nicaraguan production to be sold to Rubber Reserve, other
                            than amount required for local consumption. This amount was fixed at 50
                            tons subject to adjustment if essential needs are found to be in excess
                            of 50 tons. The price to be paid is 330 per pound f.o.b. Nicaraguan
                            ocean ports for usual good quality Nicaraguan scrap of the castilloa
                            type with appropriate differentials for other types and grades. In
                            addition, premium payments of 2½¢ per pound for rubber purchased between
                            200 tons and 700 tons and of 5¢ per pound for rubber purchased over 700
                            tons during any one year are to be paid to the Bank and made available
                            to the Government for financing immediate expansion of production and
                            improvement of quality of wild rubber in Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>Under the agreements, the Bank agrees to cause itself to be established
                            as agency to acquire and sell crude rubber produced in Nicaragua, except
                            that Rubber Reserve may buy rubber for its own account if such purchases
                            do not interfere with the Bank’s operations.</p>
                        <p>The Bank agrees to establish the base price to Rubber Reserve as the
                            price of rubber for domestic consumption or use.</p>
                        <p>The Bank agreed to restrict to the United States the export of crude

                            vital problems of my country which could be solved by cooperation of the
                            United States of America, I referred especially to the imperious need of
                            connecting the densely populated districts on the Pacific Coast with the
                            extensive and rich zone on the Atlantic Coast, as the only medium to
                            effectively nationalize and incorporate politically and judicially, that
                            section of the nation which in reality, continues to be a social group
                            with different language, religion and customs, from the rest of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Because of this grave problem of lack of national unity there have
                            originated separatistic movements on the Atlantic Coast, formerly
                            occupied by England, and which has frequently been the focal center of
                            revolutionary movements; the Government of Nicaragua tried with more or
                            less success to inculcate an effective cultural and spiritual
                            incorporation of this extensive and important territory, always meeting
                            insuperable obstacles on account of the lack of permanent means of
                            communication. For this same reason, the national progress of the
                            country suffered great losses, as the rich forestal, mining and
                            agricultural resources of that privileged part of our country, lacked
                            commercial connection with the maritime traffic on the Atlantic Coast,
                            so necessary to develop a safe and stable basis for commercial relations
                            with the United States of America. For this same reason I stated to you
                            in my letter of May 22nd, 1939,<note n="6" xml:id="d537fn6">

                            Government considered it of capital importance, for the development of
                            the production and the commerce of our country, to unite that productive
                            region on the Atlantic Coast, with the zones densely populated on the
                            Pacific Coast, by a more direct road of commercial communication between
                            Nicaragua and the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>Facing such a grave situation and trusting in your good will and high
                            spirit of justice which animates you, I permitted myself, at that time,
                            to suggest the canalization of the San Juan River,<note n="7"

                            the aforementioned treaty. My hopes were not in vain, as you Sir, gave
                            all attention and acceptance to my suggestions, and gave impetus to this
                            by sending American Army Engineers to make the necessary preliminary
                            studies, before starting the actual work.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the progress of the realization of the task of the
                            canalization of the San Juan River, and your loyal and noble intention
                            to finish this work, encountered obstacles by the present war, which has
                            been provoked by ambition, hatred and the spirit of destruction of moral
                            and material values, which Mankind conquered only after centuries of
                            long patient labor. A war which treacherously hurt the noble American
                            people, which [<hi rend="italic">with</hi>] whom my people and I are
                            solidly united by the ideal of democracy, which you with great courage
                            and frankness sustain in this world, hoping for the redemption of
                            oppressed nations and justice for the future of Humanity.</p>
                        <p>In this condition, Nicaragua, deprived of the fluvial route to the
                            Atlantic Coast, and confronted by the acute problem of the isolation of
                            that region, I consider the only solution to be the obtaining, of any
                            rapid or permanent means of communication, which connects the Atlantic
                            with the Pacific Coast.</p>
                        <p>With this object in view, my Government proposes the construction in the
                            shortest possible time, of a first class highway, starting from San
                            Benito on the Pan American Highway and terminating at El Bluff, port on
                            the Atlantic Coast, conditioned to receive vessels of deep draught. On
                            this highway intense work is already going on and large sums of money
                            have been spent in the preparation of bridges and opening of the jungle.
                            This highway, aside from being of great economic, political and social
                            value, is also of great strategic importance for the Continental
                            defense, Nicaragua, and also for the defense of the Panama Canal. With
                            this work Nicaragua will contribute a valuable cooperation and
                            assistance to the common task to end that drama which the world faces in
                            these trying days.</p>
                        <p>But Sir, as my country lacks the sufficient resources to finish the work
                            on this highway, and always trusting in the high spirit of justice and
                            the good will which you have demonstrated in respect to Nicaragua and
                            the Government over which I preside, I permit myself to propose a
                            collaboration on the part of the United States of America, to supply the
                            funds or resources so necessary for the construction of the
                            aforementioned highway to the Atlantic, in substitution of the projected
                            work of the canalization of the San Juan River. These funds or
                            resources, will be credited to Nicaragua by the United States of
                            America, following the same procedure as that of the projected <pb
                                n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0584"/>work of canalization stipulated
                            by the Bryan–Chamorro Canal Convention.</p>
                        <p>It is understood, that in respect to this highway of twofold importance,
                            commercial and strategic, the Government of Nicaragua is willing to
                            include in the agreement or agreements to be signed, all those
                            stipulations that both countries consider convenient, in order to obtain
                            from this highway, the benefits of military defense.</p>
                        <p>My Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Mariano Argüello Vargas, who will
                            present this letter, carries my personal representation and also that of
                            my Government, to initiate and terminate, any agreement which tends to
                            the realization of this important work which I have permitted myself to
                            propose to you. Consequently, I request you to give credit to all
                            proposals made by him with respect to this and other matters, in his
                            special mission before your illustrious Government.</p>

                            to forward to you the War Department’s opinion as to the desirability,

                            during President Somoza’s visit to Washington in May of 1939 you had an
                            opportunity <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0585"/>of discussing with

                            canalization of the San Juan River for vessels of moderate draft”. In
                            your reply you pointed to the fact that “should occasion arise, the
                            existence of such a water way would have a very important bearing upon
                            the defense of the hemisphere” and stated that on the basis of the
                            reports of the survey, “we can take such further action as seems in the
                            common interest of our two countries”.</p>
                        <p>The surveys of the barge or light draft canal project led to the
                            conclusion that the benefits to be derived would not be commensurate
                            with the cost, which was estimated at about $30,000,000. However,
                            President Somoza feels that this Government made a commitment to
                            cooperate in a practical manner in the establishment of communication
                            between the two sections of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>It now appears that in the opinion both of the Nicaraguan Government and
                            of the Department, the cooperation in question can best be rendered
                            through the construction of a road which, branching off from the
                            Inter-American Highway at a point known as San Benito, about twenty-two
                            miles north of Managua, would proceed in an easterly direction to the
                            river port of Rama, on the Escondido River. The distance from San Benito
                            to Rama is about one hundred and fifty miles.</p>
                        <p>From Rama to El Bluff on the Atlantic Ocean, there is a distance of sixty
                            miles which is navigable for vessels with less than twelve feet draught,
                            so that barge communication is entirely feasible. Eventually it will
                            probably be desirable to construct a road from Rama to El Bluff, but the
                            exact factors involved are as yet unknown, since no detailed survey has
                            been made.</p>
                        <p>I have taken this matter up with the War Department, with a view to
                            ascertaining the utility of this road proposal in relation to hemisphere
                            defense. There is enclosed herewith a copy of a letter dated April 2,
                                1942,<note n="12" xml:id="d539fn12">

                            Major General Eisenhower, the substance of which is that the proposed
                            road between Rama and San Benito would have a very definite military
                            value.</p>

                            emergency fund for the following purposes: <list>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: It was a great pleasure
                            to receive from the hands of your distinguished Foreign Minister, Dr.
                            Mariano Argüello, your two good letters of February 26 and February
                                28<note n="15" xml:id="d540fn15">Letter of February 26 not
                                printed.</note> in which you describe certain problems with which
                            your Government is currently faced. First of all, let me express to you
                            my appreciation of the opportunity which you have afforded me and the
                            officials of my Government directly concerned to talk over these matters
                            with so competent and understanding a person as Dr. Argüello. His
                            mission has, in my opinion, been highly successful.</p>
                        <p>The two principal matters dealt with in your letters are as follows: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The importation of necessary materials and equipment for the
                                    Nicaraguan gold mines; and</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The construction of a highway joining the Pacific and Atlantic
                                    sections of Nicaragua.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am happy to say that both of these problems appear to have been
                            satisfactorily disposed of.</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0587"/>
                        <p>With reference to the first of them, it has been agreed by the War
                            Production Board that the Nicaraguan gold mining industry will continue
                            to receive sufficient equipment and materials, so far as these are
                            available in the United States, to continue operations at normal levels.
                            This decision reflects the importance of this industry to the Nicaraguan
                            economy and the desire of the Government of the United States to
                            cooperate to the fullest degree possible in the maintenance of that
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the road question, the Acting Secretary of State has just
                            had the pleasure of signing with Dr. Argüello an exchange of notes<note
                                n="16" xml:id="d540fn16">Notes exchanged were dated April 8 and 18;
                                see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> in accordance with which my
                            Government will, at its expense, construct a paved road from San Benito
                            to Rama, and will survey the route for a road from Rama to El Bluff in
                            order that your Government may be in a position to reach a decision as
                            to the feasibility and desirability of its undertaking the construction
                            of such a road. This exchange of notes envisages a practical and
                            complete solution of the problem which we discussed in May of 1939 and
                            which has since been the subject of careful consideration by the
                            appropriate authorities of my Government. With the completion of the
                            Rama-San Benito road, I am confident you will agree with me that we may
                            both feel that our efforts have been successful and that an objective
                            which we have both long viewed as being to the very great advantage both
                            of Nicaragua and of the United States, and of great interest from the
                            point of view of hemisphere defense, has been attained in a completely
                            satisfactory manner.</p>
                        <p>I have also been informed that through an exchange of notes the necessary
                            details for the cooperative completion of the Inter-American Highway
                            through Nicaragua have been agreed to. I believe that the work on these
                            two highway projects will be of the greatest value in promoting the
                            economic well-being of Nicaragua and that upon their completion new
                            sources of wealth and commerce will be opened up to the active
                            enterprise of the industrious and forwardlooking people of your
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It gives me pleasure also at this time very particularly to express my
                            appreciation to you and to your fellow citizens for the wholehearted
                            cooperation and the enthusiastic support which you have unstintedly
                            afforded to the people and to the Government of the United States in the
                            struggle in which we are engaged side by side.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: With reference to conversations
                            which Your Excellency has held with officials of this Government and to
                            conversations held by His Excellency President Somoza during his visit
                            to Washington in 1939, I have the honor to inform you that careful and
                            sympathetic consideration has been given by the appropriate officials of
                            this Government to the matter of developing communications between the
                            eastern and western sections of Nicaragua. In this connection I refer
                            particularly to the Nicaraguan Legation’s memoranda of November 30, 1938
                            and August 10, 1940,<note n="17" xml:id="d541fn17">Neither memorandum
                                printed.</note> and to the exchange of views with regard to the
                            possible canalization of the San Juan River.</p>
                        <p>I regret to inform Your Excellency that these studies have clearly shown
                            that the construction of the proposed barge canal is economically
                            impracticable and that, therefore, I consider the project to be one to
                            which the two Governments will wish to give no further consideration.
                            However, my Government is fully aware of the importance of linking the
                            east coast regions of Nicaragua with the regions of the interior and the
                            Pacific coast. The matter is one which has been frequently discussed by
                            representatives of our two Governments. It has now been agreed that the
                            most promising method of achieving the objective would be the
                            construction of a road from San Benito on the Inter-American Highway
                            north of Managua to Rama on the Escondido River, from which point river
                            communication to El Bluff and Bluefields on the Atlantic is
                            available.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of my Government that the existence of the road
                            mentioned would have, under present circumstances, a very important
                            bearing upon the defense of the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, taking into account the spirit of the communications which
                            were exchanged on May 22, 1939 between President Somoza of Nicaragua and
                            President Roosevelt of the United States, my Government is willing, at
                            its own expense, to carry out the following: <list>

                        <p>From the technical and administrative point of view, it would seem
                            desirable that the construction of the proposed highway from San Benito
                            to Rama and the survey from Rama to El Bluff be carried out in the
                            manner contemplated in the subsidiary agreement to be reached between

                            matter. Its purpose is to declare the fact that the Republic of Panama

                            of new lands for the purposes indicated. Article 2 of the General Treaty
                            indicates only that in the event of any contingency, action will be
                            taken in accordance with articles 1 and 10. Thus it is that the real
                            basis of the agreement is contained in article 10 and not in article 2,
                            the basic content of which involves the negation of what has been
                            asked.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic views article 4 with concern as regards
                            the faculty which the Government of the United States <pb n="578"
                                xml:id="pg_578" facs="0592"/>intends—to reserve to itself to
                            “arrest, judge and punish all persons who in such regions may
                            maliciously commit any crime against the security of the military
                            installations located there. …”<note n="7" xml:id="d543fn7">Omission

                        <p>One can accept as an extension of the legal fiction of
                            extraterritoriality, arrest, judgment and punishment for crimes against
                            the security of the military installations within the defense areas; but
                            it is not desirable nor is it absolutely necessary for the purposes of
                            the agreement that Panamanian citizens, within their own territory,
                            unaffected by restrictive clauses stipulated in a Public Treaty, be
                            subjected to this jurisdiction of another country; wherefore it is
                            considered that the said Article might be modified so as to exclude
                            Panamanian citizens from the penal jurisdiction of the United States
                            entirely, except for those cases in which Panamanian citizenship was
                            acquired for the purpose of committing hostile acts against the Canal or
                            the Republic of Panama.</p>
                        <p>Article 9 establishes that “upon completion of these roads (those named
                            in the clause cited) the Republic of Panama will assume responsibility
                            for their maintenance, with the exception of repairs for any damage
                            caused during the existence of this Agreement by transit of armed forces
                            of the United States.”</p>
                        <p>The paragraph transcribed does not fit in with the idea of Clause 9, in
                            as much as the upkeep of said roads will be the responsibility of both
                            parties, in the proportion in which damage is caused by wear and tear or
                            by accident. It is suggested that it be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>It would be more convenient for both parties to substitute periodic
                            estimates of the damage caused by transit of military vehicles of the
                            United States, by quotas calculated on a basis of depreciation and
                            accidental damage caused by said vehicles.</p>
                        <p>In the last paragraph of the same clause it is fitting to specify that
                            the “United States will take <hi rend="italic">at all times</hi> the
                            precautions necessary to avoid, if possible, interruptions of transit in
                            the Republic of Panama.”</p>
                        <p>At the end of Clause 10 will have to be added the following expression:
                            “without prejudice to the free access of the inhabitants established
                            within the restricted areas to their respective properties.”<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d543fn8">This was intended as a limitation on the United

                        </p>
                        <p>Article XII could be completed with the following paragraph: “Whenever it
                            is possible and at reasonable prices, the provisioning and equipment of
                            the bases and their personnel will be done with products, articles and
                            foodstuffs coming from the Republic of Panama.”</p>
                        <p>The provisions of Clause XIII ought to be concrete and uniform, for which
                                [reason]<note n="9" xml:id="d543fn9">Brackets appear in the file
                                translation.</note> the following change is suggested: “The annual

                            of the United States will pay to the Republic of Panama in accordance
                            with this contract shall be one hundred balboas or dollars annually, of
                            the weight and fineness of the present balboa or dollar per hectare.</p>
                        <p>“In case that within the sites chosen for bases there exist buildings,
                            industries, cultivations, installations or improvements, the United
                            States will pay beforehand the indemnities which experts designated by
                            both governments may fix. If the said experts do not reach an agreement
                            in their evaluation, a referee shall be chosen, whose decision shall be
                            final.”</p>
                        <p>I am confident that Your Excellency will receive the viewpoints shown
                            above with consideration and an exact comprehension of the reasons which
                            motivate them.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have the honor to address
                            myself to Your Excellency with the purpose of hastening the conclusion
                            of the Agreement concerning sites for bases for the defense of the Canal
                            during the present conflict.</p>
                        <p>To facilitate the solution of the two points which seem of greatest
                            interest to Your Excellency’s Government, namely, the inclusion of
                            Article II as the basis of negotiation and the reservation on the part
                            of the United States of certain attributes of penal jurisdiction
                            applicable to citizens of the Republic who may threaten the security of
                            the military installations, my Government would be able to accept the
                            following additional amendments and clarifications:</p>
                        <p>1. Suppression of all specific reference to Articles II and X, by which
                            the Agreement would have as its basis the global text of the clauses of
                            the Treaty of March 2, 1936, and</p>
                        <p>2. Modification of Article I of the Agreement as follows:</p>

                            that this state of emergency has ceased to exist upon the beginning of

                        <p>The adoption of this principle offers the advantage of determining the
                            moment in which the occupation of the areas under reference will become
                            unnecessary by reason of the disappearance of all immediate or early
                            danger of aggression, since the release from duty of the conscripts is
                            always equivalent to the implicit declaration of the restoration of
                            international order.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Article IV, which treats of the delegation to the
                            United States of certain jurisdictional attributes within the areas
                            destined to defense, it is appropriate to express that, even although
                            the Penal Code in force in the Republic does not expressly contemplate
                            the juridical location of the delinquent who makes an attempt against
                            the security of military bases set up by an allied nation for the common
                            defense within Panamanian territory, it does give the penalties
                            corresponding to this class of crimes, in their two characteristic
                            aspects: <list>
                                <label>

                                <item>when he does so at the instigation of an enemy power: in the
                                    first case Article 213 is applicable, and in the second Articles
                                    98 and 100, in relation to Article 105 of the Penal Code. The
                                    penalties provided in conformity with the gravity of the crime
                                    reach a maximum of 20 years and do not permit the release of the
                                    persons under trial during the investigation.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>These precepts permit the Panamanian judicial authorities the use of a
                            rigorous criterion in the application of penal arithmetic in those
                            individuals excluded from the jurisdiction of the United States who in
                            any way make an attempt against the installations for defense in the
                            zones provisionally ceded.</p>
                        <p>I am in a position to affirm that the Panamanian Judicial Power, being
                            fully aware of the gravity of the conflict, will act with diligence in
                            the conduct of proceedings of this nature which may arise, with
                            precision in the classification of the crime and with severity in the
                            punishment of the infractor.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statements strengthen the thesis that Panamanian citizens
                            should be totally excluded from the penal jurisdiction delegated to the
                            United States and should be submitted to the ordinary jurisdiction of
                            their country, which is the territorial sovereign, except those cases in
                            which Panamanian citizenship shall have been acquired for the purpose of
                            conducting hostile acts against the Canal or against the Republic of
                            Panamá.</p>
                        <p>I feel convinced that Your Excellency’s Government will consider as just
                            the formula proposed for the term of occupancy and reversion of the
                            areas destined to defense and as sufficient the securities that the
                            Panamanians, excluded from the penal jurisdiction of the United States
                            because of their quality of citizens of a sovereign land, who <pb
                                n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0595"/>may make an attempt against the
                            defense works within said areas will receive punishment in proportion to
                            the gravity of the crime.</p>

                        <p>The Panamanian Government has now replied to our most recent proposal for
                            a contract covering the defense sites. There are two principal points at
                            issue: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The applicability of Article II of the Treaty of 1936
                                    and</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The amount to be paid to Panama as annual rental for the
                                    defense sites.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to the first point, the present Panamanian administration
                            takes almost exactly the same position as that assumed by Dr. de
                                Roux<note n="13" xml:id="d545fn13">Ral de Roux, former Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> in the course of his conversations with you
                            last summer. That Government feels that the acceptance by Panama of our
                            interpretation of Article II would mean an agreement to give the United
                            States lands and territories on a permanent basis beyond that
                            contemplated in the agreement under negotiation. Ambassador Wilson feels
                            that reference to Article II might be omitted in the agreement, but that
                            our position as to the interpretation of this Article might be made
                            plain to the Panamanian Government through some other means. This matter
                            has been discussed in RA<note n="14" xml:id="d545fn14">Division of the
                                American Republics.</note> and the proposal is made, subject to your
                            approval, that the agreement on defense sites omit all reference to
                            specific Articles of the Treaty of 1936 and that it be based upon the
                            joint obligation of the two countries to take all necessary measures for
                            the effective protection of the Canal. A draft along these lines is
                            being prepared.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second principal point upon which agreement has not
                            been reached, the Panamanian Government now proposes that all lands
                            occupied by the defense sites (with the exception of Rio Hato<note
                                n="15" xml:id="d545fn15">Most of the defense sites were relatively
                                small, from 20 to 25 acres; the Rio Hato area consisted of some
                                19,000 acres.</note>), whether public or private, be paid for at a
                            rental rate of $100 per annum per hectare. This would involve the
                            payment of about $700,000 per year (which compares with the Canal
                            annuity of <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0596"/>$430,000 per year).
                            On the basis of a Panamanian willingness to make available the defense
                            sites, we have already stated that we would make concessions to Panama
                            worth many millions of dollars (the railroad lots, the water works and
                            the completion of the Rio Hato Highway, to say nothing of the fact that
                            we are constructing at our expense a number of other highways in the
                            territory of the Republic which will be extremely useful to the
                            Panamanians).</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that Congress will be most unwilling to pass the necessary
                            legislation to make effective the Department’s agreement on these
                            specific points if, at the same time, it is confronted with a defense
                            site agreement under which Panama is paid a most exorbitant sum for the
                            sites themselves. My proposal, therefore, on this point is that we
                            adhere to our original position, which is the same as that agreed to
                            with the British in the case of the island bases, namely, to pay nothing
                            for public lands and for private lands to reimburse the Panamanian
                            Government for legitimate expropriation or other expenditures.</p>
                        <p>There are also a number of minor points at issue regarding such matters
                            as jurisdiction, maintenance of roads, et cetera. I believe that these
                            can be satisfactorily ironed out without troubling you about them.</p>
                        <p>We now have drawn up a draft of a message to Congress<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d545fn16">Not printed.</note> proposing legislation needed
                            to transfer the railroad lots and the water works, and to reimburse
                            Panama for her share in the Rio Hato Highway. I have had two
                            conversations recently in the War Department on this subject, the last
                            one with Mr. Harvey Bundy, the Secretary of War’s Special Assistant. My
                            purpose has been to keep the War Department informed in general as to
                            the progress of these negotiations and to assure myself that the War
                            Department was fully aware of the extremely cooperative attitude of the
                            present Panamanian Government. I believe that the War Department, while
                            not highly enthusiastic about the twelve points,<note n="17"

                            cooperative in the matter of the legislation which, I assume, in

                            railroad lots will be introduced by the War Department when and if the

                        <p>The Government of Panama has received with pleasure the information
                            furnished to it by its Ambassador at Washington regarding the acceptance
                            by the Government of the United States of America of the modification
                            introduced by the said Ambassador in point five, out of the twelve
                            involved in the just aspirations of Panama to obtain certain
                            compensations for the vital concessions which Panama has granted for the
                            defense of the Panama Canal, to the effect that the Panamanian
                            Government should fix a specific sum of money which the Government of
                            the United States of America will pay annually to the Republic of
                            Panama, as compensation for the damage done to the Panamanian highways
                            by the transit over them of the American motorized army.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama, in accordance with its purpose of accelerating
                            as far as may be possible to it the course of these negotiations which
                            it considers of invaluable importance for the United States of America
                            and for the Republic of Panama, and being aware that it is incumbent
                            upon it to indicate the value of the damage annually suffered by its
                            highways, which value is to be compensated for in part by the American
                            Government, has made minute and detailed studies regarding the
                            conservation of its national roads, and has arrived at the conclusion
                            that the expense which it incurs in order to keep them in good condition
                            amounts approximately to the sum of three hundred thousand dollars a
                            year.</p>
                        <p>The Panamanian Government, being aware that the cost of repair of its
                            roads is so high because the greater part of their wear and tear has
                            been occasioned by the mechanized equipment of the American army which
                            continually passes over them, and knowing the sincere spirit of
                            collaboration which animates the high American officials of the present
                            Administration, estimates that it would be a matter of strict equity and
                            justice that the Government of the United States of America should
                            contribute to the repair of the Panamanian highways the sum of one
                            hundred thousand dollars a year, that is to say the third part of their
                            total cost.</p>

                            insistence on our formula for Article I. He raised much the same
                            arguments and expressed the same points of view as Dr. Fábrega had done
                            in our conversation on this matter on February 26, as reported in my
                            despatch No. 804. The President said flat-footedly that he would never
                            accept Article I of our draft, and that he would prefer to have no
                            Agreement and have the negotiations break down rather than accept such a
                            formula. I went over the same ground with him as I had done previously
                            with Dr. Fábrega, pointing out that the Government of Panamá had never
                            made an issue of Article I heretofore, that the main point had been the
                            elimination of any reference to Article II of the 1936 Treaty, and this
                            we had accepted. The President said that the elimination of reference to
                            not only Article II but also to Article X of the 1936 Treaty made the
                            phraseology of Article I of the draft Agreement even more unacceptable
                            to Panamá, because it left the whole question of evacuation of the lands
                            to future agreement between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he had a new formula to propose, to the
                            effect that the lands would be evacuated and revert to Panamá one year
                            after the signature of the Treaty of Peace, except that if during this
                            one year period both Governments were in agreement that danger still
                            existed, then consultation would take place for a new agreement for the
                            continued temporary occupation of the defense sites, or of some of them.
                            I asked if he could give me his proposal in writing and he said that the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs would hand it to me within a day or so. The
                            President said that these alternative proposals, the one made in Foreign
                            Office Note No. 3177 of February 25,<note n="20" xml:id="d547fn20">See
                                footnote 12, <ref target="#pg_579">p. 579</ref>.</note> transmitted
                            by my despatch No. 804 of February 27, and the one which the Foreign
                            Minister would hand me shortly, were his last words on the matter. He
                            said that his own preference was for the new formula which he had just
                            outlined and which would <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0599"/>be
                            given me by the Foreign Minister. It was agreed that I would await the
                            text of this formula and then report it to Washington for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>A note from the Foreign Minister, No. 3239 of March 6, has now been
                            received, which, among other matters, contains this formula. A single
                            copy of the note in Spanish, and office translation, are attached
                            hereto. The formula for Article I in English translation reads as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Republic of Panamá grants to the United States the temporary
                                    use for defense purposes of the lands referred to in the
                                    Memorandum attached to this Agreement and forming an integral
                                    part thereof. These lands shall be evacuated and the use thereof
                                    by the United States of America shall cease one year after the
                                    date on which the Treaty of Peace which brings about the
                                    cessation of the present war shall have entered into effect. If
                                    within that period the two Governments believe that, in spite of
                                    the cessation of hostilities, a state of emergency continues to
                                    exist which makes vitally necessary the continuation of any of
                                    the said defense bases or areas, the two Governments shall again
                                    enter into mutual consultation and shall conclude the new
                                    agreement which the circumstances require.</p>
                                <p>“The national authorities of the Republic of Panamá shall have
                                    access at all times to the defense sites mentioned herein.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>As regards this matter, my opinion is the following: As reported in my
                            despatch No. 804, I believe that the earlier proposal, that the lands
                            would be evacuated and revert to Panamá “upon the beginning of the
                            demobilization of the forces called to arms by the United States because
                            of the present war”, should be satisfactory to us. Under this formula
                            the whole matter is left in our hands, we cannot be called upon to
                            evacuate the sites until after we have begun demobilization, and it is
                            inconceivable that we should in fact demobilize until all danger has
                            ceased to exist. I prefer this formula to the new one giving a year’s
                            grace after the signature of a Treaty of Peace, because it is not
                            impossible that an inconclusive Treaty of Peace might be patched up
                            merely to give both sides time to prepare for the continuance of the war
                            a little later. On the other hand, the proposal provides for
                            consultation and negotiation in the event of continuing danger after a
                            Treaty of Peace. We should probably be reasonably safe in accepting
                            either formula.</p>
                        <p>To revert to my conversation with the President: After the discussion of
                            Article I we had considerable discussion of Article XII, concerning the
                            amount to be paid for the use of the defense sites. It came out in this
                            discussion that the President probably would be willing to accept an
                            annual rental of $1 for all public lands, provided $100 annual rental
                            per hectare was paid for the privately owned lands. At this point,
                            however, a new and rather disturbing factor arose. I said that on the
                            foregoing basis of $100 per hectare annual rental for the private lands,
                            it was of course my understanding that <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586"
                                facs="0600"/>the large Rio Hato site would, for reasons which were
                            obvious, not be included in this treatment but be handled as a separate
                            case. At this point Dr. Fábrega interjected with considerable vehemence
                            that this was not at all his understanding and that on the contrary he
                            had understood that all privately-owned lands used by the United States
                            would be treated on the same basis and that whatever rental was paid for
                            other privately-owned sites would be paid for Rio Hato. I pointed out
                            that in my discussions with Dr. de Roux, before the present Government
                            came into office, it had been the point of view of the Panamanian
                            Government that Rio Hato should not be included with the other defense
                            sites but should be treated on a different basis. I further pointed out
                            that the United States Army had been renting Rio Hato since January 21,
                            1935, paying $2400 annually for the 7676 hectares with an option of
                            purchase at $18 per hectare. I said that these figures which had been
                            agreed upon in the contract between the Army and Mr. Kierulff, the owner
                            of the land, had been accepted by Mr. Kierulff as fully satisfactory and
                            represented an idea of what the owner considered a fair value. I also
                            pointed out that I had been advised by the State Department (instruction
                            No. 523 of February 18, 1942<note n="21" xml:id="d547fn21">Not
                                printed.</note>), that the Panamanian proposal that public and
                            private lands be paid for at a rental rate of $100 annually per hectare,
                            involving the payment of approximately $700,000 a year (exclusive of Rio
                            Hato), was regarded as excessive. Furthermore, that it was felt in the
                            United States that in view of the many millions of dollars of benefits
                            which would accrue to Panamá from our favorable action on the Railroad
                            lots, liquidation of the Rio Hato credit, etc., the United States
                            Congress would be reluctant to pass this legislation approving the
                            transfer of the Railroad lots, etc., if at the same time it had before
                            it a defense site agreement under which Panamá was to be paid an
                            exorbitant sum for the sites themselves. I said that on the basis of the
                            Panamanian proposals, the Government of Panamá was asking the United
                            States, in addition to all the benefits which Panamá would derive from
                            the 12 points, to pay an annual rental for the defense sites of
                            approximately $700,000 for the sites exclusive of Rio Hato, and $767,600
                            for Rio Hato, making a total of $1,467,600 annual rental. I said that I
                            could not believe that the Panamanian Government meant this seriously.
                            Dr. Fábrega said that the rental for public lands could be omitted. I
                            said that we, of course, had no figures on the break-down between public
                            and privately owned lands and were still awaiting this information from
                            the Panamanian authorities. Assuming, however,—and the assumption might
                            be wide of the mark—that on this basis we would be called upon to pay,
                            say, $300,000 annual rental for the privately owned lands, this added to
                            what they were now asking for Rio Hato <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587"
                                facs="0601"/>would mean an annual payment of over $1,000,000. I also
                            pointed out that it seemed most exaggerated to request the United States
                            to pay $767,600 annual rental for an area for which we were at present
                            paying only $2400 annual rental, with an option of purchase at only $18
                            a hectare, all this to the entire satisfaction of the owner. Dr. Fábrega
                            said that so far as he was concerned Rio Hato would have to be treated
                            on the same basis as the other privately owned lands.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President intervened to say that he recalled distinctly
                            that under the previous Government consideration had been given to
                            treating Rio Hato as a separate case, apart from the other defense
                            sites. He asked how I thought the matter might be handled. I said that
                            my personal suggestion would be the following: Either that a separate
                            agreement be made for Rio Hato in which we would continue to pay for the
                            duration of the emergency a reduced rental, approximately that which we
                            are now paying, or else that the Rio Hato site would be thrown in with
                            the other defense sites, but that the rental for Rio Hato be figured at
                            the lower amount, approximately that which we are now paying. The
                            President said that he would give further consideration to this matter
                            and would see that I was advised later concerning it.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I then said to the President that I would be less than frank if I failed
                            to make clear to him that a somewhat painful impression had been
                            produced in Washington by the claim of the Panamanian Government to
                            receive large sums of money for the use of these defense sites. I said
                            that it had been the understanding in Washington, after the request for
                            the use of the defense sites had been made by the United States, that
                            when the former Panamanian administration presented its 12 points,
                            favorable action on the part of the United States concerning these
                            requests would be regarded as full and ample compensation for the use of
                            the defense sites, I said that a good deal of surprise had therefore
                            been caused by, first, the utterly fantastic request of the Arnulfo
                            Arias administration for a rental of $4,000 per hectare, and then later
                            by the maintenance by the present Panamanian administration of a request
                            for a considerable annual rental.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke at some length of the other factors involved in the
                            matter besides the commercial one, of the virtually complete occupation
                            of the Republic of Panamá by the armed forces of the United States, and
                            the additional expenses involved for Panamá in increasing its police
                            force and taking on other employees to assist in maintaining order
                            throughout these areas, etc., etc.</p>
                        <p>The new proposal made for rental in Panamanian note No. 3239 of March 6,
                            is, in brief, that the United States should pay rental of <pb n="588"
                                xml:id="pg_588" facs="0602"/>$100 per hectare annually for the
                            privately-owned lands, and $1 per hectare annually for the
                            Government-owned lands. An exception would be made for Rio Hato, the
                            rental for this area to be fixed by two experts, one appointed by each
                            Government, and in case of disagreement an arbitrator to be named whose
                            decision would be final. The experts, in fixing the amount of rental for
                            Rio Hato, would take into account not only the intrinsic value of the
                            land but also “the injuries, burdens and consequences of every kind
                            which may befall the Republic of Panamá through the use of these lands
                            by the military forces of the United States”.</p>
                        <p>The annual rental for all the defense sites would be paid as from the
                            date on which the United States began to enjoy the temporary use of the
                            lands, except that in the case of Rio Hato the United States would be
                            permitted to deduct from the rental fixed for this area, the sums which
                            have been paid annually to date to the owner of the land.</p>
                        <p>The Panamanian proposal for Article XII maintains the provision in the
                            earlier Panamanian draft that payment will be by the United States for
                            all buildings, cultivations, improvements, etc., existing on the defense
                            sites, the value of such buildings, etc., to be fixed by experts
                            appointed by both Governments, and in event of disagreement between the
                            experts then an arbitrator to make the final decision.</p>
                        <p>My recommendations on this point of rental are as follows: That we should
                            indicate to the Panamanian Government willingness in principle to
                            consider the proposal that privately-owned lands be paid at the rate of
                            $100 per hectare annually, and public lands at $1 per hectare annually,
                            subject to examination of information to be received from the Panamanian
                            Government as to the approximate amount of these lands which are in fact
                            privately-owned and the approximate amount which are public lands.</p>
                        <p>As regards Rio Hato, it will be noted that the Panamanian proposal is in
                            effect that the new rental basis for this area should be applied
                            retroactively to the time when the United States first began renting Rio
                            Hato, January 21, 1935. I believe that we should propose that the new
                            rental basis for Rio Hato should commence either on January 1, 1943, at
                            the expiration of the existing contract between the Army and the owner
                            of this land, or else at some more recent date, for instance, the date
                            on which the first of the defense sites proper was formally occupied by
                            the United States. As to the amount of rental to be paid for Rio Hato, I
                            believe it preferable to fix this amount in the Agreement rather than
                            leave it to later negotiation and probable arbitration. If the
                            Department is prepared to consider the Panamanian proposal of $100
                            annual rental per hectare for the privately-owned lands exclusive of Rio
                            Hato, then I suggest <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0603"/>that I be
                            authorized so to inform the Panamanian Government, but on condition that
                            the rental fixed for Rio Hato be only slightly higher than that now
                            being paid under the Army’s lease. We might offer, instead of the
                            present rental of $2400 per annum, $12,000 or $15,000 per annum. If the
                            Panamanian Government insists upon a higher rental, then we should state
                            that we will be unable to consider $100 per hectare for the private
                            lands but would have to scale this figure down so that the total amount
                            we should be paying for all private lands, including Rio Hato, would not
                            amount to more than $100 per hectare for the privately-owned lands
                            exclusive of Rio Hato, plus $12,000 to $15,000 for Rio Hato.</p>
                        <p>Before reaching a final agreement regarding the rental for these defense
                            sites, we should have a definite understanding with the Government of
                            Panamá regarding the two areas for Combat Teams near Chorrera and Pacora
                            (despatches No. 527 of January 17, 1942, and No. 568 of January 24,
                                1942,<note n="22" xml:id="d547fn22">Neither printed.</note> page 9).
                            The Chorrera area comprises 530 hectares and Pacora 1010 hectares. I
                            recently discussed this matter with Dr. Fábrega, and in view of the
                            uncertainty as to whether these areas will be used throughout the period
                            of the emergency, I agreed, at his suggestion, to continue their present
                            status, which rests upon the basis that these forces are carrying out
                            maneuvers, for the next few months. Permission on a three months’ basis
                            was originally accorded by the Panamanian Government for maneuvers by
                            these forces in both areas, and Dr. Fábrega proposes to extend this
                            permission for two or three further periods of three months each. As
                            there is, however, likelihood that these areas may in fact be utilized
                            by our forces throughout the emergency, I believe we should have an
                            understanding that if this takes place, then whatever rental or charge
                            might be made by Panamá for the use of these areas, should be at a lower
                            figure than that paid for defense sites as such.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that Panamanian Note No. 3239 of March 6 covers
                            several other points besides Article I and Article XII. These points,
                            with my comments concerning them based upon necessarily hasty
                            consideration today, are as follows: <list>

                                <item>The final paragraph of the Panamanian proposal for Article I
                                    provides that the national authorities of the Republic of Panamá
                                    shall have access at all times to the defense sites. Our draft
                                    provided that such access should be subject to arrangement with
                                    the military authorities of the United States. I believe that
                                    the Panamanian proposal is made more from a sense of maintaining
                                    prestige than from airything else, and that if we should accept
                                    it there would in fact be little tendency on their part to
                                    exercise the right. On the other hand, it is clear that these
                                    areas are military reservations, and no one outside of our armed
                                    forces can expect to appear at the areas at any time and be
                                    admitted to them. I would suggest, therefore, that we might
                                    accept <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0604"/>their proposal

                                    authorities to these sites and to prevent misunderstandings,
                                    such authorities should communicate sufficiently in advance with
                                    the military authorities of the United States in order that
                                    appropriate arrangements might be made for them to visit the
                                    sites.</item>

                                <item>The proposal for a change in the tenth line of Article IV is
                                    to make this section of Article IV agree with the second
                                    paragraph of Article I as proposed of Panamá (see above). If we
                                    accept the Panamanian proposal on the second paragraph of
                                    Article I, then this change in Article IV can also be

                                    formulas proposed by Panamá for Article I may prove acceptable

                                <item>With reference to the third paragraph of Article VIII,
                                    regarding repair of damage to roads, Panamá proposes that
                                    instead of consultation between the appropriate authorities of
                                    the two Governments to fix the share of the United States, there
                                    be agreement now on a fixed annual sum to be paid by the United
                                    States. The Panamanian note refers to conversations which the
                                    Ambassador of Panamá has had in Washington on this subject,
                                    conversations concerning which I have no information. It strikes
                                    me, however, that it would be preferable in fact to agree now
                                    upon a fixed sum rather than to have consultations and probably
                                    disputes in the future regarding the respective shares of the
                                    two Governments in the damage caused to Panamanian roads. One
                                    possible way of arriving at a fixed amount would be to agree
                                    that the United States would pay, say half the amount actually
                                    expended in the previous year by Panamá for the repair of
                                    Panamanian highways. According to information furnished the
                                    Embassy by Mr. Humbard, of the Public Roads Administration,
                                    Panamá spent during the period 1931–1941 an average of $280,000
                                    annually for road maintenance; in 1941 $318,000 was
                                    spent.</item>

                        <p>I should appreciate the Department’s instructions on the foregoing
                            points. I suggest that this time, instead of sending a new
                            counter-draft, the Department give me instructions to be followed in
                            conversations on the points raised, affording me some latitude in these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>To revert to the question of rental for the defense sites, Article XII,
                            it occurs to me on further consideration that the best arrangement from
                            our point of view would be to offer a fixed sum as rental, say, $300,000
                            or $400,000 annually to cover all the lands, including Rio <pb n="591"
                                xml:id="pg_591" facs="0605"/>Hato, leaving to the Government of
                            Panamá to pay costs of expropriation, indemnities for improvements, and
                            such further payments to the private owners as it might judge desirable.
                            This would avoid bickerings and disputes, and possible arbitrations,
                            over questions of valuation and indemnities. In my judgment, the
                            Government of Panamá would not accept anything less than $300,000 a
                            year.</p>

                            <p>My Government proposes that Article 1 read as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Republic of Panamá grants to the United States the
                                        temporary use for defense purposes of the lands referred to
                                        in the Memorandum attached to this Agreement and forming an
                                        integral part thereof. These lands shall be evacuated and
                                        the use thereof by the United States of America shall cease
                                        one year after the date on which the treaty of peace which
                                        brings about the cessation of the present war shall have
                                        entered into effect. If within that period the two
                                        Governments believe that, in spite of the cessation of
                                        hostilities, a state of emergency continues to exist which
                                        makes vitally necessary the continuation of any of the said
                                        defense bases or areas, the two Governments shall again
                                        enter into mutual consultation and shall conclude the new
                                        agreement which the circumstances require.</p>
                                    <p>“The national authorities of the Republic of Panamá shall
                                        have access at all times to the defense sites mentioned
                                        herein.”</p>
                                </quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>As I have had occasion to manifest to Your Excellency on various
                                occasions, it is impossible for the Government of Panamá to accept
                                any article which, in referring to the period of occupancy of the
                                lands destined to defense sites, permits or even leaves in doubt the
                                fact that those lands can remain occupied for an indefinite period
                                even after the present war emergency has ceased to exist. The
                                occupation, which in fact exists today, of Panamanian territory by
                                the <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0606"/>military forces of the
                                United States is so vast that it covers zones of land situated in
                                all the Provinces, without exception, into which the Republic is
                                divided. This occupation on such a large scale, even if the
                                Government can endure it as a painful necessity during the period of
                                the present war emergency and as an example of its desire to
                                cooperate in the defense of the Panamá Canal, interferes seriously
                                with our territorial integrity, with our life as a free and
                                sovereign nation, and gives rise, frequently, to disagreeable
                                incidents injurious to the good name of our Republic.</p>
                            <p>This Government has not hesitated in giving its full and decided
                                cooperation in face of the present war emergency. But it must
                                respond, at the same time, to its patriotic duty of not authorizing
                                that occupation for an indefinite period after the termination of
                                the present conflict.</p>
                            <p>This is such a vital point for my Government, insofar as this present
                                Agreement is concerned, that I must advise Your Excellency that the
                                formula contained in Article I which my Government now proposes
                                represents the maximum of our concessions as far as the duration of
                                the said occupation is concerned and is, therefore, our definitive
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>In Article IV, my Government proposes a slight change in the
                                phraseology, in the second line. My Government proposes that instead
                                of the initial phrase of this clause which says: <quote

                            <p>My Government proposes that Article V read as follows: <quote

                                        cooperation given by Panamá in making these temporary
                                        defense sites available and also recognizing the burden

                                        Republic of Panamá, expressly undertake the obligation to

                                        terminate completely the use thereof, at the latest within
                                        one year after the date on which the treaty of peace which
                                        brings about the cessation of the present war, shall have

                            </p>
                            <p>The purpose of the amendment is to make this phrase agree with the
                                provisions of the last paragraph of Article XII, as that Article is
                                proposed by my Government, as set forth below. It should be observed
                                that in the project presented by the United States on October 28,
                                1941, mention was not made in this Article VI of the buildings,
                                structures, improvements, etc., which were not constructed by the
                                United States. Since there are included in the new project all the
                                buildings or structures which exist in said areas, even though they
                                were not constructed by the United States, the change proposed here
                                is necessary in order that this article may agree with Article XII
                                proposed hereinafter insofar as it refers to indemnity for the
                                buildings, improvements, etc., existing in these areas at the time
                                of their occupation and which were not constructed by the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>In the same Article VI, it is suggested that in the last three lines
                                of that Article the phrase: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>This amendment is for the purpose of preventing the inference that
                                Panamá would dispossess itself completely of its jurisdiction over
                                the said areas during the period of their use for defense
                                purposes.</p>
                            <p>In Article VIII, my Government proposes that, in the 6th line of the
                                third paragraph, the phrase which says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>My Government appreciates, Mr. Ambassador, that the United States in
                                this new project have made some changes in consideration of the
                                counter-proposals suggested by the Panamanian Government. And in
                                turn, as you will observe, my Government, in the counterproposals
                                presented herewith, has made new concessions in consideration of the

                                certain changes mentioned here which are changes in form or
                                phraseology rather than basic changes, the counter-proposals which

                                essential, represent the maximum limit to which my Government may go

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report, for the sake
                            of the record, and with special reference to my despatch No. 321 of
                            October 29, 1941, and to the Department’s instruction No. 341 of
                            November 21, 1941,<note n="25" xml:id="d549fn25">Neither printed.</note>
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>During my conversation on March 5 with the President (see despatch No.
                            922 of March 9) I said to him that I wished to make <pb n="597"
                                xml:id="pg_597" facs="0611"/>clear one aspect of these negotiations,
                            in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding or charge of bad faith
                            that might otherwise arise in the future. I said that in my conversation
                            with Foreign Minister Fábrega on February 26<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d549fn26">Reported in despatch No. 804, February 27, 1942,
                                from the Ambassador in Panama, not printed (711F.1914/427).</note> I
                            had spoken at length on this particular point, and that I wished to
                            mention it to him. I stated that it was of course clear that we were
                            negotiating the present lease agreement on the basis that the defense
                            sites would be made available temporarily to the United States and that
                            they would be evacuated and revert to Panamá as soon as conditions no
                            longer warranted their continued use. I said, however, that the military
                            advisers of our Government had pointed out that with the development of
                            aerial warfare and the tendency towards undeclared wars beginning
                            without previous warning, that in their opinion there would always be a
                            necessity in the future, if the United States Government was to
                            maintain, operate and adequately defend the Panamá Canal, for the
                            retention by the United States of a certain number of these defense
                            sites. I said that these military advisers felt that many of the defense
                            sites, such as gun positions and some of the air fields, could be
                            abandoned, once so-called peaceful times had been restored, but that in
                            their judgment certain auxiliary air fields and particularly aircraft
                            warning stations would have to be maintained for all time hereafter. I
                            said that in my judgment it was very likely that at the close of this
                            present war, when the United States Government under the terms of the
                            agreement we were negotiating would prepare to evacuate these sites, it
                            would be found necessary to request the Government of Panamá, as a
                            result of experience gained in the war and as a measure required for the
                            effective protection of the Canal, to lease or make available in some
                            manner on a long term basis certain of these defense sites. The
                            President made no comment nor did he raise any objection to what I had
                            said. I might add that when I expressed myself in the same sense to
                            Foreign Minister Fábrega on February 26, he said that he appreciated
                            this fully, and that there was no reason that he could see why the
                            Panamanian Government at the time contemplated should not consider the
                            matter and undertake a negotiation for such sites. He stressed that this
                            would of course be a new negotiation.</p>

                        <p>153. For the Acting Secretary. Reference my letter March 10<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d550fn27">Not printed.</note> regarding the negotiations for
                            the defense sites. I strongly urge you to authorize me without delay to
                            reach agreement with the Panamanian Government on the lines recommended
                            in my letter and despatch no. 922 of March 9.</p>
                        <p>I have had another talk with the President and the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs. They are becoming nervous and disturbed about the matter. The
                            Government is losing prestige because of inability to announce the
                            benefits which Panamá will get in return for turning over the Republic
                            to military occupation by United States armed forces. This occupation is
                            causing frequent incidents and creating constant sources of irritation.
                            The public in general (and in particular the political opposition
                            including supporters of the previous administration who are becoming
                            much more active of late because of this situation) are demanding what
                            the Government is doing to protect Panamanian interests. Unless we can
                            soon place the Panamanian Government in a position to announce a
                            satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations with the benefits accruing
                            to Panamá we shall run the risk of drifting into a situation in which
                            incalculable damage may be done to the friendly and cooperative
                            atmosphere which has been built up here.</p>
                        <p>We are now in possession of all the necessary elements to conclude an
                            agreement which in my judgement should be satisfactory to us and
                            equitable to Panama. If you will give me the instructions requested I
                            believe I can reach agreement in a week with the possible exception of
                            minor points of drafting.</p>

                        <p>162. Your despatch 922, March 9, 1942. You are authorized to accept draft
                            of Article I as proposed by Panama in its note D.P. 3239 dated March 6,
                            1942, inserting in paragraph 1 “definitive” before “treaty” and changing
                            “state of emergency” to read “state of international insecurity”. The
                            Panamanian proposal for Article V should be modified accordingly. You
                            may likewise accept, <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0613"/>making
                            such changes in phraseology as you deem desirable, the suggested
                            modifications of all other articles, except the proposed addition to
                            Article VIII concerning wear and damage to roads and the proposals for
                            Article XII concerning annual rentals.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels it is unable at this time to determine the extent of
                            wear or damage to Panamanian roads which will be caused yearly by troop
                            movements, and therefore prefers to retain the phraseology submitted by
                            this Government. There would apparently be no more room for disagreement
                            regarding the estimate at a later date than there is at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Department reiterates its proposal of an annual rental of one balboa
                            for all the public lands. Further consideration will be given the
                            question of the rentals to be paid for the use of private lands when
                            figures on the breakdown between public and privately owned lands are
                            made available. Please urge the appropriate Panamanian authorities to
                            endeavor to obtain this information for Department at earliest possible
                            date. When agreement has been reached on all other provisions of the
                            draft agreement, please forward copy of phraseology agreed upon.</p>

                            have reached agreement on the text of the draft Agreement with the
                            exception of that part of Article VIII which refers to the method of
                            determining the amount to be paid by the United States to repair wear
                            and damage to the roads of Panamá caused by troop movements, and with
                            the exception of Article XII as it relates to the rental to be paid for

                        <p>As regards Article VIII, Dr. Fábrega tells me that following our
                            conversation on March 20 he placed before the Panamanian Cabinet and
                            urged acceptance of the State Department point of view that the
                            phraseology submitted in our draft of February 13, 1942, be accepted.
                            Subsequently, however, a note was received from Ambassador Jaén Guardia
                            dated March 20, stating that he had seen Acting Secretary Welles on
                            March 19 and had requested that the Panamanian proposal that an annual
                            sum be fixed in the Agreement to cover the cost of repairs to roads be
                            accepted by the State Department. The Ambassador reported that Mr.
                            Welles had said that there would be a meeting of some governmental Board
                            on March 20 and that he would see that the Ambassador’s request was laid
                            before this Board. Dr. Fábrega said that as this conversation had taken
                            place on March 19, subsequent to the date of the State Department’s
                            instructions to me on which our conversation in Panama had taken place
                            on March 20, the Panamanian Government would prefer to await a report
                            from Ambassador Jaén Guardia on the further talk which he expected to
                            have with Mr. Welles following the meeting of the Board on March 20. Dr.
                            Fábrega said that he hoped we might accept the Panamanian proposal, as
                            the fixing of a lump sum payment would obviate protracted discussions
                            over this point in the future. I reiterated to Dr. Fábrega that I had
                            not been informed by the State Department of any conversations which
                            Ambassador Jaén Guardia may have had in Washington on this matter, but
                            that I would report to the Department what he told me concerning it. I
                            request the Department’s instructions regarding this Article.</p>
                        <p>As regards Article XII, Dr. Fábrega told me today that Panama will accept
                            an annual rental of B.100 for all the public lands. As regards the
                            private lands, he handed me a confidential letter, a single copy of
                            which I am attaching hereto.<note n="29" xml:id="d552fn29">Not
                                printed.</note> (There is no time before closing the air mail pouch
                            to make a translation). It will be noted from this letter that the
                            breakdown given can only be very approximate. This is because of various
                            factors: only about half the defense sites have been accurately
                            surveyed; moreover, there is considerable discrepancy between the
                            figures of the Panamanian Commission and those of our Army Commission
                            even as regards those sites which are supposed to be accurately
                            surveyed; furthermore, as regards a number of the sites that have been
                            recently requested and permission for occupancy of which has been given
                            informally by Panama because of urgent need to begin preparation of the
                            defense works, only a very rough description has been furnished the
                            Panamanian Commission by our Army Commission and this, in many cases,
                            does not permit the Panamanian Government to identify accurately the
                            areas in question.</p>
                        <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0615"/>
                        <p>On the basis, however, of this very rough and approximate breakdown, it
                            appears, according to the information furnished by Dr. Fárega, that some
                            2,312 hectares are public lands; some 5,515 hectares are private lands
                            exclusive of Rio Hato; and 7,774 hectares comprise the privately-owned
                            area of Rio Hato, which, as indicated in Dr. Fábrega’s letter, can, if
                            desired, be treated for rental purposes on a basis different from that
                            applied to the other private lands.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to receive the Department’s instructions as to the
                            question of rental for the private lands. My recommendations on this
                            point were made in the last paragraph of my despatch No. 922 of March 9,
                            1942, and in my letter to Acting Secretary Welles of March 10,

                        <p>227. The Panamanian Ambassador came in yesterday to reiterate his
                            proposal previously made to the Under Secretary that an annual sum be
                            fixed to cover this Government’s share of the cost of repairs to
                            Panamanian roads caused by troop movements. He referred in particular to
                            the inadequacy of the phraseology of Item 5 of the Department’s
                            memorandum of July 8, 1941<note n="30" xml:id="d553fn30">

                            negotiations on the twelve points. The Ambassador recently sent a
                            memorandum to the Department<note n="31" xml:id="d553fn31">Dated
                                February 19, <ref target="#pg_583">p. 583</ref>.</note> stating that
                            detailed studies regarding the conservation of Panamanian roads had
                            revealed that the expense incurred yearly in road maintenance amounted
                            to approximately $300,000 and suggested that this Government contribute
                            one third of this amount or an annual sum of $100,000.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was apprised of the phraseology of Article VIII of the
                            Department’s most recent draft of the defense site agreement and was
                            informed in the sense of the second paragraph of the Department’s
                            telegram no. 162 of March 19, 1942 to the effect that it does not seem
                            feasible at this time to endeavor to determine the extent of wear and
                            damage to Panamanian roads which will be caused yearly by troop
                            movements, and that it would therefore seem preferable to retain the
                            phraseology submitted by this Government. The Ambassador was informed
                            that the Department agreed that this Government’s responsibility should
                            be designated in the form of a fixed sum <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602"
                                facs="0616"/>or of a proportionate share of the total maintenance
                            cost of Panamanian roads but that in the interest of bringing these
                            negotiations to a prompt conclusion, the details concerning maintenance
                            responsibilities should be the subject of subsequent consultations and a
                            subsidiary agreement to be worked out by local road experts of the two
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador has now been handed a copy of the Department’s proposal
                            for Item 5 of the twelve point memorandum and has promised to consult
                            his Government immediately concerning the Department’s proposal. The
                            phraseology submitted to the Ambassador is identical to that of Article
                            VIII of the defense site agreement with the exception that in paragraph
                            4, second sentence, there is inserted after the word “maintenance” the
                            following expression “of these roads as well as all Panamanian roads
                            used periodically or frequently by the armed forces of the United
                            States.” This has the effect of making the article on roads in the
                            twelve point memorandum general while the article on roads in the
                            defense site agreement remains specific referring only to those roads
                            which are enumerated.</p>

                        <p>The Panamanian Ambassador came in this morning at his request. He stated
                            that his Government does not consider acceptable our proposal to have
                            the amount to be paid to Panama for road maintenance by this Government
                            subject to further discussions. The Panamanian Government wishes to have
                            the figure set at this time and proposes $100,000 per annum as the
                            appropriate figure. The Ambassador said that in part the attitude of the
                            Panamanian Government arose from a fear that unless the road maintenance
                            matter was specifically presented to our Congress at this time, together
                            with the defense sites arrangement and the other items which Panama is
                            to receive, it might be difficult for us to secure the funds. In reply I
                            said that in our judgment we would have no difficulty in obtaining the
                            necessary funds to fulfill any commitment which we might make to Panama,
                            and that this was a matter which we had of course examined before making
                            the proposal in the form which he had received it last week.</p>
                        <p>However, I stated that I would be glad to have a check of the situation
                            made to determine whether we could enter into a commitment <pb n="603"
                                xml:id="pg_603" facs="0617"/>to pay Panama $100,000 annually for
                            road maintenance. Please arrange to consult the appropriate people in
                            the War Department and in The Panama Canal in order to get their views
                            urgently on this subject. I should think that Governor Edgerton would be
                            the best-informed person on this subject. If we do agree upon a specific
                            amount, I think we would wish to obtain a specific commitment from
                            Panama as to the type of maintenance envisaged. This point was one which
                            I hoped would be covered in the subsidiary agreement between the
                            appropriate authorities of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Please endeavor to expedite the clearing of this point.</p>

                            You are authorized to accept Panamanian proposal that the section in
                            Article VIII of the defense site agreement referring to maintenance of
                            roads should be general and thereby include all roads in Panama used by
                            the armed forces of this Government. In the subsidiary agreement the
                            Department prefers that this Government’s responsibilities be designated
                            in the form of a proportionate share of the total annual maintenance
                            costs. You are authorized to propose that this Government’s
                            responsibilities in this respect be fixed at one third the total
                            maintenance costs. This is the proportionate share which the Panamanian
                            Government through its Ambassador in Washington has suggested that this
                            Government bear.</p>

                            in existence before negotiations were begun for the use of the other

                            since the nature of the activities and installations at Rio Hato are
                            such that an arrangement for a relatively long term tenure of that base
                            is desirable (an arrangement which is not guaranteed under the

                            consider the possibility of expropriating the Rio Hato property on the
                            understanding that this Government would rent the area beginning January
                            1, 1943, at the rate of 10,000 balboas per annum for a 99 year period or
                            for an indefinite period which would extend until such time as the two
                            Governments would agree that conditions no longer warrant the use of Rio

                        <p>313. Your 269, April 15, 7 p.m. I fear there is no possibility whatsoever
                            that the Panamanian Government would accept such a proposal. It is my
                            belief that the Government will not give consideration to a separate
                            agreement for Rio Hato until such time as it knows what rental we are
                            prepared to pay for the privately-owned lands under the defense sites
                            agreement. My judgment is that no useful purpose would be served by
                            presenting a separate proposal for Rio Hato in advance of making known
                            our offer regarding rental for the defense sites.</p>

                        <p>331. Your 245, April 9, 4 p.m. The Minister for Foreign Affairs inquires
                            whether there would be any objection to stating in article VIII of the
                            Defense Sites Agreement that the responsibilities of the United States
                            for repairs and maintenance<note n="35" xml:id="d558fn35">Refers to all

                            ending with the words “as set forth below.” If this is not acceptable

                        <p>362. For the Under Secretary, Welles. The President and the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs have both inquired on various occasions recently when
                            our offer on rental for the private lands of the defense sites can be
                            expected. As you know this is the only point which remains unsettled in
                            the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been pressing me almost daily of
                            late on this matter and has today told me off the record that a most
                            embarrassing situation is being created by our failure to make a
                            satisfactory proposal on this point. He says that the subject comes up
                            at every Cabinet meeting and that it has become so embarrassing to him
                            that he has now proposed that he be relieved of the negotiations on this
                            point and that they be transferred to the Panamanian Ambassador in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>As I have reported on many occasions failure to reach agreement and to
                            announce the benefits which Panama will receive places the Panamanian
                            Government in an exceedingly awkward situation and is steadily weakening
                            its position. The Republic of Panama is today under virtual military
                            occupation by the forces of the United States. Incidents involving
                            members of our armed forces are constantly taking place and the general
                            Panamanian attitude towards the United States, which has hitherto been
                            most friendly is beginning to change and an atmosphere of criticism and
                            complaints is being created.</p>
                        <p>The Panamanian Government and people read of the large sums of money
                            which the United States is making over to Brazil, Peru, Colombia, et
                            cetera for services to be received in the future. The Panamanian people
                            are aware that for well over a year Panama has been turning over defense
                            bases throughout the Republic to the United States armed forces and that
                            constant requests are being made by the United States for special
                            favors, consideration and cooperation, and that the Panamanian
                            Government is granting all these requests without stint.</p>
                        <p>It is my considered judgment that unless we can very shortly make a
                            generous proposal to Panama on this rental question, thereby bringing
                            the negotiations to a prompt and satisfactory conclusion, we shall be
                            faced with a very unsatisfactory situation in Panama and one which will
                            be increasingly prejudicial to our national defense efforts in this
                            area.</p>

                                    for the entire Rio Hato tract, commencing January 1, 1943, this
                                    payment to be included in a separate contract for a period which
                                    would extend until such time as the two Governments agree that
                                    conditions no longer warrant the use of Rio Hato as a base
                                    necessary for the protection of the Canal. If, however, the

                                    be determined by experts appointed by both Governments, you are

                            331 of April 20, 1942, stating that the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            inquires whether “there would be any objection to stating in Article
                            VIII of the defense site agreement that the responsibilities of the
                            United States for repairs and maintenance are fixed at one third the
                            total annual maintenance costs.”</p>
                        <p>In principle the Department perceives no objection to the Panamanian
                            proposal but suggests, rather than add a new sentence at the end of
                            paragraph four, that the thought be incorporated into the <pb n="607"
                                xml:id="pg_607" facs="0621"/>last sentence of the paragraph as has
                            been done in the quotation below. If the foregoing is taken into
                            consideration, as well as the agreement expressed in the first sentence
                            of the Department’s telegram no. 245 of April 9, 1942; namely, that the
                            section in Article VIII referring to the maintenance of roads should be
                            general and include all roads, then it is the Department’s understanding
                            that paragraph four of Article VIII of the defense site agreement as
                            amended would read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Upon the completion of these highways the Government of the

                                    as the roads become stabilized. The respective responsibilities

                                2089, May 2, not printed.</note> which will be in the Department
                            tomorrow. One point only departs from telegram number 321, namely that
                            the lease for Rio Hato is to be of the same duration as that for the
                            other defense sites. I consider this entirely satisfactory and request
                            Department’s early approval of this and of various points of procedure
                            mentioned in my despatch of today.</p>
                        <p>I believe you need have but little concern over the Taboga question. The
                            President considers that the conditions covering this lease, reported in
                            my despatch, and which have been accepted by the Commandant of the 15th
                            Naval District will enable him to handle it satisfactorily <pb n="608"
                                xml:id="pg_608" facs="0622"/>with public opinion. I am convinced
                            after careful exploration of all other possible sites that only Taboga
                            meets the essential requirements for this much needed base.</p>

                        <p>There appears to be no reason to anticipate difficulty in obtaining

                            railroad lots and waterworks to Panamá. The Department has requested the
                            War Department to support the proposed legislation. It is my
                            understanding that with the foregoing all remaining points of difference
                            have been eliminated, other than the date of the proposed press

                            defense site agreement and releasing the statement on Wednesday, May 13,
                            noon, Panamanian time, is agreeable to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Since the Panamanian Government intends to make public the text of the

                        <p>With reference to the twelve points the Department prefers not to release
                            at this time any formal text covering any of these points, but has no
                            objection to including in the proposed public statement the substance of
                            the twelve points agreement. Accordingly, the statement to be issued
                            simultaneously in Washington will contain a brief description of the
                            negotiations, the text of the defense site agreement (not including the

                            by the Panama Canal Department.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be a definite consensus among the interested departments
                            of this Government that the intimate association of the residents of the
                            Canal Zone with the cities of Panamá and Colón makes it advisable and
                            necessary that this Government continue to bear the responsibility for
                            the operation of the water and sewerage systems, when the transfer of
                            ownership to Panama is approved by the Congress. The Department is,
                            therefore, of the opinion that you should discuss this matter with the
                            appropriate Canal Zone authorities without further delay and request
                            that they, in close consultation with you, formulate a concise proposal
                            for a management contract under the provisions of which the Panama Canal
                            Department would continue to operate the water and sewerage systems once
                            the title to them has been placed in the hands of the Panamanian
                            authorities. Such a contract should be arranged so as not to prejudice

                            Washington on May 18, 1942, a copy of which was transmitted to you in

                            is made on the drafting of such a contract and requests that before any
                            proposal is made to the Panamanian authorities, the approval of the

                            statements which might be made by certain opposition deputies recalling
                            delays in ratification of the 1936 Treaty, alleging that Panama would
                            probably never effectively get the benefit of the Twelve Points, etc.
                            President de la Guardia appreciates that the two negotiations were
                            independent of each other, and that Panama’s obligation under the 1936
                            Treaty was to make the defense sites available without reference to the
                            action by the United States on the Twelve Points. Nevertheless, as the
                            two negotiations were concluded and announced at the same time, and as
                            public opinion in Panama inevitably links them together, he prefers, for
                            the reason stated hereinabove, not to lay the Defense Sites Agreement
                            before the National Assembly until after the United States Congress has
                            acted on the Twelve Points.</p>

                            memorandum of conversation dated May 27, 1942, between Mr. Wise of RA

                        <p>The Ambassador of Panama<note n="44" xml:id="d568fn44">Ernesto Jan
                                Guardia.</note> called to see me this morning at his request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that his Foreign Minister had asked him to see me in
                            order to let me know that the Government of Panama was concerned by the
                            continuing delay in favorable action on the part of the United States
                            Congress in approving the recent twelve-point agreements entered into by
                            the Government of the United States with the Government of Panama, The
                            Ambassador said that Dr. Fábrega had also asked him to let me know that
                            public opinion in Panama was becoming exercised, and that the
                            propagandists were starting the story <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612"
                                facs="0626"/>that Panama had given everything required by the United
                            States for the war effort, but that the Congress was not going to
                            approve the agreements, and that, consequently, the Government of Panama
                            had made a bad bargain.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I was sure the Government of Panama, as well
                            as public opinion in Panama, must realize that under our Constitutional
                            form of Government immediate action on important questions of this kind
                            was rarely possible. I said that it was my understanding that the
                            Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives had reported
                            out favorably the legislation required in order to carry out the
                            agreements entered into, and that the matter was now before the Foreign
                            Relations Committee of the Senate. I said that, of course, as the
                            Ambassador well knew, very many urgent and pressing measures were now
                            before the Senate for its consideration, and that I could not hold out
                            the slightest hope that final action could be anticipated in the
                            immediate future. I said, however, that I felt that the prospects were
                            favorable and that I would be glad to talk personally with Senator
                            Connally, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, in order to
                            ascertain what his views might be.</p>

                        <p>A–390. In response to recent request for additional defense site for
                            searchlight and radio detector station, Minister for Foreign Affairs has
                            replied referring to his note of July 15 last No. D.P. 3909 (see
                            telegram No. 783, July 16, 4 p.m. and despatch No. 2617 same date),<note

                            Panamanian Government has approved 12 additional defense sites (actually
                            9 new sites and 3 enlargements of old sites) since signature of the
                            Agreement of May 18<note n="46" xml:id="d569fn46">See bracketed note,
                                    <ref target="#pg_609">p. 609</ref>.</note> and that it has
                            become particularly difficult for the Government to continue authorizing
                            the use of national territory without being in a position to inform the
                            country that the agreement signed over 4 months ago has entered into
                            effect. The Foreign Minister states that because of this situation he
                            finds it necessary before authorizing the new defense site requested, to
                            have a meeting of technical representatives of the United States and of
                            Panamá to establish fully the necessity, urgency and other details
                            concerning the new defense site. (Since receipt of this note the Army
                            has requested one more defense site for observation post).</p>
                        <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0627"/>
                        <p>This note from the Foreign Minister is an added indication of the concern
                            which the President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have expressed
                            to me of late regarding the question of early approval by our Congress
                            of those points of the Washington exchange of notes of May 18 which
                            cover the railroad lots, water works and Rio Hato Highway credit.</p>
                        <p>The problem for the Panamanian Government is that until the Defense Sites
                            Agreement enters into effect (which they feel can only be after our
                            Congress acts on the Twelve Points) they are unable to make arrangements
                            with private owners of lands used. As a result criticism of the
                            Government increases steadily, and its opponents charge that the United
                            States either will not ratify the Twelve Points or will delay
                            ratification for some years as in the case of the 1936 Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I have of course explained to the President and to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs that the United States Congress has before it for
                            consideration a great volume of proposed legislation of tremendous
                            importance to the war effort, and have pointed out that as regards the
                            legislation of interest to Panamá the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
                            House has given a favorable report and a hearing of the Senate Committee
                            is taking place today (October 5).<note n="47" xml:id="d569fn47">In
                                telegrams No. 729, August 17, and No. 895, November 24, the

                                and the Senate Committees (711F.1914/526a, 593d).</note> The
                            President and members of his Government, however, are deeply anxious
                            over this question, and their anxiety has been augmented by the
                            injection of the private land claims into the matter.</p>

                            including members of the Cabinet. A member of the <pb n="614"

                            our Government, or whether it was to be a reality. Tato Fábrega has

                            additional sites and enlargements of three old sites. The Panamanian
                            Government acted immediately and favorably on these requests. I have
                            just recently presented two additional requests for defense sites at the
                            urgent request of General Andrews, one for an airplane detector station
                            and one for a beach observation post, and Dr. Fábrega has informed me
                            that it will now be necessary to have these requests considered by
                            technical representatives of both governments to determine the
                            advisability of granting them. I fear that we shall now encounter delay
                            and difficulties in obtaining much needed action in the defense effort.
                            I shall of course make every effort possible to convince the Government
                            that action on defense matters here must not be delayed because of the
                            developments in Washington, and that I believe that the Department’s
                            point of view regarding the private claims will prevail and
                            Congressional approval be obtained within a reasonable time.
                            Nevertheless, I feel that I must let you know that there is a real
                            chance of our running into serious trouble of this nature here until the
                            matter of Congressional action is settled in Washington.</p>
                        <p>President de la Guardia said to me the other day that he had confidence
                            that this matter would eventually work out satisfactorily, because he
                            was confident that President Roosevelt would himself intervene.</p>
                        <p>With all best wishes,</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: It has been most helpful
                            to receive your airgrams and telegrams regarding the reaction in Panama
                            to the <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0629"/>hearings being held
                            before the Senate Subcommittee in connection with the proposed
                            legislation on the “three points”. I have been able to make some
                            effective use of some of this material, on an off-the-record basis. It
                            will interest you to know that Senator Gillette has already received
                            independently at least one editorial from the <hi rend="italic">Star and
                                Herald</hi> in regard to the hearings, and presumably will receive
                            more.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in a telegram we are sending today,<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d571fn50">Telegram No. 830, October 13, 5 p.m., not
                                printed.</note> we all hope that the Panamanian press will not
                            indulge in gratuitous and unjust criticism of the United States Senate
                            because of the hearings which have taken place. Critical or provocative
                            statements from Panamanian sources might have an unfavorable effect on
                            the Senators, and prejudice prompt and favorable action.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I think it only fair to let you know that we all here
                            feel strongly that the Panamanian Government itself has by no means been
                            as helpful as it might have been in assisting us in this matter. The
                            Panamanians were informed some time ago that the question of the claims
                            was going to come up, and it was indicated to them that a helpful
                            attitude on their part would greatly assist in overcoming this obstacle.
                            All that was required, in my judgment, was a responsible statement to
                            the effect that any claims advanced by American claimants against the
                            Government of Panama would be accorded a fair hearing under Panamanian
                            law, that there was no disposition to prejudge the claims, and that in
                            the event that our Government were to present officially any claims
                            through diplomatic channels the Panamanian Government would of course be
                            willing to have such claims adjudicated in the usual way, whether by
                            arbitration or otherwise; that the question of claims of citizens of one
                            country against the Government of the other are of course separate from
                            the governmental negotiations on major matters which have taken place,
                            but that Panama is always willing to cooperate with the United States in
                            bringing about a settlement of such claims in order to remove, so far as
                            possible, all pending differences between the two countries. However,
                            instead of any helpful statement of this character, which would be in
                            the interest of Panama as much as the United States, the Government of
                            Panama has seen fit to convey the impression that it is not even willing
                            to discuss fair arbitration of these claims. Obviously such an attitude
                            makes our task here much greater than it need be, and I think the
                            Panamanian officials should be aware of this fact. I am sure that you
                            have fully appreciated the importance of the foregoing, and I know the
                            difficulties with which you have had to cope; but at the same time, if
                            things do not go as well as we now hope in the Senate, it is still not
                            too late in my judgment for a helpful statement from the Panamanian
                            Government in <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0630"/>regard to the
                            claims matter to be a contribution to the successful passage of the
                            legislation. Such a statement need not be made public. If it were
                            transmitted officially to the Department, it could be shown in
                            confidence to Senator Gillette and the Committee, and if necessary kept
                            off the record in order to avoid confusion with the legislation
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>I don’t think we should press hard for any such statement, since we are
                            not seeking any concession from Panama in this connection. It is merely
                            a question of letting them know what in our judgment is best for all of
                            us in the long run. I should be glad to have your reactions to the
                            foregoing.</p>
                        <p>With cordial regards,</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ed</hi>: I have read with interest your letter
                            of October 9 regarding the Panamanian attititude toward the proceedings
                            in the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee of Foreign Relations
                            concerning the Panamanian legislation. I feel it important to give you a
                            summary of the situation as it appears to us and of the dangers inherent
                            in a failure of the Panamanian authorities and of the Panamanian press
                            to realize this situation. I have sent you a telegram on this subject
                                today.<note n="51" xml:id="d572fn51">Telegram No. 830, October 13, 5

                        </p>
                        <p>The private claimants to whom you refer have been represented at the
                            hearings by Mr. Roy C. Hackley, an energetic attorney from San
                            Francisco, whom, I believe, you know; by former Senator King of Utah and
                            by a Mr. Walker, a lawyer in Senator King’s law firm.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hackley has attacked the proposed legislation unsoundly but
                            vigorously. Not only has he stated that it is contrary to the interests
                            of the United States Government, he has also gone at some lengths into
                            the alleged interests of the East Indian and Chinese tenants on the
                            railroad lots who, he says, are being thrown to the wolves by our
                            proposed action. He has also endeavored to make out that the
                            reversionary rights in these lots are in the Colombian Government<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d572fn52">This was based on the theory that Panama
                                did not succeed in 1903 to the reversionary rights of Colombia which
                                grew out of the terms of contracts of 1850 and 1867 between the
                                Panama Railroad Company and New Granada whereby the latter conceded
                                a 99-year lease to the former in return for the extension of the
                                railroad.</note> and that the Panamanian Government had no right to
                            transfer them to us in 1903. He has stated that the $2,500,000 lent <pb
                                n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0631"/>by the Export-Import Bank to
                            Panama for the construction of the Rio Hato Highway was in fact
                            squandered by high Panamanian officials and not devoted to highway
                            purposes at all. All of these contentions and many, many others with
                            which I will not bore you, but which you will be able to read from the
                            record have, I hope, been disproved by the Department to the
                            satisfaction of Senator Gillette, the Chairman of the Subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hackley was of course perfectly within his rights as an American
                            citizen in attacking this legislation, and the Subcommittee could not in
                            practice have refused to hear him. However, when he endeavored to
                            connect the private claims in which he is interested with the
                            legislation he found the Subcommittee less than sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate the fine cooperation which we have been steadily
                            receiving from the Government of Panama. I also feel strongly, as I know
                            that you do, that our treatment of Panama under the circumstances has
                            been extremely enlightened. On the other hand, the Panamanian record
                            regarding certain private claims which have been duly entertained by the
                            Department of State and which at one time were submitted to a Joint
                            Claims Commission, only to be rejected for jurisdictional reasons, has
                            been far from good.</p>
                        <p>Please assure our Panamanian friends that the Department’s point of view
                            regarding private claims is, so far as we can judge at the moment, the
                            view of the Senate Subcommittee. Please also use your best efforts in
                            explaining our Congressional practices to your Panamanian friends and
                            indicate to them discreetly but firmly the serious possibilities that
                            are inherent in ill-considered or hasty judgments or statements on their
                            part. The clipping which you sent me from the <hi rend="italic">Panamá
                                American</hi> of October 8 links the legislation now before the
                            Subcommittee with the Defense Sites Agreement in precisely the manner in
                            which, in our opinion, they are not connected.</p>

                        <p>926. Owing to the absence of a quorum, the only way in which the Panama
                            legislation could be passed by the House would be by unanimous consent.
                            The Department is informed that this is unobtainable since at least 6
                            Representatives have been asked by Senators who opposed the measure in
                            the Senate to object if the measure is brought out. It has,
                            consequently, been decided that it will not be brought up at this
                            session, which is scheduled to adjourn today, but that it will be the
                            first measure reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the
                            next session. The Department does not anticipate any <pb n="618"
                                xml:id="pg_618" facs="0632"/>insuperable difficulty in securing
                            passage of the measure in both Houses since the issue in the Senate has
                            already been fought out and since an ample majority remains
                            available.</p>
                        <p>The situation is being explained to the Panamanian Ambassador here and
                            you are requested to discuss it with the President and the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs. The Department is confident that they will understand
                            the political situation which has confronted the Administration here and
                            the further fact that every effort has been made in this matter. The
                            Department, of course, shares in the disappointment which the Government
                            and people of Panama will feel at this delay. It should be pointed out,
                            however, that opposition to the legislation was in no sense based upon
                            unwillingness to fulfill the legitimate aspirations of Panama, but
                            rather upon internal political factors. The measure itself was reported
                            favorably by the House Foreign Affairs Committee with no dissent. It was
                            reported favorably by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with only
                            two Senators expressing dissent. It was amended and passed by the Senate
                            with a comfortable margin, in spite of the Constitutional issue<note
                                n="53" xml:id="d573fn53">The question was raised by Senators Arthur
                                Vandenberg and Robert Taft as to why a treaty form was not used by
                                the two countries.</note> injected for political purposes and it
                            could have been passed in the House if the time factor and the lack of
                            quorum had not operated against the efforts of Administration
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>For your information, however, opponents of this legislation would be
                            quick to use any intemperate expression on the subject which might
                            appear in the Panamanian press or be given out by Panamanian officials.
                            It is important, therefore, that you do your utmost to prevent such
                            statements in the interest of the passage of the legislation. This, of
                            course, does not mean that legitimate expressions of Panamanian
                            disappointment, coupled with expressions of confidence in the ultimate
                            passage of the legislation, would be undesirable.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, keep the Department fully informed as to local
                            sentiment on this matter with particular reference to the forthcoming
                            meeting of the Panamanian National Assembly.</p>

                        <p>1059. The President asked me to call on him yesterday afternoon. He said
                            that the adjournment of Congress without the House having acted on the
                            Panamanian Legislation was a great blow to him and would undoubtedly
                            cause serious political difficulties for him. He <pb n="619"
                                xml:id="pg_619" facs="0633"/>said, however, that he wanted me to
                            know and wanted my Government to know that this would not affect in any
                            manner the policy of wholehearted cooperation on the part of his
                            Government with the United States in defense and all other matters.
                            Panama will continue to give the same complete cooperation which it has
                            given heretofore.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he hoped very much that there would be no delay
                            in submitting the Panamanian questions to the new Congress as soon as
                            the latter convenes and that he was confident that the United States
                            Government would make every appropriate effort to have this legislation
                            enacted as soon as possible. He asked me to convey to President
                            Roosevelt, to you, the Under Secretary, Mr. Bonsal and other officials
                            of the State Department his great appreciation for the efforts that were

                            my Government, I present a formal protest to Your Excellency’s
                            Government because of the surprising and inexplicable fact that, in the
                            Canal Zone, there is under way at the present time the construction of a
                            concrete building, the foundations of which already exist, intended as
                            an airport for Pan American Airways, Inc., an enterprise of a private
                            character which is devoted exclusively to commercial ends, and which has
                            nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with the use, operation, or
                            protection of the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>The construction referred to above is being carried out in a place
                            immediately adjacent to the building which now serves as an airport for
                            Pan American Airways, Inc., and in this same building is displayed a
                            drawing, officially approved by the Panama Canal Construction
                            Quartermaster, where it is indicated that such building has been <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0634"/>especially designed for Pan
                            American Airways, Inc. The building, the construction of which has
                            already been begun, will constitute a first class airport in the event
                            that it is completed, with all the characteristics of a permanent
                            building and not an airport of a temporary nature as is the one which
                            they now use.</p>
                        <p>The initiation and continuation of the construction of the building which
                            will be intended as an airport for Pan American Airways, Inc., in the
                            Canal Zone, is in open conflict with the principles which the Republic
                            of Panama has always maintained and continues to maintain, that the only
                            activities which can be carried on within the said Zone are those
                            expressly authorized by existing treaties and which are directly and
                            necessarily connected with the use, maintenance, sanitation, operation,
                            or protection of the Panama Canal; that all other activities are
                            prohibited; and that, with regard to them, the exclusive right to
                            regulate or utilize them appertains to the Republic of Panama, which is
                            the sovereign and which has granted the use of the lands which
                            constitute the Canal Zone with the above-mentioned limitations.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency’s Government must further take into account the fact
                            that, if the construction of the building to which I am referring is not
                            prevented the Republic of Panama will be unjustly injured, in express
                            violation of the terms of the General Treaty of March 2, 1936,<note
                                n="55" xml:id="d575fn55">Department of State Treaty Series No. 945,
                                or 53 Stat. (pt. 3) 1807.</note> which provides, in its third
                            article, that the Republic of Panama shall have the right to benefit by

                            Because of such conditions, it is logical and just to reach the
                            conclusion that the construction of a building of this kind cannot be
                            viewed by the Panamanian Government except as tending to destroy
                            legitimate rights of the Government and to cause serious harm to the
                            Republic of Panama with regard to the future development of commercial
                            air traffic, which is destined to be one of the principal sources of
                            wealth of the Republic and to counteract the serious disadvantage which
                            my country has suffered for lack of sea ports in territory under its
                            control.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama, in its sound intention of protecting the
                            legitimate rights of the Republic of Panama, has formulated requests on
                            previous occasions to Your Excellency’s Government in relation to the
                            problems which the Canal Zone airdromes raise for my country, which
                            requests have been disregarded for reasons which are still unknown. In
                            fact, on June 3, 1941, Dr. Carlos N. Brin, who was then Ambassador of
                            Panama in Washington, presented a formal protest<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d575fn56">Not printed.</note> to Your Excellency, in the
                            name of the Government of Panama, because of the use which is being made
                            of Canal Zone airdromes <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0635"/>by
                            certain civilian and commercial enterprises (i.e., Pan American Airways,
                            Inc.) the purposes of which, I repeat, are foreign to the defense or
                            protection of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>This protest was met by the reply of the Under Secretary of State of the
                            United States, the Honorable Sumner Welles, on August 5, 1941, in which
                            no other reason tending to justify this commercial use of that airdrome
                            by private companies was given than that these activities had been
                            carried on in the Canal Zone for some time.<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d575fn57">Mr. Welles reply indicated that the activities had
                                been carried on for 12 years without any question from Panama
                                (819.7962/51).</note> This reason, naturally, has not satisfied the
                            Government of Panama, which does not admit that its tolerance or failure
                            to protest previously can give rise to any right which might curtail the
                            rights clearly acquired by the Republic of Panama according to existent
                            treaties.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, that is, on September 17, 1941, the Ambassador of Panama in
                            Washington at that time addressed to Your Excellency Communication No.
                                D–464,<note n="58" xml:id="d575fn58">Not printed.</note> in which he
                            again expressed the inconformity of Panama with this unlawful use of the
                            Canal Zone airdromes. The following, among other things, was said in
                            this note, which has not yet been answered: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The tolerance of my Government in the face of the observance of
                                    this practice was due to the fact that the Republic of Panama

                                    aviation at that time nor experts in the technics of that
                                    branch. It tolerated the said practice only in a provisional way
                                    and not as an obligation to suffer perpetually that limitation
                                    which might have an unfavorable influence in the future, when
                                    the causes ceased which gave rise to that situation which
                                    undoubtedly is an obstacle to our progress.</p>

                                    such activity will constitute in the course of time a source of
                                    revenue and of trade with the other countries. Therefore, as it
                                    is now in a position to attend in a proper manner to the

                                    should obtain from the commercial advantages inherent in its
                                    geographical position, will also be keenly interested in

                                printed.</note> which first reported on this subject, stated my
                            opinion that what had mainly aroused the anxiety of the Panamanian
                            Government was the implication that this construction which appeared to
                            be permanent in character, was an indication that the United States
                            intended that all future commercial aviation development on the Isthmus
                            should take place within the Zone to the exclusion of such development
                            in Panama. I suggested at that time that a possible solution might be to
                            try to reach agreement with the Government of Panama on the basis that
                            the present development of the commercial airport at Albrook Field is to
                            take care of an emergency situation and would in no way be considered as
                            prejudicing the future of commercial air services on the Isthmus once
                            the present emergency had come to an end. I suggested that Panama might
                            be assured that once the existing world emergency was over, the United
                            States would be prepared to give consideration to the question of
                            whether during normal periods commercial aviation might use Panamanian
                            air fields. In other words, the suggestion was that the present status
                            be maintained during the emergency. I pointed out at the time that it
                            was of course likely that the Panamanian Government, if it should agree
                            to any such suggestion, would desire, in order that the new commercial
                            airfield in the Zone might not have the appearance of a definite
                            long-term development, that certain features be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>The Department replied by its instruction No. 43 of June 18, 1941,<note
                                n="62" xml:id="d576fn69">Not printed.</note> to the effect that it
                            was the preliminary view of the Department that the project constituted
                            no violation of the treaty of 1936; that the Department was strongly of
                            the opinion that under present emergency conditions international
                            commercial aircraft should continue to land in the Canal Zone; but that,
                            for my strictly confidential information, if at some time in the future
                            conditions seemed to warrant, the United States Government might be glad
                            to consider sympathetically the development of a Panamanian system of
                            airports. The Department then sent its note of August 5, 1941, in reply
                            to the Panamanian Embassy’s notes of June 3 and June 18<note n="63"
                                xml:id="d576fn63">None printed.</note> on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In considering this matter the following considerations occur to me: As
                            has been pointed out in various despatches (e.g. No. 19 of June 3, 1941
                            and No. 486 of January 14, 1942)<note n="64" xml:id="d576fn64">Neither
                                printed.</note> whatever Panamanian Government may be in office
                            after the war during what may be termed a “normal” period will
                            unquestionably desire to provide for the construction of a large
                            commercial airport in Panamanian territory and to have commercial air
                            lines on the Isthmus land at this Panamanian airport. The present
                            Panamanian Government fully recognizes, I <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624"
                                facs="0638"/>believe, that under war conditions it is necessary for
                            the control of commercial aviation to be exercised by our Army. Because
                            of this, and because of the fact that there is at present no airport in
                            Panamanian territory at which large air liners can land, the Panamanian
                            Government is raising no objection to the continued use by commercial
                            aviation of Albrook Field. What it does object to, however, is the
                            construction of installations having a permanent character and which
                            therefore might have the effect of prejudicing the interests of Panama
                            as regards the future development of commercial aviation on the Isthmus.
                            Panama fears that with this permanent and costly construction completed,
                            that when Panama may attempt after the war to carry out plans for the
                            construction of a commercial air field in Panamanian territory, it will
                            be met with objections from the United States Government pointing out
                            that this is unnecessary, unwise, etc., because of the existing
                            construction which has been provided by the United States Government in
                            the Canal Zone. My strictly confidential despatch No. 1003 of March 19,
                                1942,<note n="65" xml:id="d576fn65">Not printed.</note> conveys the
                            opinion of the President of Panama on this score.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to the receipt of the Department’s instruction under
                            acknowledgment, I have again conferred with General Andrews<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d576fn66">Maj. Gen. Frank M. Andrews, Commanding General,
                                Caribbean Defense Command.</note> as to the possibility that the
                            permanent administration building might be removed from the site on
                            which it is being constructed (only the foundation has been built to
                            date) and placed further to the northeast on the border of the Republic,
                            which would make it possible for passengers destined for Panama to exit
                            immediately on Panamanian territory (see page 3 of memorandum attached
                            to my despatch No. 486 of January 14, 1942. The thought was that this
                            might make this development more acceptable to Panama). After study of
                            this suggestion, General Andrews informs me that it would not be
                            possible to do this, as the area in question must be kept free of any
                            construction so that airplanes approaching the field from this direction
                            may have unimpeded access. Under this circumstance, the General
                            believes, in view of the crowded and congested conditions at the present
                            temporary administration building, that there is no other course than to
                            go ahead with the construction of the new building, which will in any
                            case, he states, be required in the future for the service of passengers
                            arriving in the Canal Zone, regardless of whether the Republic some day
                            obliges the airlines to land somewhere in the Republic passengers
                            destined for Panama.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, my suggestion is that our reply to the
                            Panamanian Embassy’s note of March 23, 1942, might take the following
                            lines: That the United States Government is unable to share the <pb
                                n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0639"/>view of the Government of
                            Panama that the use by commercial aviation companies of airports in the
                            Canal Zone violates provisions of treaties between the two countries;
                            that the United States is, of course, as always, desirous of cooperating
                            with Panama so that the latter may take advantage of the commercial
                            advantages inherent in its geographical situation; that the present
                            development of the commercial airport at Albrook Field is required only
                            in order to take care of existing traffic needs; and that this
                            development is in no way intended to modify or prejudice the situation
                            as regards the future development of commercial aviation on the
                            Isthmus.</p>
                        <p>I should like, after the Department has sent its reply to the Panamanian
                            Embassy, to have a full and frank conversation with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs on this subject. I should propose to talk with him along
                            other lines than those set out in the Department’s instruction No. 191
                            of September 5, 1941,<note n="67" xml:id="d576fn67">Not printed.</note>
                            which, as stated in my despatch No. 486 of January 14, 1942, I believe
                            do not meet the situation. My thought would be to say to the Foreign
                            Minister something as follows: That while there appears to be in this
                            question of the development of commercial aviation on the Isthmus a
                            conflict between the interests of the United States and those of Panama,
                            there is in fact no conflict that cannot be satisfactorily resolved. As
                            has occurred in so many other cases, with the exercise of patience and
                            friendly understanding, the interests of both Governments can be
                            adequately safeguarded. The Panamanian interest is primarily that of
                            obtaining the advantages in a normal period in the future of the
                            development of commercial aviation on the Isthmus. The primary United
                            States interest is the necessity of exercising adequate control over
                            aviation in this area so as to protect the Canal Zone. With the
                            tremendous development in military aviation taking place today it is
                            certain that within a year or two this Canal will be vulnerable to air
                            attack from any capital in the world by planes capable of carrying a
                            bomb-load forty or fifty times more destructive than that carried by
                            Stuka dive bombers today. What we have witnessed in the Nazi attacks on
                            Poland and the Low Countries, and in the Japanese attack on Pearl
                            Harbor, show clearly that even in any “normal” period in the future the
                            United States will have to exercise at all times effective and
                            far-reaching measures of control regarding all aviation coming to the
                            Isthmus. It would seem, however, that once this world emergency is over
                            and assuming that within any reasonable length of time the world may
                            return to what can be termed a “normal” period, it should be readily
                            possible for Panama and the United States to reach an agreement which
                            would conciliate and safeguard adequately these two primary
                            interests.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to reply to Your
                            Excellency’s note no. D–165 dated March 23, 1942 relative to the
                            erection at Albrook Field in the Canal Zone of a concrete construction
                            designed to serve as a new administration building for Pan American
                            Airways. I also refer to your predecessor’s note no. D–464 of September
                            17, 1941,<note n="69" xml:id="d577fn69">Not printed.</note> as well as
                            to previous exchanges of communications regarding aviation matters on
                            the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
                        <p>In referring to these communications I wish to restate this Government’s
                            position as expressed in its note of August 5, 1941,<note n="69"
                                xml:id="d577fn68">Not printed.</note> that the use of airdromes in
                            the Panama Canal Zone by commercial aviation companies does not
                            represent an infraction of either the spirit or the terms of any treaty
                            provisions in force between the Government of the United States and the
                            Government of the Republic of Panama. The improvements now being made at
                            Albrook Field, including the construction of a concrete administration
                            building, are essential in view of present conditions, and should in no
                            way be considered as a change in the situation which has prevailed since
                            the establishment of the existing services.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency’s recent note states that the construction of the
                            concrete building for the Pan American Airways, Incorporated, “an
                            enterprise of a private character which is devoted exclusively to
                            commercial ends”, is in open conflict with the principles of existing
                            treaties. In this connection Your Excellency’s attention is invited to
                            the provision of Executive Order No. 8974 issued by the President on
                            December 17, 1941,<note n="70" xml:id="d577fn70">6 <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Federal Register</hi> 6441.</note> by the terms of which the
                            Secretary of War is authorized and directed to take possession and
                            assume control of civil aviation systems to the extent necessary for the
                            successful prosecution of the war. Pursuant to this authority the War
                            Department on May 14, 1942, announced its program to control operations
                            of commercial airlines. It is clear, therefore, that although Pan
                            American Airways is an enterprise of a private character, it is not at
                            present devoted exclusively to commercial uses, since its services and
                            facilities <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0641"/>have been brought
                            within the program of our armed forces in the interest of the defense
                            and security of the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>The objection of Your Excellency’s Government to the construction of the
                            concrete building at Albrook Field has been brought to the attention of
                            the appropriate authorities of this Government, who state that in view
                            of the crowded and congested conditions at the present temporary
                            administration building, it is imperative that the new building be
                            completed and put into service at the earliest possible date. As Your
                            Excellency is aware, the strategic geographical location of the Isthmus
                            of Panama, the progress made in modern aerial warfare, and the recent
                            expansion of the theatre of war have made it increasingly necessary to
                            augment the system of aviation controls in order adequately to govern
                            the entry into, the navigation within, and the departure from the
                            Isthmus, of military and civil aircraft.</p>
                        <p>This Government, always interested in maintaining the best of relations
                            with Your Excellency’s Government, has in the development of the airport
                            at Albrook Field, no thought of interfering in any way with the national
                            economy of Panama or of prejudicing the sovereignty of the Republic, and
                            wishes at this time to reiterate its continued determination as
                            expressed in the Treaty of 1936 “to enable the Republic of Panama to
                            take advantage of commercial opportunities inherent in its geographical
                            situation.” The only interest which this Government has in the
                            development of the airport at Albrook Field is that of providing

                        <p>In view of the foregoing, it is felt that the Panamanian Government has
                            no justification for feeling that the completion of a new airport
                            administration building in the Canal Zone “would have the effect of
                            prejudicing, indefinitely and permanently vital interests of the
                            Republic of Panama”.</p>

                            Your Excellency’s kind communication 819.7962/68 of June 23, last, by
                            means of which you were good enough to reply to my note No. D–165 of
                            March 23 of this year, both with regard to the request made by my
                            Government arising from the advanced state of the construction of a
                            concrete building <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0642"/>which is
                            being put up in the Canal Zone and which will be meant for the new
                            airport of the Pan American Airways Inc.</p>
                        <p>In the second paragraph of Your Excellency’s note mentioned above, Your
                            Excellency says in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In referring to your communications I wish to reiterate the
                                    position of this Government, as expressed in its note of August
                                    5, 1941, that the use of airdromes in the Panama Canal Zone by
                                    commercial aviation companies does not represent an infraction
                                    of the spirit or of the text of any of the stipulations of the
                                    treaties in force between the Government of the United States
                                    and the Government of the Republic of Panama.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>Allow me to state to Your Excellency that your assertion goes much beyond
                            the immediate point in discussion as to whether the building which is
                            now being constructed for the Pan American Airways, Inc. is primarily
                            for commercial or military purposes. This is a question of fact which I
                            am taking the liberty of commenting on later. But before starting upon
                            such a commentary, I must indicate my Government’s non-acquiescence in
                            the general assertion which I have just quoted, which maintains the
                            legality, on the part of the United States, of the operation of
                            commercial aviation in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>Such a proposal is, as I have already said, in conflict with the
                            stipulations of existing treaties, with the very nature of the Canal
                            Zone and with the fundamental rights of the Panamanian nation.</p>
                        <p>No further analysis of the treaties of November 18, 1903 and March 2,
                            1936 is needed to come to the conviction that, under them, only
                            activities having to do with the construction, protection, maintenance,
                            sanitation and defense of the Panama Canal are authorized within the
                            Canal Zone. In addition to being the fundamental spirit of both
                            agreements, this is expressly declared in the General Treaty of March 2,
                            1936, when it is stated that, with the exception of such activities, the
                            United States of America “<hi rend="italic">will not permit the
                                establishment in the Canal Zone of private business enterprises
                                other than those existing therein at the time of the signature of
                                this Treaty</hi>.”</p>
                        <p>With respect to any other activity different from those mentioned, it is
                            clearly understood that Panama is the only power called upon to engage
                            in them or authorize them. This proposition is so clear that no
                            reasoning seems necessary to maintain it. The said treaty of March 2
                            already cited establishes, as I have stated before, that one of the
                            purposes of that treaty (article 3) is “to enable the Republic of Panama
                            to take advantage of the commercial opportunities inherent in its
                            geographical situation.”</p>
                        <p>With matters thus, my Government cannot agree to the general declaration
                            that the Government of the United States can authorize the use of
                            airdromes in the Canal Zone by commercial aviation companies without
                            violating the aforesaid agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0643"/>
                        <p>This proposition, one with great scope at present, but with still greater
                            scope for the future, entails a serious injury to the future economy of
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>If through the natural development of modern aviation, commercial
                            aviation has become, and will be tomorrow, a source of constantly
                            increasing economic wealth, it is obvious that the enjoyment of this
                            situation corresponds exclusively to the Republic of Panama for the
                            reasons set forth.</p>
                        <p>In note No. 819.7062/68, Your Excellency states that Pan American
                            Airways, Inc. should not at present be considered as a company engaged
                            solely in commercial activities, since the services and facilities which
                            it is furnishing have been subordinated to military interest and
                            control, decreed by the War Department under date of May 14, 1942 in
                            behalf of defense. Your Excellency also states that, as a result of the
                            congestion at present existing in the building where the management of
                            this company is temporarily located at Albrook Field, it is imperative
                            for it to use a new building of larger size, a need which also exists in
                            view of the progress of modern air warfare, which makes it necessary to
                            increase the system of air control of military and civilian aviation
                            over the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
                        <p>My Government assumes that Your Excellency wished to refer to air control
                            over the Panama Canal, since in the case of air control over the
                            remainder of the Republic of Panama, such control would devolve
                            exclusively upon the Government of Panama, which would be the one to
                            order the pertinent measures or to be consulted in advance with respect
                            to any advisable measures which should be ordered jointly by Panama and
                            the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama recognizes that the present emergency requires
                            an expansion of the existing conditions [<hi rend="italic"
                                >facilities?</hi>]<note n="71" xml:id="d578fn71">Brackets appear in
                                the file translation.</note> at the airdrome at Albrook Field and
                            also admits that, at present, the Government of Panama cannot offer an
                            airport in first-class condition for use by the continent’s commercial
                            aviation. My Government also recognizes the fact that the needs and
                            dangers of the present war require extraordinary measures of expansion,
                            watchfulness and control as respects air activities which might endanger
                            the defense of the Panama Canal. As respects those necessities, my
                            Government does not wish to interpose any obstacle, my Government having
                            always been the first to give the most active and effective cooperation
                            in the common defense of the Panama Canal, the American continent and
                            the noble and just cause of the United Nations, in which Panama appears
                            as a military ally.</p>
                        <p>But my Government has found reason for the representations made both in
                            my note No. D–165 of March 23, 1942 and in the present note precisely in
                            the circumstance that the new building under construction, <pb n="630"
                                xml:id="pg_630" facs="0644"/>which will replace the present airport
                            of the Pan American Airways at Albrook Field, is a building which has
                            all the appearance of a permanent construction and not of a temporary
                            erection intended solely to meet needs resulting from the present war
                            emergency. If it were a building belonging to the Government of the
                            United States itself, devoted to military purposes, or if it were a
                            building which, although for the exclusive use of the Pan American
                            Airways System, was of a temporary character and designed solely for the
                            present emergency, then my Government would find no reason for
                            apprehension but rather, on the contrary, would be ready once more to
                            declare its intention to cooperate in the common interest of defense.
                            But as it is a concrete structure, with all the signs of a permanent
                            construction, built on the instructions of the Government of the United
                            States and exclusively for the use of the Pan American Airways, Inc., a
                            company which normally engages in private operation of commercial
                            aviation, my Government cannot but be decidedly apprehensive, and must
                            proceed clearly to repeat its non-acquiescence and its confidence that
                            Your Excellency’s worthy Government will make categoric statements which
                            will assure the Government of Panama that Panama’s commercial future
                            will not be injured through the commercial operation of aviation in the
                            Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting the pleasure of a reply from Your Excellency, I take pleasure in

                            Panamanian Ambassador in Washington in reply to the latter’s note of
                            March 23, 1942. Dr. Fábrega said that he was not impressed with the
                            argument in the Department’s note to the effect that since the War
                            Department had assumed control of civil aviation systems, Pan American
                            Airways had in effect been removed from the <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631"
                                facs="0645"/>category of an enterprise of private character devoted
                            exclusively to commercial ends. Dr. Fábrega said, furthermore, that he
                            thought the Department’s note left the whole question about where it was
                            before.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that there was no question but that Pan American Airways,
                            together with other heretofore private commercial air systems which had
                            been brought under the control of the Secretary of War, was being used
                            principally for purposes related to the prosecution of the war.
                            Furthermore, I said that frankly it seemed to me that the Department’s
                            note ought to be satisfactory to the Panamanian Government: The note
                            states that the construction taking place at Albrook Field is essential
                            in view of present congested conditions and should in no way be
                            considered as a change in the situation which has prevailed since the
                            establishment of existing services. Further, the note states that the
                            United States Government has had, in the development of the airport at
                            Albrook Field, no thought of interfering with the national economy of
                            Panamá or prejudicing the sovereignty of the Republic. The note
                            reiterates the declaration of the Treaty of 1936 about enabling Panamá
                            to take advantage of opportunities inherent in its geographical
                            situation, and states that the only interest which the United States
                            Government has in the development of the airport at Albrook Field is
                            that of providing adequate protection for the Panama Canal. I said that
                            it seemed to me that these statements were reasonable and sound, and I
                            could not see any cause for Panamá to take exception to them, nor,
                            indeed, to have any apprehension in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Fábrega went on to say that he was pessimistic regarding the economic
                            future of Panamá, insofar as this might be based upon activities in the
                            Canal Zone related to the passage of vessels through the Canal. He said
                            that with the phenomenal development in aviation, it would probably be a
                            matter of only a short time before much of the cargo heretofore
                            transported in ships through the Canal would be carried by air. It
                            occurred to him, he said, that when because of this development receipts
                            from the Canal should fall off, there might be a temptation for the
                            United States in the post-war period, when retrenchment and economy
                            would probably become the order of the day, to seek to recoup the losses
                            from Canal tolls by insisting that the augmented air services continue
                            to use Canal Zone facilities and pay fees to the United States. He said
                            that, furthermore, it was not at all sure that the increased air
                            transportation services of the future would continue to use the Isthmus
                            as a central junction point, as is being done at present. Panamá must,
                            however, maintain intact its rights to profit economically from the
                            development of air transportation in the future insofar as facilities on
                            the Isthmus might be used by commercial air companies. He reiterated
                            that he feared that <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0646"/>with this
                            large permanent construction at Albrook Field, there would be a great
                            temptation for the United States, once the war is over, to put obstacles
                            in the way of Panamá’s developing its own national airfield and having
                            commercial lines use that field.</p>
                        <p>I said that I could not agree with him that there was any just cause for
                            apprehension that the United States Government would in the future,
                            because of economic reasons, attempt to evade its commitments to Panamá.
                            We had declared in the 1936 Treaty, and now reiterated, that we wished
                            to see Panamá have advantage of the commercial opportunities inherent in
                            its geographical situation. Furthermore, the only interest of the United
                            States in the development of the airport at Albrook Field is, as stated
                            in the Department’s note, that of providing adequate protection for the
                            Canal. I said that it seemed to me that there was no reason whatsoever
                            why the Panamanian interest in this question, which is that of obtaining
                            advantages in the future from the development of commercial aviation on
                            the Isthmus, should not be reconciled with the United States interest,
                            which is that of exercising adequate control over aviation in this area
                            so as to protect the Canal. I said that it seemed to me these two
                            interests, instead of being in conflict, were actually complementary.
                            The development in aviation, accelerated by the war, concerning which
                            Dr. Fábrega had spoken, would mean that within a brief period the Canal
                            would be vulnerable to air attack from any capital in the world by
                            planes carrying bomb loads vastly more destructive than any known today.
                            With the experience gained in this war as regards treacherous surprise
                            attacks, it will obviously be necessary for the United States in the
                            future, even in any so-called “normal” period, to exercise at all times
                            effective measures of control regarding aviation coming to the Isthmus.
                            But there was no reason that I could see why such measures of control
                            could not be reconciled with the obtaining by Panamá of the economic
                            advantages which might accrue from the development of commercial
                            aviation in this area.</p>
                        <p>As Dr. Fábrega had mentioned the construction in the future of a national
                            airport in the vicinity of the City of Panamá, I said that it seemed to
                            me personally that the military necessities for the protection of the
                            Canal in a “normal” period would be served by an agreement that all
                            commercial planes coming to the Isthmus would be under the control of
                            the United States military authorities as to identifying themselves and
                            as to routes they would follow, and that they would first land at
                            Albrook Field for discharge of passengers and freight for the Canal
                            Zone; cleared by the military authorities they could then take off and
                            at the Panamanian National Airport, a few miles distant, would land
                            passengers and freight destined for the Republic. Dr. Fábrega did not
                            comment on the foregoing. He said that he agreed with me that with good
                            will and patience it should be <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0647"
                            />possible to work out an agreement in the future, once the war is over,
                            which should protect adequately the two primary interests involved.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Your
                            Excellency’s note no. D–571 dated August 4, 1942 and previous
                            correspondence relative to the erection at Albrook Field in the Canal
                            Zone of a concrete construction designed to serve as a new
                            administration building for Pan American Airways.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to note that Your Excellency’s Government is fully cognizant
                            that the needs and dangers arising out of the present world crisis
                            require extraordinary measures of watchfulness and control over air
                            activities which might endanger the defenses of the Panama Canal, and
                            that it does not wish to place any obstacle in the way of essential or
                            required improvements of the airdrome at Albrook Field. My Government
                            appreciates this expression of the friendly attitude of the Government
                            of Panama and fully realizes, as Your Excellency has stated, that the
                            Republic has given most active and effective cooperation in matters
                            relating to the defense of the Panama Canal, the American Hemisphere and
                            the cause of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Although no one can be sure of what the post war situation may be with
                            respect to the development of commercial aviation, the Commanding
                            General of the Caribbean area believes that a permanent administration
                            building at Albrook Field will always be necessary as a measure of
                            military preparedness. He has stated that this will be the case
                            irrespective of whatever measures the Panamanian authorities may wish to
                            take with respect to the construction of a national airport. To me this
                            appears to be a reasonable and sound statement and I am unable to see
                            why the Panamanian Government need have any apprehension over the
                            erection of a permanent administration building at Albrook Field. As
                            Your Excellency is no doubt aware, this building is a project sponsored
                            and supervised by the War Department and financed by the Government of
                            the United States to meet additional needs brought about by the war.</p>
                        <p>The Department has once more given careful consideration to the
                            statements contained in Your Excellency’s note of August 4 relating to
                            the possible applicability of existing treaty provisions to the matter
                            under discussion. However, the same conclusion has been reached as
                            previously set forth, particularly in the Department’s notes of August
                            5, 1941<note n="74" xml:id="d580fn74">Not printed.</note> and June 23,
                            1942 to the Ambassador of Panama at <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634"
                                facs="0648"/>Washington, to the effect that the provisions of the
                            Treaty of 1936 between our two countries are not infringed by the
                            construction of the administration building at Albrook Field. As I am
                            sure Your Excellency’s Government will readily agree, this Government
                            not only intends but has endeavored in every practical way to comply
                            strictly with both the spirit and the letter of this Treaty and of the
                            agreements supplementary thereto.</p>

                            into commitment with Panamanian Government to purchase entire production
                            of rubber in Panama except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon)
                            necessary for domestic consumption, at price of thirty-five cents per
                            pound c. &amp; f. United States continental port for usual good quality
                            Castilloa rubber as understood in New York, with appropriate
                            differentials for other grades. The term of the agreement would be for 5
                            years, unless sooner terminated by mutual consent. The Government of
                            Panama would agree to restrict export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company
                            or its nominees. The exportation of manufactured rubber, if any, would
                            be restricted to the United States. Panama would agree to use its best
                            efforts to cause maximum amount of rubber to be produced and made
                            available for sale to Reserve. Local labor would be financed locally for
                            necessities for collecting rubber. Some governmental agency, if
                            desirable, would be designated as the single buying agency, otherwise
                            sales would be made through usual trade channels now in existence. Price
                            on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as local sales price.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing proposal corresponds generally to agreements entered into with
                            Brazilian Government on March 3.<note n="76" xml:id="d581fn76">See

                            and referred it to the Banco Agropecuario for examination and
                            recommendation as to price. The Minister said that the Government had
                            already offered certain local rubber producers a price higher than that
                            proposed by the United States. He will advise me further as soon as the

                            of 35 cents per pound in New York offered by Rubber Reserve is not
                            sufficient to stimulate the production and gathering of rubber in this
                            country but that price of 40 cents per pound in Panama would stimulate
                            production and extraction.</p>

                                >George L. Seeley, rubber expert, Office of the Coordinator of
                                Inter-American Affairs.</note> have looked into the question of
                            costs in getting rubber out under present conditions but find it
                            practically impossible to establish as there has been no rubber
                            gathering in Panama for more than 20 years and no data available
                            regarding costs. Owners of old and abandoned rubber plantations of which
                            there are a number say they are willing to undertake extraction but do
                            not want to lose money.</p>
                        <p>And in considering statement in Department’s instruction number 249 that
                            price offered to Panama is the same as that made to other producing
                            countries for same type of rubber and Luedtke and Seeley feel that in
                            view of the high wage scale and scarcity of labor in Panama some
                            additional inducement will have to be made if rubber extraction in
                            Panama is to be stimulated.</p>

                            (1) contract will be signed by bank on behalf of Government of Panama,
                            (2) right of export not “exclusive” as in our paragraph two but bank’s
                            paragraph three provides that bank agrees that all rubber produced is to
                            be sold to agency, (3) bank’s draft includes a new paragraph providing
                            that reserve obligates itself to receive (up to) 240 tons of rubber and
                            return equivalent amount of manufactured products within 4 months of
                            bank’s delivery of rubber, (4) price is made delivered bank’s warehouse

                        <p>A–131. My 800, July 23, 4 p.m.<note n="91" xml:id="d588fn91">Not
                                printed.</note> A last minute hitch has arisen in connection with
                            negotiations for rubber agreement which is most unfortunate. Apodaca has
                            been here twice on this matter, seeking to find a compromise on the
                            question of price to be paid by Reserve. Two feasible formulas were
                            submitted by him to Reserve for clearance both of which we had reason to
                            believe would be acceptable to Panama. This presumably had settled the
                            last remaining point of difference and we were hoping to arrange this
                            afternoon for signature of agreement. In telephone conversation however
                            which Apodaca has just had with Bicknell latter insisted that the bank
                            must not pay a higher price than 33 cents internally for rubber
                            purchased within the Republic of Panama. This is a complete surprise to
                            us, since our telegram no. 707, June 27, 11 a.m.<note n="91"
                                xml:id="d588fn95">Not printed.</note> stated specifically that the
                            plan of the bank was to pay rubber producers a price sufficiently
                            attractive to stimulate production, the bank paying difference between
                            33 cents received from Rubber Reserve and any higher price paid
                            producers by bank, this difference to be absorbed by Government and
                            recovered from price paid by purchaser for rubber tires and products.
                            The Embassy’s telegram No. 756, July 6, 8 p.m. referred specifically to
                            No. 707, June 27 and in answer thereto the Department in its telegram
                            No. 694, July 21, 10 p.m. stated that draft was satisfactory subject to
                            two points which made no reference to question of internal price.<note

                            July 30 explaining in detail the plan of the bank to pay to producers an
                            initial price of 40 cents per pound and to make up the difference by
                            charging higher prices on finished rubber goods. Rubber Reserve
                            presumably after receiving foregoing letter replied to Apodaca at San
                            José in Department’s No. 334, August 10, 11 p.m.<note n="91"

                        <p>In telephone conversation today Bicknell stated that bank’s

                                be used as the standard (811.20 Defense (M)/7651).</note> was
                            acceptable provided price paid to producers in Panama by bank would be
                            no higher than 33 cents. He stated, furthermore, that Reserve and Board
                            of Economic Warfare did not favor the charging of higher prices for
                            manufactured rubber goods since an effort was made to supply goods to
                            all Latin American countries and every attempt is made to see that
                            ultimate consumers in Latin America do not pay exorbitant prices for
                            goods supplied by United States.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that if the United States Government is really interested
                            in the one essential aspect of this matter, namely that of getting
                            rubber for the war effort, it is no concern of ours what Panama pays
                            internally to the producers of rubber or what price Panama sets for
                            finished rubber goods, provided we get the crude rubber at a price
                            satisfactory to us. In order to speed up action on this rubber agreement
                            I have recently spoken with the President and members of the Cabinet,
                            and as a result the negotiations on the agreement from Panama’s side
                            have been placed in the hands of the Minister of Agriculture,<note
                                n="94" xml:id="d588fn94">Ernesto Fbrega.</note> who is doing
                            everything possible to conclude the negotiations without further loss of
                            time. It is, however, utterly useless for us to go back to Panama and
                            attempt to dictate to them what they are to pay producers in the country
                            or what price they are to set on finished goods. The responsible
                            officials of the Government of Panama are convinced that in order to get
                            rubber out of the interior they will have to pay producers 40 cents or
                            more a pound. It is a matter of common knowledge that wage scales are
                            considerably higher in Panama, due to the Canal Zone and demand for
                            labor there, than they are in any of the neighboring countries. The only
                            way that Panama can accept our price of 33 cents is to pay producers the
                            price which will bring the rubber out.</p>
                        <p>I recommend strongly that Apodaca be authorized to sign the agreement on
                            the basis of the draft already submitted to the Department as amended in
                            two particulars, first, paragraph 6 to be so worded as to permit the
                            bank to pay producers a higher price than the fixed price; and second,
                            the fixed price to be 33 cents on dock Panama ocean ports.</p>

                        <p>“Spent yesterday in Panama. After talking with Apodaca and getting views
                            of the Ambassador am thoroughly convinced we cannot reach an agreement
                            with Panama unless we recognize the fact that Panama can pay any price
                            she wishes for rubber produced domestically so long as she sells to
                            Reserve at 33 cents. Full assurance has been given by bank that they
                            will maintain premium payments internally not only to stimulate
                            production of 240 tons necessary for domestic needs but for all possible
                            production. Careful estimates indicate production of approximately 568
                            tons which means that their plan will require an average of only $1.60
                            per tire increase in price. Panama officials feel they have complete
                            right to pay their producers what they wish for crude rubber and to sell
                            imported rubber goods at prices determined by Panama.</p>
                        <p>Understand Board of Economic Warfare objects to higher charge for tires
                            to Panamanian consumers. Let’s be realistic! This is strictly a domestic
                            economic and political problem not for determination by us. Ambassador
                            and Apodaca believed you had recognized this right of Panama since no
                            objection had been received to cables setting forth bank’s plan nor did
                            your reply to bank’s counter proposal indicate objection to internal
                            premium payments of which you had been forewarned.</p>
                        <p>Only other issue relates to point of delivery at 33 cents and Apodaca has
                            offered two formulas that assure agreement.</p>
                        <p>Though everybody here realizes this is not ideal, it is the best
                            practical solution of a difficult situation and I strongly recommend
                            that you authorize Apodaca to sign at once.”</p>

                                but message received from Apodaca on August 4 from Costa Rica
                                created new misunderstanding on our part because it appeared to
                                indicate that the difference between the 33 cent price and the 40
                                cent price would be taken care of not through the employment of a
                                double price system but through expenditures from the Development
                                Fund. This is recounted to you just by way of explanation.</item>

                            <item>All agencies here are of the opinion that we should, if possible,
                                seek better means of dealing with difficulty than the double price
                                system proposed which appears susceptible of great misunderstanding.
                                We have carefully reviewed the alternatives. First, we might agree
                                to a higher price for Panamanian crude rubber on the basis of facts
                                outlined in your letter to Feis. This of course might have
                                repercussions in other producing countries which we desire to avoid
                                if possible. Second, we might be able to compensate for the higher
                                Panamanian costs through use of the Development Fund. The Fund
                                might, for instance, be used to pay unusually high transportation
                                costs, to make supplies needed in production available at low
                                prices, as well as food and medical supplies. This seems to us the
                                most satisfactory alternative and it is suggested that you, with the
                                assistance of Apodaca should see whether a solution along this line,
                                is not satisfactory to the Panamanian Government possibly providing
                                for the payment of 33 cents f.o.b. dock as well as expenditures from
                                the Fund. We recognize the special cost situation in Panama and are
                                ready to consider any satisfactory immediate solution. We greatly
                                appreciate the personal attention you have given to the
                                matter.</item>

                            meeting this morning with the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of

                            solution on the basis indicated in the letter: It appears that there are
                            only about 5 tons of rubber involved which were purchased at 35 cents a
                            pound.</p>

                        <p>84. Under a new contract entered into between the War Department and Pan

                        <p>Since it is now well known throughout the American republics that the
                            airport development work of Pan American under the original program was
                            financed by this Government, and in view of the changed situation, it is
                            believed that such negotiations as may be required with the Paraguayan
                            Government should be conducted by this Government rather than through
                            Pan American Airways as was done in the first program. If, in the case
                            of Paraguay, no further permissions or negotiations are necessary, it
                            presumably will be sufficient for you to notify the Paraguayan
                            Government that the construction work will be undertaken soon and at the

                        <p>Dr. Argaña, who has recently taken a strong position in favor of the

                        <p>161. Department’s No. 84, March 23, 8 p.m. Argaña has been trying to
                            secure clearance for airport improvement and has twice referred me to
                            the Minister of War,<note n="3" xml:id="d595fn3">Brig. Gen. Vicente
                                Machuca.</note> the latter has finally taken documentary file on the
                            matter away from air force and general staff and under President’s<note

                            drafting clause regarding exclusive rights sought by Pan American. Some
                            adjustment of latter’s existing and future position is regarded as
                            necessary, Pan American Airways alleging that Paraguayan Government
                            schemes to take field over and make it free national airport for all
                            classes of companies and traffic with no safeguarding of Panair’s
                            rights. Minister of War promises action and I offered to intervene
                            informally to secure arrangement with Panair. He states and so does
                            Argaña that there is no reason why the work should not proceed prior to
                            the adjustment mentioned but they seem uneasy and I rather share their
                            feeling that the Panair aspect should be cleared up. I think they are
                            now anxious to close the matter immediately.</p>

                        <p>123. Your 161, April 21, 4 p.m. The War Department has reached an
                            agreement with Pan American Airways whereby Pan American Airways grants
                            the use of airports constructed with United States Government funds to
                            United States public aircraft and certified United States civil aircraft
                            for the duration of the present emergency. The Department believes that
                            phraseology such as the following, to which Young of PAA has agreed, in
                            whatever contract may be necessary between the Paraguayan Government and
                            Pan American Airways, will be desirable both from the point of view of
                            Paraguay and the United States: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The use of the airport shall be restricted to airlines owned,

                        <p>225. Department’s No. 84 March 23, 8 p.m. Foreign Minister summoned me
                            today and in presence of Minister of War informed me that Cabinet voted
                            unanimously yesterday to authorize immediate airfield improvement work
                            on condition of 20-year contract instead of 30 years. This was based on
                            terms opened by Panair agent here as per my despatch No. 473 of March
                            28, 1942. Foreign Minister promised a written communication
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>I trust Panair may instruct its agent at once that this is satisfactory.

                        <p>230. My No. 225, May 22, 9 p.m. Minister of War today stated that
                            authorization air field applies to only Asunción, as Panair has
                            submitted no petition respecting Concepción. He requests immediate
                            formulation of request for Concepción, taking into account that the
                            field there is and must remain a military field.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to request that Panair be at once directed to instruct
                            its representative at Asunción immediately to submit proposal for
                            Concepción. Engineer Somers should be placed in position to operate
                            simultaneously as to both fields. I should appreciate telegraphic
                            instruction as to whether the Department takes such action.</p>
                        <p>Military Attaché has prepared following suggestions regarding Concepción
                            field which have my full endorsement.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“(1) Panair to [apparent omission] field, make any necessary

                            <p>(2) Panair to pay for additional land, but land will be obtained by
                                Government condemnation proceedings and Government will retain
                                ownership and title. (If Panair feels price is too high, it may
                                withdraw from the whole deal).</p>
                            <p>(3) In return for above, Panair be granted free use of field for 20
                                years. At end of period the whole passes to the Government and
                                Panair gets first refusal to rent.</p>

                                paragraph [1] may be added in appropriate places: (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) Panair maintain field’s landing facilities for public
                                and military use. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In return Panair will
                                have right control all civilian use of the field, under supervision
                                of the military commander. Planes of Paraguayan registry will have
                                free use of landing facilities, others will pay such fee as may be
                                determined by Panair in agreement with military.</p>
                            <p>The above arrangements are suggested to meet the presumptive view of

                        <p>234. My 233, May 28, 7 p.m. Paraguayan Government is prepared to modify
                            article 9 of air field contract so that first phrase will read as
                            follows “The General Aeronautics Administration shall be able to utilize
                            the airport in such cases and during such time as may be necessary,”
                            This change was worked out by me with Argaña to make clear the
                            intermittent and non-definitive character of the Paraguayan Government’s
                            utilization of the field.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Department’s telegram no. 123, April 28, 9 p.m.,
                            Paraguayan Government will insert in the contract the phraseology
                            suggested by the Department if there be added to it the following “while
                            the present international emergency continues, after the disappearance
                            of which there will be concerted new bases or conditions for the
                            utilization of the air field by non-American companies or citizens”.
                            Non-American signifies non-Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to recommend acceptance of contract as offered by the
                            Paraguayan Government with the above changes. Contract for Concepción
                            Field would be immediately granted on same general terms, allowing for
                            fact that it will be a military field. Please telegraph at earliest
                            convenience as contract must be approved by Council of State which meets
                            June 2 and June 5.</p>

                        <p>170. Your 234, May 29, noon. The Department does not consider acceptable
                            the phraseology proposed by the Paraguayan Government in the second
                            paragraph of your telegram under reference. There is no assurance that
                            when the “international emergency” disappears it will be consistent with
                            the safety and security of the Hemisphere to facilitate aviation
                            activities in the Hemisphere by non-American companies or citizens. The
                            Department strongly urges that the formula contained in the Department’s
                            123, April 23 [<hi rend="italic">28</hi>], 9 p.m., be used without

                        <p>Your 230, May 27; 233, May 28; and 236, May 29, 1 p.m. This Government
                            considers it important that the decree contain no language that would
                            operate to give Pan American exclusive rights of a nature which would
                            conflict with our agreement with Pan American as described in the
                            Department’s 123, April 23 [<hi rend="italic">28</hi>], 1942 and
                            believes that this result will be best accomplished by a specific
                            provision in the decree that the field may be used by United States
                            publicly owned or duly registered privately owned aircraft and aircraft
                            operated for the United States Government under contract and by any
                            other aircraft authorized by the United States Government and Paraguayan
                            Government. Such reasonable landing fees or charges as Paraguayan laws
                            or regulations may require will be paid by all aircraft using the field
                            except for United States and Paraguayan Government owned aircraft which
                            would of course use the field without payment of fees or charges.</p>

                        <p>258. Department’s no. 170, June 5, 3 p.m. The Department’s attitude was
                            discussed by me with the Foreign Minister on June 8 and 10 and by him at
                            subsequent Cabinet meetings.</p>
                        <p>I also conversed extensively with Finance Minister. Tonight I have
                            received formal memorandum to the following purport. The phraseology
                            discussed in Department’s first paragraph is too absolute <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0665"/>and categoric to be acceptable except
                            during emergency importing most grave and unnecessary restriction, which
                            may well be deemed derogatory to national sovereignty especially when it
                            is a condition advanced from a foreign source. The Paraguayan Government
                            insists on addition of language already proposed.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Department’s second paragraph the memorandum considers that
                            the reference to planes belonging to, registered in, operating for, or
                            authorized by the United States, excluding mention of any other American
                            country, will suggest to the humblest intelligence that the usufruct of
                            a portion of Paraguayan territory will be in reality conceded to a
                            foreign government and not to a private enterprise. The Paraguayan
                            Government deems best, particularly in view of the provisions of article
                            18 and of clause 13 of article 76 in the national constitution of August
                            15, 1940, to accord any concession on such matters to a commercial
                            concern rather than to a government. It regards the terms of article 9
                            of the projected decree law transmitted by my no. 233 of May 28, 7 p.m.
                            with the modification suggested in my telegram 234, May 29, noon and air

                            if this is not acceptable it offers the following in substitution of
                            proposal in second paragraph of Department’s instruction under

                            Privately I am assured they will gladly give us the privileges asked,
                            but do not desire these to figure in the contract.</p>
                        <p>On the first of the two points Paraguay wishes to insure herself a great
                            national [airport?] for universal use. On the second she has to consider
                            Argentina and preserve the principle that the concession is not from one
                            government to another but from a sovereign government to a private
                            foreign concern. If the terms indicated grants to a foreign concern the
                            negotiations would require completely new examination and the Paraguayan
                            Army would endeavor to have the airport constructed at an interior
                            point.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>On the first point I have the impression that some compromise might still
                            be reached, such as a proposal that the post-war negotiations should not
                            relate to planes of countries with which Paraguay has broken relations.
                            On the second point any modification seems doubtful.</p>
                        <p>If the Department decides to renew its attitude on the points there may
                            be anticipated protracted negotiations, and the question of whether
                            Panair should continue as the party in interest will arise. The
                            negotiations might or might not be aided by the withdrawal now of the
                            eight engineers of Panair waiting here for some time past who have
                            become very restive. This withdrawal might cause the impression that
                            Paraguay may really lose the opportunity of having the two airports
                            constructed, particularly as the progress of the war indicates that they
                            are even less likely than formerly to be needed for hemispheric defense.
                            On the other hand since the Government feels very strongly on the matter
                            of its sovereignty and has had difficulty with its army and Argentina on
                            the entire question it would be apt to feel that a strong attitude by us
                            on the points would be both exigent and lacking in comprehension.</p>

                            at the same time to avoid an arrangement by which a particular United
                            States carrier has a monopoly for the use of an airport constructed with
                            funds of this Government. As you are aware, the principal consideration
                            which has led this Government to undertake airport construction in
                            Paraguay is the desire to assist Paraguay in a constructive development
                            of public benefit.</p>

                                >Not printed. In August, construction on the airport at Asuncin was
                                halted because of action by the Paraguayan cavalry in preventing use
                                of military-reservation land which had been designated as part of
                                the airport. Correspondence regarding this difficulty is not
                                printed.</note> In view of the difficulties that have arisen the
                            Department is not prepared at this time to assure prompt completion of
                            the Asunción airport in accordance with the original contract,
                            particularly since the engineers assigned to the work have departed and
                            there is a pressing need for their services on other similar and more
                            urgent projects.</p>
                        <p>Should the Paraguayan Ambassador approach the Department as indicated in
                            your despatch, he will be informed that the Department will reconsider
                            the resumption of work on the airport at such time as all possibility of
                            further difficulties is removed.</p>
                        <p>As previously indicated, neither the Department nor the War Department
                            consider the Asunción airport a necessary project at this time and its
                            construction was started only to comply with the Paraguayan Government’s
                            request. In view of the action by the Paraguayan army which has delayed
                            the work on the airport, the Department does not feel that any
                            obligation exists to resume work immediately. You should refrain from
                            giving the Paraguayan Government any indication that the Department
                            desires to resume construction.</p>

                        <p>157. Referring to my despatch no. 535 of April 10<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d608fn13">Not printed.</note> Foreign Minister<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d608fn14">L. Argaa.</note> on April 17 requested me orally
                            with approval of President Morínigo to invite United States to send an
                            economic survey mission to Paraguay similar to that now functioning in
                            Bolivia. In response to my suggestion he promised to instruct Ambassador
                            Velázquez by <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0669"/>airmail leaving
                            April 19 to deliver same invitation at Washington. Nevertheless Argaña
                            insisted that I convey the request likewise. He promised to address me
                            in writing but I doubt if he will do so until there is some indication
                            from Washington of a favorable attitude toward request. The
                            apprehensiveness and sensitiveness here as to possible rebuffs
                            phenomenal. I earnestly hope that the Department can afford prompt
                            reassurance and acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Early arrival of economic mission seems especially important because of
                            what we have already done in other countries watched by Paraguay. She
                            feels that her lack of key materials accounts for relative lack of
                            interest of Washington in her problems and that if our friendship is
                            genuine we should be as helpful in a poor country as in one with many
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>I also hope that some official of the Department can be assigned to
                            assist Velázquez daily and in detail until arrangements for $900,000
                            credits and if possible some other immediate project are actually
                            completed and announced. The fear has been expressed to me by Cabinet
                            Ministers and I personally share it that he is not sufficiently
                            practical and aggressive to get prompt results in Washington under
                            present conditions there. Prompt results are urgently desirable for a
                            multitude of political reasons here.</p>

                            been endeavoring to advance the negotiations for economic assistance to
                            Paraguay. It was less than 3 weeks ago, however, that the Ambassador
                            presented his memorandum<note n="19" xml:id="d610fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> indicating what Paraguay wanted. Upon entering into
                            the negotiations I found that the Ambassador had no knowledge whatsoever
                            of the existing credits which had been offered to the Paraguayan
                            Government on mandioca processing, port works, and other public works

                            surprised me very much and makes me wonder whether the very real

                            the last 6 months is known in Governmental circles to say nothing of to
                            the general public. I confess to a feeling that what we have offered to
                            do has not produced in Paraguay the favorable repercussions that were to
                            be expected.</p>
                        <p>During the time which I have had the Ambassador’s memorandum on economic
                            assistance I had no word from you which would indicate that there was

                            now appears to have come to a head. I must ask you, therefore, to keep
                            me fully informed hereafter by telegram of all significant occurrences
                            affecting Paraguay’s internal and international situation. Had you

                                    to the cooperative program the amount of $1,000,000. At the

                        <p>195. For the Under Secretary. In reply your 129, May 4, 6 p.m.; and
                            Department’s 131, May 4, 8 p.m. Argaña asks me inform you that Paraguay
                            accepts both the four sanitary and the four agricultural experts. A
                            defense mission to recommend projects would have been more agreeable and
                            the acceptance of the experts is based on hope that they will serve in
                            good part to frame and support Paraguayan plans for more loans.
                            Velazquez telegram published here included statement that 3,000,000
                            credit was opened “without prejudice to consideration of greater aid in
                            future.” I should appreciate your comment on my strong recommendation
                            that loans to Paraguay should be made on a generous discount basis.
                            These people are well aware that their chances of really developing
                            industries and wealth are much worse than Bolivia’s and it [apparent

                            doubtful of being able to carry. I hope Department will take as
                            realistic a view as War Department did regarding Lend-Lease

                                <item>The terms of the financial and other assistance being offered
                                    Paraguay are most carefully considered in the Department, and
                                    you may rest assured that no part of the program is carried out
                                    independently by any other agency of this Government without the
                                    Department’s full approval and, in most cases, urging. The
                                    financial terms of the Lend-Lease agreement with Paraguay were
                                    worked out, as you know, by the State Department, the War
                                    Department having no part in the matter. These financial terms
                                    were worked out giving careful <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660"
                                        facs="0674"/>consideration to the program of economic
                                    cooperation. Export-Import Bank loans must be considered what
                                    their name implies—loans. I should like also to call to your
                                    attention the fact that the Coordinator’s contribution of
                                    $1,000,000 is a grant and that a portion of the Export-Import
                                    Bank credit, it is contemplated, will take care of Paraguay’s
                                    share of a joint health program in which the United States puts
                                    up at least 50% of the total. It is obviously unfortunate to
                                    permit the impression to exist that the terms of one part of the
                                    arrangement are more onerous than others. They are all part of a
                                    joint program and must be considered as such.</item>

                                <item>It is my personal conviction that detailed contracts can not
                                    be signed at once unless the Paraguayan Government is able to
                                    give some instructions to its Ambassador. The best that we have
                                    been able to do is to get the Ambassador to transmit memoranda
                                    prepared wholly by the United States to Asunción. The
                                    Export-Import Bank has for many months been quite prepared to
                                    extend certain credits to Paraguay. You yourself, prior to
                                    departing for Asunción, sat in at a meeting of the trustees of
                                    the Bank at which some credits were voted. Paraguay has never
                                    seen fit to utilize any of these credits. It is absolutely
                                    essential that you work out with the health, sanitation and
                                    agricultural experts and with Mr. West, the representative of
                                    the Export-Import Bank, some of whom will be in Paraguay next
                                    week, details which can be incorporated into a contract. In the
                                    meantime, the Coordinator’s Office and the Export-Import Bank
                                    will prepare broad and general agreements to hand to the
                                    Paraguayan Ambassador during the next few days. All
                                    implementation must necessarily come from Asunción, and I rely
                                    confidently upon your efforts to obtain rapid action in
                                    Paraguay.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Department will inform you just as soon as draft contracts have been
                            put in the hands of the Paraguayan Ambassador, and it hopes that you
                            will be able during the next 2 weeks to report considerable progress in
                            arranging the details of the productive enterprises to be begun.

                            Ambassador by Mr. Pierson of the Export-Import Bank on June 3, 1942.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the contract establishes in favor of the Republic <pb

                            $3,000,000 to be utilized for projects approved by the Export-Import
                            Bank. The type of project which can be financed under the credit is
                            treated in very general terms in the contract in Article One. Any
                            withdrawals under the credit are to bear interest at the rate of four
                            percent per annum, the principal to be repayable in twenty semi-annual
                            installments. No principal payments are to be made for two and one-half
                            years after the date of the issuance of a note by the Republic of
                            Paraguay evidencing a withdrawal under the credit. Principal payments
                            then become due over the next ten years, increasing gradually from a
                            rate of one percent of the face value of the note semi-annually during
                            the first two years to nine percent in the last two years.</p>

                                n="30" xml:id="d615fn30">Not printed.</note> which was handed to the
                            Paraguayan Ambassador at the same time as the draft contract, setting
                            forth the procedure which should be followed by the Paraguayan
                            Government in order to execute the contract with the Bank.</p>
                        <p>The Paraguayan Ambassador is studying the contract and will probably
                            transmit it to his Government for approval. The Department feels that

                        <p>274. Department’s airmail instruction of June 11 enclosing draft
                            agreement between Export-Import Bank and Paraguay was discussed with
                            Argaña who had previously received draft from Ambassador Velázquez.
                            Argaña stated proposal was discussed in Cabinet meeting and referred to
                            Finance Minister<note n="31" xml:id="d616fn31">Rogelio Espinoza.</note>
                            for study. Preliminary opinion is that the conditions are severe in
                            respect to participation of Export-Import Bank and other American
                            experts and technicians. Argaña stated Brazil has signed a contract
                            loaning Paraguay 100,000 contos to be used with absolute freedom.</p>
                        <p>I brought out by inquiry for information the fact that this sum will be
                            available only in six annual installments. I mentioned that the basic
                            legislation of the Export-Import Bank imposes requisites arising from
                            circumstance which caused creation of bank. The point made in the
                            Department’s telegram No. 146 of May 14, noon [<hi rend="italic"
                                >midnight</hi>] <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0676"/>that our
                            entire program here should be regarded as a whole and that most of its
                            features are generous in the extreme was also fully expounded again.</p>
                        <p>I have talked subsequently with Finance Minister and he wishes to
                            ascertain whether conditions offered are similar to those accepted by
                            other countries especially as to supervision of projects. He also wishes
                            to study statute creating Export-Import Bank. Probabilities seem to be
                            that proposal will be accepted perhaps with requests for modification,
                            but terms of the Brazilian loan have certainly not contributed to
                            enhance Paraguay’s appreciation of our offer. Rumors still persist that
                            Brazilian loan is to be made with funds secured by Brazil through
                            borrowings in the United States.</p>

                        <p>205. Your 274, June 19, 9 p.m. The Department is sure that you agree that
                            no useful results will come of cooperation with Paraguay unless there is
                            a certain amount of technical assistance to insure the effective
                            carrying out of the projects.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the contract proposed by the Export-Import Bank is
                            similar and in some respects more liberal than those in effect with
                            other countries in which the funds are to be utilized not only for the
                            acquisition in the United States of machinery and equipment, but also
                            for local expenditures. It is only with a limited number of countries
                            that the Export-Import Bank has made contracts permitting any local
                            expenditures whatsoever. The provisions included in the draft agreement
                            prepared by the Export-Import Bank are liberal compared with similar
                            provisions in contracts with other countries in which local expenditures
                            are permitted.</p>
                        <p>All of the contracts which are limited to dollar expenditures in the
                            United States which have been entered into with the larger countries,
                            such as Brazil, are strictly limited in that no material may be
                            purchased for export from the United States without the specific
                            approval of the Export-Import Bank. These contracts are, if anything,
                            more restrictive than the contract with Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>It is not deemed that a detailed discussion of the Export-Import Bank
                            statute will be productive.</p>

                            development of strategic and critical materials. The group is to be
                            financed entirely by this Government since the members will be engaged
                            primarily in work for this Government. It is understood, however, that
                            the group may render appropriate assistance to Peruvian mining
                            authorities if such assistance can be arranged without interference to
                            their primary objective.</p>
                        <p>The men will be responsible to the Ambassador and subject to the
                            immediate direction of Charles Will Wright, who is now connected with
                            the Coordinator’s Office. The Department is informed that Wright has
                            already mailed to Lima detailed instructions for the <pb n="665"
                                xml:id="pg_665" facs="0679"/>group. All reports of the group will be
                            delivered through the Embassy to the Department.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to give these men appropriate cooperation and
                            assistance and to inform the Peruvian Government of the nature of their
                            visit. If the members of the group should wish to visit areas for which
                            permission is necessary, it is thought that this can be arranged
                            informally when the occasion arises.</p>
                        <p>The group is expected to arrive in Lima by plane on February 8. It will
                            consist of four members, all of whom are mining engineers. Ethelbert
                            Dowden is the head of the party, and the others are Kenneth Walker,
                            Frank Sistermans, and Carrel B. Larson. It was suggested in your
                            telegram no. 493 of September 3 [<hi rend="italic">23</hi>] 1941,<note

                            as a metallurgist. This was not possible to arrange because the Bureau
                            of Mines could not dispense with Woolf’s services.</p>
                        <p>Instructions for paying the expenses of the group will be transmitted
                            later.</p>

                        <p>227. Rubber Reserve Company is prepared to enter into commitment with
                            Peruvian Government to purchase entire production of rubber in Peru
                            except for an appropriate amount (to be agreed upon) necessary for
                            domestic consumption, at 30¼ cents United States currency per pound, f.
                            o. b. ocean carrying vessel at Belem, Brazil, for hard cut fine
                            classified rubber with appropriate differentials for other grades.
                            Purchases would be paid for on basis of cash against shipping documents
                            endorsed “on board” ocean carrying vessel at Belem and such other places
                            as may be deemed advisable by Rubber Reserve and Peru and subject to
                            final price adjustment based on quality inspection and net certified
                            weights determined at port of entry in United States. The term of the
                            agreement shall be to December 31, 1946, unless sooner terminated by
                            mutual consent, price paid being subject to change after expiration of
                            first 2 years if conditions change. The Government of Peru would agree
                            to restrict export licenses to Rubber Reserve Company or its nominees
                            and to restrict expansion of rubber manufacturing facilities and to
                            curtail rubber manufacturing as much as possible. The exportation of
                            manufactured rubber, if any, would be restricted to the United States.
                            Peru would agree to use its best efforts to cause maximum amount of
                            rubber to be produced and made available for sale to Reserve. Local
                            labor would be financed locally for necessities for collecting rubber.
                            Some governmental agency, if desirable, would <pb n="666"
                                xml:id="pg_666" facs="0680"/>be designated as the single buying
                            agency, otherwise sales would be made through usual trade channels now
                            in existence. Price on sales to Rubber Reserve would also be fixed as
                            local sales price.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing proposal corresponds generally to agreements entered into with

                        <p>284. Reference Department’s 227, March 18, 1 p.m. The Minister of
                                Finance<note n="3" xml:id="d620fn3">David Dasso.</note> was
                            favorably impressed with the proposal of the Rubber Reserve Company.
                            Since he will arrive in Washington during the first days of April he
                            stated that the matter will be discussed in detail with the
                            corresponding authorities there.</p>
                        <p>His principal observations were to the effect that an over-all agreement
                            with the United States would be preferable to a contract with any of the
                            other American Republics; and that he will want to discuss the subject
                            of establishing a tire factory in Peru which has been contemplated for
                            around 2 years.</p>
                        <p>Having read the Brazilian agreement in detail Mr. Dasso this morning
                            compared the price difference between the Peruvian offer and the
                            Brazilian contract and expressed the wishes that the American Government
                            study the possibility of offering Peru a contract identical with
                            Brazil’s. He remarked further that present plans contemplate
                            considerable shipments from the west coast of Peru and that he would
                            like to have also this point receive consideration prior to his arrival
                            in Washington.</p>

                            by Rubber Reserve Company for Peruvian rubber is exactly same as price
                            being paid Brazil for same grade. Point can be quickly cleared up when

                            Republics at Rio de Janeiro, for developing the production of rubber in
                            Peru and for making available to the United States all rubber produced

                            United States of materials and equipment required in connection with the
                            construction and development in Peru of useful public works and of

                            station in the Amazon region of Peru. These discussions have culminated
                            in an agreement with the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States,

                            between our two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Government wishes to inform Your Excellency’s Government
                            that it has entered into discussions with the Foreign Bondholders

                            payments on the Peruvian dollar debt. These discussions with regard to
                            the scale and amount of payments will be continued after my return to

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have received with deep
                            gratification Your Excellency’s cordial note of April 23, 1942 with
                            reference to the matters which I and other officials of the Government
                            of the United States have had the privilege of discussing with you
                            during your visit to Washington. I need not assure you of the personal
                            satisfaction which it has been for me to collaborate with you in the
                            establishment of a program to attain certain of the objectives of the
                            Resolutions of the Third Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the
                            American Republics at Rio de Janeiro, and I am convinced that the
                            decisions taken will contribute in important degree to the security of
                            the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>My Government is pleased to note that, in furtherance of Resolution II on
                            the Production of Strategic Materials, Your Excellency’s Government is
                            creating a Peruvian Amazon Corporation to undertake and stimulate the
                            production of strategic tropical products. In this connection I have
                            today transmitted to Your Excellency a note accepting the proposal of
                            the Government of Peru with respect to the acquisition by the Rubber
                            Reserve Company over a period of five years of all rubber produced in
                            Peru other than the specified amount required for essential uses in
                            Peru. This agreement marks an important step in the carrying out of the
                            broad program for the mobilization <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672"
                                facs="0686"/>of strategic material resources for the security of the
                            hemisphere which was undertaken at the recent Rio de Janeiro
                            Meeting.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by the Secretary of Commerce that the Export-Import Bank
                            finds itself heartily in sympathy with the objectives of the program of
                            the Government of Peru and is prepared to establish a credit in favor of
                            Banco Central de Reserva del Peru in the sum of $25,000,000 to assist in
                            financing purchases in the United States of materials and equipment
                            required in connection with the construction and development in Peru of
                            useful public works, and of agricultural, mining and industrial
                            projects. It is recognized that the United States cannot undertake to
                            furnish machinery and equipment in short supply due to the exigencies of
                            war, and that priorities necessary to acquire such items in the United
                            States will be granted only after careful study and determination that
                            the establishment of the industry for which they are needed will
                            contribute directly in important measure to the war effort of the United
                            States and the security of the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>I have noted with satisfaction and interest the agreements entered into
                            by Your Excellency with the Secretary of Agriculture for the
                            establishment of an agricultural experiment station at Tingo María and
                            for the purchase through the Commodity Credit Corporation of that
                            portion of the Peruvian cotton production which is in excess of sales
                            for Peruvian consumption and for export to other purchasers. I also take
                            pleasure in informing you that my Government has found it possible to
                            arrange to make available to Your Excellency’s Government the services
                            of competent experts in highway engineering, erosion control, coal
                            mining, and tea processing.</p>
                        <p>My Government has noted with great satisfaction the measures adopted by
                            the Peruvian Government to control the commercial and financial
                            operations of persons whose activities are deemed inimical to the
                            security of the hemisphere, which are referred to in Your Excellency’s
                            note, as well as Your Excellency’s statement that the Government of Peru
                            will consult with the Government of the United States regarding any
                            measures which may be necessary to prevent such persons from benefiting
                            from the agreements reached between our two Governments. It is
                            understood that the two Governments will consult particularly with
                            respect to the policies and procedures to be adopted for dealing with
                            cotton which may be produced by persons or firms on the United States

                        <p>I likewise welcome the information that the Government of Peru is
                            carrying on discussions with the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council,
                            Incorporated, looking towards an early resumption of payments on the

                        signed at Washington March 11, 1942 (not printed), provided that Peru was to
                        repay 41.38 percent of the scheduled cost (about $29,000,000) of armaments
                        and munitions transferred by the United States to Peru, in installments for
                        a total of not more than $2,000,000 before March 1, 1943; $4,000,000 before
                        March 1, 1944; $6,000,000 before March 1, 1945; $8,000,000 before March 1,

                        <p>Señor Chavez called at his request to discuss several questions in
                            connection with the proposed trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>With respect to cotton, Señor Chavez mentioned the difficulties now
                            facing Peru particularly as a result of the closing of the Japanese
                            market which had provided the largest outlet for Peruvian cotton during
                            the past year. It was essential, therefore, Señor Chavez said, that the
                            proposed trade agreement include as liberal a concession as possible on
                            this commodity. Mr. Hawkins indicated to Señor Chavez that the question
                            of a concession on cotton was receiving thorough and active
                            consideration and although the Department of State was entirely
                            sympathetic toward the request of the Peruvian Government, it was
                            anticipated that considerable difficulties would be encountered from
                            certain of the agencies in the Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>Replies were given to Señor Chavez on a number of questions which he
                            raised concerning the information to be presented in the form of written
                            briefs and at the public hearings.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez was informed that we hoped to be able to give him a revised
                            draft of general provisions no later than January 14 and hoped to be
                            able to place in his hands a preliminary and tentative Schedule I list
                            by the end of the present week.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez stated that the desire had been expressed by certain of the
                            Peruvian officials that the trade agreement negotiations be conducted in
                            Lima. Mr. Hawkins stated that this was a question on which a definite
                            answer could not be given immediately.</p>

                            draft of general provisions for the proposed trade agreement with Peru.
                            The changes incorporated in the new text, which were largely matters of
                            style, were gone over with Señor Chavez in detail and the new draft
                            compared with the earlier draft text handed the Peruvian Embassy on June

                            Government …</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez raised two points during the discussion of the new text: <list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item>In Article XI, paragraph 2, he suggested that the composition
                                    of the mixed commission might be covered in more specific
                                    language, that is, the number of members to represent each
                                    Government, etc., although Señor Chavez was willing to accept
                                    the draft in the form presented, which merely provided for the
                                    establishment of a mixed commission.</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>In Article XV, paragraph 3, Señor Chavez advanced the
                                    suggestion, in order to centralize consideration of all
                                    questions arising between the two Governments in connection with
                                    the operation of the agreement, that the mixed commission
                                    provided for under Article XI might consider various technical
                                    questions arising in connection with sanitary matters, etc.,
                                    instead of appointing a committee of technical experts to
                                    consider each such question as it arose. Señor Chavez felt that
                                    the mixed commission would in any case have to call in technical
                                    experts on practically all questions which might arise under the
                                    operation of the agreement and matters of a sanitary, etc.,
                                    character might be handled by the mixed commission in the same
                                    manner as more general questions.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>

                                the Sugar Division, Department of Agriculture.</note> telephoned
                            regarding the call which I had made at his office on January 15,
                            concerning a possible concession on sugar in the proposed trade
                            agreement with Peru.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the attitude of the Department of Agriculture
                            concerning the possibility, if a request were received from the Peruvian
                            Government, of giving some form of commitment regarding the maintenance
                            of Peru’s position as a supplier of sugar for the United States market
                            as compared with its position under the Sugar Act of 1937,<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d630fn19">50 Stat. 903.</note> Dr. Bernhardt stated that as
                            a matter of policy he felt that his Department would be opposed to
                            offering any commitment which might appear to be an infringement by the
                            Executive on the powers of the Congress. As a practical matter, however,
                            Dr. Bernhardt felt that any request which might come from the Peruvian
                            Government for a commitment of the nature indicated could fairly easily
                            be discouraged if it were pointed out that for the duration of the war
                            we would be desirous of securing as much sugar as possible from Peru and
                            therefore the quota system would not stand in the way of enabling Peru
                            to market sugar in this country. Dr. Bernhardt thought also that the
                            additional argument might be used with the Peruvians that it would be
                            very difficult for us at this time to make any commitments concerning a
                            situation which depended so much upon developments in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>I assured Dr. Bernhardt that we would of course do nothing to encourage a
                            Peruvian request for a commitment, but merely wished to learn the views
                            of Agriculture in case such a request were received.</p>

                            the United States and Peru, there is attached a tentative list of the
                            tariff concessions<note n="21" xml:id="d631fn21">Not printed.</note>
                            desired by the Government of the United States upon products exported
                            from the United States to Peru. This list must be considered as
                            preliminary, subject to modification by the <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677"
                                facs="0691"/>addition of further items or changes in the attached
                            list, in the light of information received by the Government of the
                            United States from interested persons through the submission of written
                            briefs or by statements at the public hearings. The attached list is
                            submitted at this time, rather than waiting until a definitive list can
                            be submitted, in order that the preliminary discussions may be advanced
                            as far as possible in the near future. It would be appreciated if the
                            Government of Peru could indicate at an early date its views with regard
                            to the list now presented.</p>
                        <p>The present list of items covers products of which imports into Peru in
                            1940 were valued at approximately 33,750,000 soles, or about 20 percent
                            of total Peruvian imports from the United States of 169,261,000 soles in
                            that year. Requests for improved tariff treatment cover products in the
                            attached list which accounted for imports from the United States in 1940
                            of about 15,800,000 soles, or 9 percent of total Peruvian imports from
                            the United States, while in the case of these items on which the
                            concession requested is for a consolidation of existing tariff
                            treatment, the affected products represented approximately 17,950,000
                            soles or about 11 percent of total imports into Peru from the United
                            States.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez called by request to receive a tentative list of
                                concessions<note n="22" xml:id="d632fn22">Not printed, but see <hi
                                    rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> which the United States desired
                            in the proposed trade agreement with Peru, and some time was spent in
                            going over the individual items in the list.</p>
                        <p>The chief comment by Señor Chavez was that his Government would consider
                            that all the items in the list represented requests for reductions in
                            duty, in as much as the rates used by the United States as a basis for
                            both reductions and bindings had recently been increased by 20 percent
                            and, therefore, the proposed bindings actually represented reductions in
                            duty rather than a consolidation of existing rates. I pointed out to
                            Señor Chavez that while as he had stated, the principal reason for the
                            increased rates of duty was to compensate for the depreciation in the
                            value of the sol nevertheless it would probably appear to exporters in
                            this country that Peruvian rates of duty had been increased more or less
                            during the period of the negotiations and that bindings of the new,
                            higher rates of duty would not in effect be bindings. <pb n="678"
                                xml:id="pg_678" facs="0692"/>I also mentioned to Señor Chavez that
                            Peru would, of course, have the benefit of the increased rates of duty
                            on all imports from the United States other than those which finally
                            appeared in Schedule I, as well as upon imports from other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez said that he would transmit the list today by air mail to
                            his Government, in order that studies might be begun in Lima as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez called at his request to leave a translation of a
                                memorandum<note n="23" xml:id="d633fn23">Not printed.</note> which
                            he had received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lima, regarding
                            the requests by the United States for concessions in the proposed trade
                            agreement on products imported into Peru from the United States. This
                            memorandum pointed out that the increase of 20 percent in basic Peruvian
                            customs duties of December 22, 1941, was already in effect when the
                            Department of State issued its public announcement on December 29<note
                                n="24" xml:id="d633fn24">Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, January 3, 1942, p. 22.</note> of intention to
                            negotiate with Peru. For this reason, as well as the fact that the
                            increase in duties was merely for the purpose of compensating for
                            depreciation in the sol, it was hoped that the United States would not
                            insist on using the tariff rates in effect prior to December 22, 1941 as
                            a basis for the concessions requested of the Peruvian Government.</p>
                        <p>I did not attempt to go into the question in any detail with Señor
                            Chavez. I told him that we hoped that by the end of the current week to
                            place in his hands our final request list, which would involve the
                            addition of a few items to the list already given to the Peruvian
                            Government, and I thought that we would probably make our requests on
                            the same basis as the preliminary list. We could then, when we had
                            arrived at the actual stage of the negotiations, consider the memorandum
                            from the Peruvian Government in relation to our entire request list. I
                            added that it might be confusing if we presented additional items on a
                            different basis than the preliminary requests which had been made
                            earlier.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez said that he had received yesterday a telegram from his
                            Government requesting him to come to Lima by plane in the immediate
                            future in order to be available for consultation regarding certain
                            problems raised by the concessions requested by the United States,
                            particularly those involving preferences by Peru to Chile. <pb n="679"
                                xml:id="pg_679" facs="0693"/>Señor Chavez indicated that he would
                            probably delay his departure for a few days until he had received our
                            final request list.</p>

                            several days, to inquire if he had received any new information from his
                            Government concerning the trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had had a telephone conversation on February 18 with the

                                (194043).</note> and that the conversation had been devoted chiefly
                            to the question of cotton. Señor Chavez said that it had been agreed
                            that for the present the Peruvian Government would withhold any further
                            expression of its interest in any plan for the purchase of Peruvian
                            cotton by the Government of the United States. I mentioned to Señor
                            Chavez in this connection that it appeared to be the understanding in
                            the Department of Agriculture that the Peruvian Government had much more
                            interest in a cotton purchase plan than in the trade agreement. Señor
                            Chavez said that he had been trying to see Mr. Wheeler<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d634fn27">Leslie A. Wheeler, Director of Foreign

                            to him the information received from Lima as to the attitude of the
                            Peruvian Government on the purchase proposal but had been informed that
                            Mr. Wheeler was out of town and would not return until February 23.
                            Señor Chavez expressed an interest in discussing the cotton question
                            with Mr. Hawkins prior to seeing Mr. Wheeler and I said that I would try
                            to arrange an appointment for February 23 or 24.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez referred to an article appearing in <hi rend="italic">La
                                Prensa</hi> of New York on February 20 stating that the matter of
                            quotas on Peruvian cotton was under discussion in the Department of
                            Agriculture and there was a wide divergence of views in that Department
                            on the matter. I told Señor Chavez that I had not seen the article but
                            that I had learned that some information had leaked out on the cotton
                            matter to the press and also that a concerted campaign appeared to be
                            getting under way to prevent any action to liberalize the present cotton
                            quotas. Without indicating any details I mentioned to Señor Chavez that
                            the outlook at present for action on the quotas favorable to Peru did

                        <p>I asked Señor Chavez if he had any information whether Señor Beltran was
                            planning to return to Washington in the near future and he said that as
                            far as he knew Señor Beltran had no plans along that line. Señor Chavez
                            also said that he planned to leave for Lima on February 28 by plane.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez said that he had received no indication from his Government
                            as yet regarding its attitude on our proposals on the general provisions
                            of the proposed agreement but said that he had written to Lima about a
                            week ago urging that consideration be given to this matter in order that
                            this part of the negotiations might be advanced as rapidly as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Great efforts have lately
                            been made by the Governments of Peru and the United States to promote
                            trade between the two countries, to facilitate the importation of United
                            States goods to Peru, to create markets in the United States for
                            Peruvian products, and to foster the development of Peruvian products
                            needed in the United States. Financial and technical aid has been
                            granted by the United States to Peruvian agriculture and industry; in
                            short, the United States Government has realized the importance United
                            States markets have acquired for South American products, now that war
                            conditions have closed European markets, and in a spirit of continental
                            cooperation apparently wishes to render these markets available to South
                            American products not competing with domestic products. In conformity
                            with this policy, general trade agreements have been signed during the
                            past few years between the United States and Latin American countries;
                            and at the present time a trade agreement is being negotiated between
                            Peru and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Long staple cotton, one of Peru’s main products, has for many years been
                            barred from the United States by a 7¢ per pound duty; a reduction of
                            this duty is being considered in the present negotiations. But a quota
                            system established by the United States in September, 1939, as the
                            result of a subsidy to the export of United States cotton—and maintained
                            even after the said subsidy was suspended—constitutes another barrier to
                            the importation of Peruvian cotton to the United States. Any reduction
                            that Peru, through a trade agreement, could obtain on the import duties
                            of cotton, would be useless if quota restrictions were not removed.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0695"/>
                        <p>Your Excellency, no doubt, is well aware of the situation; and I am fully
                            cognizant of the efforts made to improve it. Nevertheless, I beg leave
                            to insist on one point.</p>
                        <p>Long staple cotton is not produced on a large scale in the United States;
                            it has always been imported from abroad. Orders issued for the
                            conservation of wool and woolen fabrics, in view of possible future
                            shortages of the basic raw material, make long staple cotton a much
                            needed product at present; so that its importation from Peru would seem
                            an obvious recourse. Consequently, one would have been led to believe
                            that quota restrictions would be removed in order that long staple
                            Peruvian cotton could be introduced in this country, as the best suited
                            for admixture with wool in the manufactory of hosiery and other fabrics.
                            Unfortunately, such has not been the case. I am informed that the
                            Department of Agriculture is offering United States farmers who are
                            willing to produce long staple cotton a higher subsidy than the one
                            presently established for short staple cotton. When long staple cotton
                            needed by this country is obtainable in Peru and could easily be
                            imported, it has been thought preferable to induce United States farmers
                            to grow that product, excluding thereby the similar Peruvian one.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely trust that Your Excellency will feel justified in bringing,
                            once more if necessary, the whole situation, as briefly sketched herein,
                            to the attention of the appropriate authorities, so that, if new
                            subsidies are offered to the United States cotton growers in addition to
                            the import duties which already protect them, and to the previous
                            subsidies they enjoy in virtue of the Agricultural Adjustment Act,<note

                            repeatedly regarding Schedule II proposals to be transmitted to Peruvian
                            Government through you. However, our position regarding cotton has not
                            yet been worked out and it may be several days before it can be. Since
                            the list cannot reach you before departure of Dasso and Beltran, it will
                            be presented here following their arrival.</p>

                            our desire to proceed with trade-agreement negotiations with Peru and
                            set forth the principal bases on which it was tentatively proposed to
                            conduct such negotiations. Your approval having been given, public
                            notice of intention to negotiate was issued on December 29, and public
                            hearings were held on February 2 and 3. The views of interested persons
                            having been received and studied, the trade-agreements organization has
                            now submitted unanimous recommendations on all products, with the
                            exception of long-staple cotton, which were to come under consideration
                            for the possible granting of concessions to Peru. I concur in these
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The most important products, other than cotton, on which it is
                            recommended that duty reductions be offered are sugar; alpaca, llama and
                            vicuña hair; and certain tropical cabinet woods. It is proposed to offer
                            the maximum permitted reductions to Peru on these products and it is
                            believed that this can be done without any material injury to domestic
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>It is also proposed to offer reductions in duty on a number of other less
                            important items of interest to Peru, most of which are not produced in
                            this country in significant amounts; to offer to bind certain rates of
                            duty reduced in previous trade agreements; and to bind a number of
                            noncompetitive items on the free list. For your information I enclose a
                            list of the concessions<note n="30" xml:id="d637fn30">Not
                                printed.</note> which it is now proposed to offer to Peru.</p>
                        <p>With respect to cotton, unanimous agreement has not yet been reached by
                            the interdepartmental organization regarding the granting of a
                            concession on this product, of major interest to Peru, and a
                            recommendation is therefore not being made at this time. Pending
                            settlement of this question it is proposed to advance the negotiations
                            as far as possible with the Peruvian officials on the basis of the
                            proposals outlined above, and I should appreciate being informed whether
                            these meet with your approval.<note n="31" xml:id="d637fn31">President

                        <p>Señor Chavez called at the Department to receive the list of the products
                            on which this Government was prepared to offer concessions in the
                            proposed trade agreement with Peru. The absence of long-staple cotton
                            from the list was, of course, noted by Señor Chavez and he was informed
                            that a final decision had not yet been reached whether it would be
                            possible to include a concession on this product in the agreement. There
                            was a brief discussion of the relation of a possible concession on
                            cotton in the trade agreement to the negotiations now being carried on
                            for the purchase by an agency of this Government of the Peruvian cotton
                            surplus, and it was agreed that further discussions regarding cotton in
                            the trade agreement would await outcome of the negotiations for the
                            purchase. In the meantime it was decided that we could proceed as far as
                            possible with the negotiations on other questions in the agreement,
                            including Schedule I and the General Provisions. Regarding Schedule I
                            Señor Chavez said that he was awaiting receipt of information from his
                            Government. He said that in the discussions which he had had while he
                            was in Lima, there were a few specific commodities in which difficulties
                            would probably be encountered, particularly those where Peruvian
                            concessions to Chile were involved or where certain domestic industries
                            were affected, but on the whole he did not think that too great
                            difficulty would be encountered in reaching a satisfactory agreement.
                            Señor Chavez mentioned also, of course, the general question of the 20
                            percent increase in basic Peruvian import duties, which would have to be
                            settled to arrive at the basis upon which duty reductions or bindings on
                            specific commodities would be calculated. On the General Provisions,
                            Señor Chavez said that he had only just received a Spanish translation
                            of our proposals, but as there was no indication whether this meant that
                            our proposals as presented were acceptable to the Peruvian Government,
                            he had immediately written to Lima for clarification on this point.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez telephoned and said that he had just had a chance to examine
                            in detail the list of our definitive Schedule II offers <pb n="684"
                                xml:id="pg_684" facs="0698"/>which had been handed to him on April
                            2. He had several questions about the list.</p>
                        <p>Concerning alpaca and other hair, he wondered why the 50 percent
                            reduction had not been offered on all the items under paragraph 1102(<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>). I explained the reason for this indicating
                            the desirability of maintaining the absolute spread between the duties
                            on these products in the various forms in which they were imported. In
                            response to another question, I indicated that the offers shown under
                            paragraph 1001 on flax, were bindings of duties already reduced to the
                            maximum extent possible, and not bindings of Tariff Act rates.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the absence of panama hats, I indicated to Señor Chavez that
                            certain questions had arisen concerning the trade agreement with Ecuador
                            which made it seem desirable, temporarily at least, to withhold offering
                            to Peru a binding of the rate reduced in the trade agreement with
                            Ecuador. I said, however, that if the Peruvian Government were very much
                            interested in this item we would, of course, be glad to reconsider the
                            possibility of including in Schedule II, a binding of the rate reduced
                            to Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the absence of tungsten, I mentioned to Señor Chavez that this
                            product had been included in the list accompanying the public
                            announcement of intention to negotiate with Bolivia, which had been
                            issued on April 4, and whether or not it might be possible to include a
                            concession on tungsten in the trade agreement with Peru would depend in
                            large measure on what was done in the case of the proposed agreement
                            with Bolivia. Señor Chavez recognized that Peru was a minor supplier of
                            tungsten as compared with Bolivia.</p>

                        <p>The Finance Minister accompanied by the other gentlemen above mentioned
                            called to discuss certain matters connected with the proposed trade
                            agreement with Peru. The Minister was principally concerned with the
                            question of a concession in the trade agreement on long-staple cotton.
                            The concession he had in mind was a reduction <pb n="685"
                                xml:id="pg_685" facs="0699"/>in duty and a lifting of the quota. He
                            felt that failure to include a suitable concession on as important a
                            product as long-staple cotton would be very hard to defend in Peru. He
                            said he could not understand how we could deny such a concession
                            consistently with the principles of commercial policy which we have
                            advocated and proclaimed for a number of years. He said that that policy
                            would require that instead of putting quotas and high duties on the
                            product, Peru should be given the chance and encouraged to supply our
                            needs. Instead of this, he finds that in addition to the most
                            restrictive kinds of import barriers erected against the Peruvian
                            product, we are now subsidizing our growers heavily in order to induce
                            them to grow more of it and thereby to displace what might be obtained
                            from Peru to the advantage of both countries.</p>
                        <p>Referring further to the political implications of leaving a cotton
                            concession out of the trade agreement, the Minister went on to say that
                            the Peruvian public cannot be expected to analyze the situation so
                            closely as to appreciate whatever considerations there may be against
                            the granting of such a concession; that the public is likely to view the
                            situation superficially and to remember that, irrespective of
                            circumstances and motives, the fact is that a while ago their cotton
                            problem was largely solved by heavy purchases from Japan.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the remainder of the agreement, the Minister felt that no
                            serious difficulties are likely to be presented. He felt that in general
                            Peru could satisfy our requests for concessions by that country and that
                            other concessions offered by the United States were satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he expected to bring up the matter of the trade
                            agreement next week with a view to pushing the negotiations to a
                            conclusion before he leaves this country. He hoped that this could be
                            done within a week or ten days and felt that this would be possible if
                            the question of the cotton concession could be disposed of
                            satisfactorily.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez called to discuss the general provisions of the proposed
                            agreement, bringing with him a Spanish draft which had been approved by
                            Señor David Dasso, Peruvian Finance Minister now in Washington. It
                            became apparent, after examining a few of the articles, that the
                            Peruvian officials in Lima had made a translation into Spanish of the
                            Department’s draft general provisions of June 1941 <pb n="686"
                                xml:id="pg_686" facs="0700"/>rather than the revised draft of
                            January 1942. Señor Chavez therefore made changes from time to time to
                            bring the style of the draft in Spanish into line with the revised
                            English draft.</p>
                        <p>There were no questions of substance raised by the Peruvians on the
                            Preamble nor on Articles I, II, III, IV and V. Señor Chavez mentioned,
                            incidentally, that the Finance Minister had vetoed a proposal from Lima
                            that the provision for national treatment on internal taxes in Article
                            II be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>In Article VI Señor Chavez said that it was the desire of the Finance
                            Minister, under the second paragraph, that the provision be dropped for
                            thirty days advance notice on changes by administrative ruling. I
                            explained to Señor Chavez that we regarded this as a matter of some
                            importance, it was of value to both countries, its inclusion prevented
                            the working of hardships on traders as a result of sudden tariff changes
                            and we therefore hoped that the Finance Minister would consider the
                            possibility of including the thirty-day provision, which had appeared in
                            trade agreements with most other countries. Señor Chavez said that he
                            would bring this to the attention of the Finance Minister.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Article VII, Señor Chavez stated that the Finance
                            Minister wished the draft amended so that the Peruvian Government, if it
                            were faced with a difficult situation as a result of loss of customs
                            revenues from currency depreciation or other causes, would be enabled to
                            increase the rates of duty or surcharges on imported articles included
                            in Schedule I. Señor Chavez referred particularly to the recent
                            situation as a result of which the Peruvian Government had found it
                            necessary to impose a flat 20 percent surcharge on basic customs duties
                            in order to compensate for depreciation of the sol. I told Señor Chavez
                            that in formulating our requests for concessions we had endeavored to be
                            modest in our requests; in fact, including both requests for reductions
                            in duty and bindings of existing rates, our requests covered only 20
                            percent of total Peruvian imports from the United States in 1940.
                            Therefore, if the Peruvian Government at some future time found it
                            necessary to take the action contemplated, there would be 80 percent or
                            more of imports from United States which would not be affected by the
                            provisions of Article VII binding basic rates of duty and supplementary
                            charges on Schedule I products. I also told Señor Chavez that it would
                            probably be difficult to explain to exporters in this country why, when
                            we had received concessions on 20 percent or less of our shipments to
                            Peru, even that 20 percent could not be guaranteed against less
                            favorable customs treatment in the future. Señor Chavez seemed to
                            appreciate these points and said that he would pass them on to the
                            Finance Minister. However, as he still had some doubts as to whether the
                            Finance Minister would accept these arguments, I pointed out to Señor
                            Chavez <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0701"/>that, leaving Articles
                            VII and VIII as proposed by this Government, if the Peruvian Government
                            at some time in the future should find itself in an extremely difficult
                            financial position and should need the additional revenues from an
                            increase in customs duties on scheduled products, I was sure that this
                            Government would give sympathetic consideration to any proposals which
                            the Peruvian Government might make looking toward the relief of their
                            financial situation. I told Señor Chavez that this was precisely one of
                            the things that could be considered by the Mixed Commission which was
                            provided for under the second paragraph of Article XI.</p>
                        <p>I told Señor Chavez that during the next few days we might possibly want
                            to advance a proposal regarding the binding of export duties and taxes
                            on scheduled articles. I told him that I did not have a definitive
                            proposal on this but I merely wanted to let him know that we might wish
                            to bring it up a little later.</p>
                        <p>At this point Señor Chavez had to leave to keep another appointment and
                            it was agreed that the discussion would be continued the next day.</p>

                        <p>I have just been informed by Dr. Francisco Tudela that the American list
                            is acceptable to the Peruvian government and that the Peruvian Embassy
                            in Washington today is being advised to that effect.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the cotton quota, Dr. Tudela stated that the Peruvians
                            realize the political difficulties encountered in the United States and
                            that if it is impossible eventually to remove the quota an alternative
                            measure is being suggested that some provision be included which would
                            permit the redistribution of quotas, along the lines adopted in past
                            years with reference to the redistribution of the sugar quota.</p>
                        <p>The only additional comment I have to make at the present time is with
                            reference to the 20% increase in the basic Peruvian import duties. If
                            adequate adjustments are not made, it is quite possible that nations
                            which enjoy most favored nation treatment with Peru <pb n="688"
                                xml:id="pg_688" facs="0702"/>on the basis of the old duties will
                            have a competitive advantage over the United States.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez called to continue the discussion of April 22 regarding the
                            general provisions. He indicated that the Peruvian Government had no
                            changes to suggest in any of the provisions from Article IX to Article
                            XV, inclusive, which covered everything with the exception of the final
                            article relating to entry into force, duration and termination. We then
                            prepared a draft of this article in accordance with the procedure
                            followed in this country and that which Señor Chavez said would be in
                            line with the procedural requirements in Peru for bringing the agreement
                            into force. This draft appears in substantially the same form in the
                            final draft of the agreement. It was agreed that the initial period of
                            the agreement should be three years rather than two. This was the desire
                            of the Peruvian Government, and I told Señor Chavez that there probably
                            would be no objection to it here.</p>
                        <p>Señor Chavez indicated at the meeting today that the Peruvian Government
                            had accepted all our proposals on Schedule II with the exception of
                            course that they could not sign the agreement unless the reduction of 50
                            percent in the duty on long-staple cotton were included. I told Señor
                            Chavez that his Government’s views on the question of the cotton would
                            of course be brought up again before the Trade Agreements Committee.</p>

                                    would compel the Peruvian Government to grant to Chile new

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: On March 28 Mr. Welles
                            wrote to you concerning the conclusion of the proposed trade agreement
                            with Peru, indicating that full accord had not yet been reached in the
                            trade-agreements organization on the question of the action to be taken
                            on long-staple cotton.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations on all other points have virtually been concluded.
                            However, the Peruvian officials, including the Finance Minister now
                            visiting here, have taken the position that a trade agreement between
                            Peru and the United States, with its long-range implications, which did
                            not include any concession at all on as vitally important a Peruvian
                            export commodity as long-staple cotton, would be very difficult to
                            defend in Peru. In short, the Peruvian officials are unwilling to sign
                            an agreement not including long-staple cotton.</p>
                        <p>In order to provide a concession of any great value to Peru, it would be
                            necessary not only to reduce the duty but also to increase or remove the
                            quota at present imposed pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural
                            Adjustment Act, which limits imports from Peru to about 4,000 bales
                            annually. We propose merely a reduction of 50 percent in duty in the
                            agreement, with the right reserved to impose quotas under the
                            Agricultural Adjustment Act, and separate and subsequent action to
                            consolidate the present individual country quotas into a global amount
                            equal to the individual quotas. This would allow Peru to compete with
                            other countries for the entire amount of whatever imports are permitted
                            under quota. This would be useful because of the present and impending
                            shortage of long-staple cotton in connection with the war effort, and
                            should hardly cause concern to domestic growers who are now being
                            encouraged, by means of guaranteed <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691"
                                facs="0705"/>premiums and otherwise, to produce as much long-staple
                            cotton as possible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Wickard,<note n="38" xml:id="d646fn38">Claude R. Wickard,
                                Secretary of Agriculture.</note> who has indicated opposition at
                            this time to any change whatever in either the import duty or the import
                            quota, will be absent from the city all of this week and we have been
                            informed that he cannot be reached. However, it is highly desirable that
                            the agreement with Peru be concluded before the return to Lima of the
                            Finance Minister, which may be in the next few days.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate being advised whether the foregoing proposal, which
                            will be accepted by the Peruvians and will enable us to conclude rapidly
                            a generally satisfactory and valuable agreement, meets with your
                                approval.<note n="39" xml:id="d646fn39">No record of a reply from
                                President Roosevelt has been found in the Department files. Approval
                                was apparently given, however, as the agreement was made on this
                                basis. See memorandum by Mr. H. Gerald Smith, May 6, <ref

                        <p>As you know, I have always sought to act in close consultation and
                            cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture in these matters and
                            should like to have consulted him further on the subject now under
                            consideration, with particular reference to the moderate proposal
                            outlined above. However, the presence in this country of the Peruvian
                            Minister of Finance furnishes a highly favorable opportunity to bring
                            these negotiations to a successful conclusion, and we are confronted
                            with the danger of losing this opportunity if we postpone action until
                            Mr. Wickard returns. However, this is a matter for you to pass on.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that the delegation of cotton technicians composed of Messrs. Norris,
                            Moffat and Cook arrived in Lima on April 29. They were met at the
                            airport by numerous representatives of the Cotton Chamber, the Agrarian
                            Society and the Finance Ministry. After exchanging visits with members
                            of the foregoing organizations as well as with a special committee
                            designated by the acting Finance Minister to assist them in their work,
                            they paid an official call upon the Finance Minister a.i. Moreyra on the
                            afternoon of April 30.</p>
                        <p>Some uncertainty has been expressed in cotton trade circles during the
                            last few days with reference to the time or period in which the <pb
                                n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0706"/>purchase of cotton will
                            actually take place. Those at interest have called attention to the fact
                            that the lack of income through sales of cotton futures is adversely
                            affecting certain growers to some extent. All of this talk, of course,
                            had as its principal purpose the encouragement of actual purchases at
                            the earliest possible moment. After consulting with various authorities
                            on the subject, I am inclined to attribute no special importance to
                            those views. The absence of sales of futures this year differs little
                            from the conditions which prevailed during the preceding two years.
                            Moreover, the Agrarian Bank is offering to the cotton growers such
                            financial assistance as they may need.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the arrival of the delegation and the information which
                            they have already conveyed to the principal personalities have been
                            sufficient to produce satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The understanding which has been reached by the United States and
                            Peruvian governments constitutes one of the most far-reaching economic
                            and political developments which has taken place in Peru in recent
                            years. As is well known, the cotton interests represent probably the
                            strongest political influences in the nation, and the fact that cotton
                            production and marketing problems have been settled for this and
                            succeeding years has already created an attitude of confidence and
                            cooperation whose consequences will be of immense value in maintaining
                            the stability of the incumbent administration, and in more rapidly and
                            effectively achieving a number of our anti-Axis objectives in Peru. The
                            Department will be interested in learning that President Prado, himself,
                            yesterday made very favorable comments upon the rapidity with which the
                            cotton problem had been solved. The arrival of the delegation within one
                            week of the signing of the understanding impressed upon him the
                            determination of the American government to discharge its part of the
                            cooperative program with precision.</p>
                        <p>The members of the delegation are fully aware of the importance of their
                            assignment and from the moment of their arrival directed their
                            activities in the direction of the Government’s general policy in Peru.
                            During their conversation with the Finance Minister a.i. on April 30,
                            they placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and made it
                            clear that the Japanese and other Axis elements interested in cotton
                            either directly or indirectly may not derive benefit. The Minister as
                            well as the representatives of the Cotton Chamber and the Agrarian
                            Society expressed complete approval of this part of the understanding
                            and assured the delegates that they had been familiar with this phase of
                            the question for some time and are disposed to cooperate.</p>

                        <p>The trade agreement with Peru which is about to be signed is accompanied
                            by two exchanges of notes: <list>

                                <item>An exchange of notes regarding exclusive preferences extended
                                    by Peru to contiguous countries. In this case the draft of notes
                                    follows closely the formula which was used in the trade
                                    agreement with Argentina in October 1941. The substance of this
                                    note had been agreed upon some months ago with the Peruvian
                                    negotiators as part of the basis for going ahead with the trade
                                    agreement negotiations and does not seem to require any further
                                    comment.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The second note expresses the understanding worked out by
                                    officers of the Department with the Peruvian negotiators
                                    regarding what could be done in the matter of the present import
                                    quota on Peruvian long-staple cotton. The Peruvian officials
                                    were informed that the proposal which was embodied in the notes
                                    is the maximum which can be offered at this time and they
                                    expressed a willingness to accept it, in as much as it had been
                                    found impossible, owing to opposition by the Department of
                                    Agriculture, to secure the complete removal of import quotas at
                                    present. The understanding developed therefore that the
                                    Department, following conclusion of the agreement, which would
                                    contain a reduction in the duty on long-staple cotton, would
                                    request the Tariff Commission to institute an investigation
                                    under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as
                                    amended, with a view to consolidating the present individual
                                    country quotas into a global quota equal to the sum of the
                                    existing individual quotas. In view of present and probable
                                    shipping difficulties, it was possible that under such an
                                    arrangement Peru would have an opportunity of supplying that
                                    portion of the individual quota at present allocated to Egypt,
                                    which could not be supplied by the latter country. Then, at the
                                    beginning of the next quota year, Peru would be enabled to
                                    compete equally with Egypt for the full amount of the global
                                    quota of about 45 million pounds. It was further agreed that if
                                    the Tariff Commission made a finding of fact in a recommendation
                                    to the President regarding the consolidation of the present
                                    quotas, the President would then issue a proclamation giving
                                    effect to such recommendation, and thereafter the President of
                                    Peru would issue his proclamation of the trade agreement. On the
                                    latter point the Peruvians stated that they must be assured that
                                    the matter of the quota arrangement <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694"
                                        facs="0708"/>would be settled satisfactorily before
                                    proclaiming the agreement on their side, otherwise they would be
                                    placed in what they considered the indefensible position in Peru
                                    of having signed and put into effect an agreement including a
                                    reduction in duty on long-staple cotton which was of absolutely
                                    no value to them because of the existence of quotas which, under
                                    present conditions, would prevent the importation into the
                                    United States of a single pound of cotton for commercial
                                    purposes until the opening of the next quota year in
                                    September.</item>

                        <p>398. Trade agreement signed at noon today, including 50 percent
                            reductions in duty on long-staple cotton and sugar. In a separate
                            exchange of notes it is agreed that the Tariff Commission will be
                            requested to investigate possibility of consolidating present individual
                            country quotas on long-staple cotton into a global quota equal to the
                            sum of the individual quotas, thus permitting Peru to share in supplying
                            any otherwise unfilled portions of permitted imports. Upon a favorable
                            finding by the Tariff Commission, the President would then issue a
                            proclamation in the above sense.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: I have the honor to
                            address Your Excellency in connection with the note of June 15 last,
                            which the Uruguayan Commission for Inter-American Development addressed
                            to the Minister of Foreign Relations of my country, in which the problem
                            created for the Uruguayan producers and merchants, by reason of the
                            scarcity of warehouses, was dealt with.</p>
                        <p>It is stated in the said note that, on May 15 last, there were fifteen
                            thousand bales of wool sold and ready for shipment. The quantity in
                            question had a value of approximately ten million pesos. Those ten
                            million pesos have already been paid to the producers, without anything
                            having been collected as yet from the buyers in the interior, since the
                            financing of these purchases is on the basis of “payment against
                            shipping documents.”</p>
                        <p>As the present state of war causes a general delay of several months in
                            the shipment of wool, the bank credits which support the operations fall
                            due in the interim, thus creating a difficult situation for the
                            exporters.</p>
                        <p>In normal times, there is no difficulty in financing the operations on
                            the basis already mentioned, but at this time, the problem which has
                            been outlined causes serious disturbances for which it is necessary to
                            find a solution.</p>
                        <p>The Uruguayan Commission for Inter-American Development, complying with a
                            request of the Chamber of Commerce for Domestic Products (“Cámara
                            Mercantil de Productos del País”), suggests a formula which takes into
                            consideration the interests of our economy and those of the importers in
                            the United States:</p>
                        <p>That the sale of wool be made on the basis of “payment against documents
                            showing warehousing in private sheds, to the satisfaction <pb n="696"
                                xml:id="pg_696" facs="0710"/>of the bank concerned in the operation,
                            or in fiscal warehouses” and that this condition be made effective in
                            cases in which shipments cannot be made within ninety days of the sale.
                            If shipment is made before the ninety days are up, payments would be
                            made as they have been till now, that is to say: “against shipping
                            documents”.</p>
                        <p>A settlement of this kind with the United States would constitute a
                            solution in the case of one of the preoccupations of major importance to
                            Uruguayan domestic commerce and banking.</p>
                        <p>That is why I submit the problem in question to Your Excellency’s
                            sympathetic consideration, assuring you of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p>“Your 539 June 29,<note n="2" xml:id="d651fn2">Not printed.</note> wool
                            surplus referred to not regarded as an abnormal carry-over at this
                            period of the season. Wools finer than 44’s are exempted from M–63 until
                            August 16. As a result, private purchases have been stimulated and
                            presumably unsold balances of such grades have been reduced.</p>
                        <p>We are not desirous of acquiring Uruguayan wools at this time, but to
                            assist the situation are prepared to consider the purchase of a
                            substantial part of the exportable surplus from the current clip
                            comprising 64’s down to 46’s qualities, good combing fleeces, skirted,
                            of standard packing acceptable to United States wool trade at 10 percent
                            below current prices. This conforms with our Agreement with the British
                            Wool Control, under which we have obtained substantial supplies
                            Australian wools at lower base prices less a similar discount. It is
                            proposed to buy up to 10,000 bales of the existing exportable surplus on
                            the above basis through Boston representatives of Uruguayan shippers.
                            This is not to be construed as an intention on the part of the United
                            States to make a similar arrangement for next season’s clip, and such an
                            interpretation is to be discouraged.</p>
                        <p>It is firmly believed by our commodity authorities that all carryover of
                            this class of wool will be absorbed through usual United States trade
                            channels in due course if Uruguayan holders prefer to wait such a
                            development.</p>
                        <p>Your views on the above-mentioned proposals will be appreciated.”</p>

                        <p>683. Department’s telegram No. 471, August 3, 8 p.m. Present wool surplus
                            is estimated between 35,000 and 38,000 bales which is considered large
                            and is causing concern. An undetermined but probably considerable
                            portion of this wool is in the hands of brokers who took an
                            over-optimistic view of market and will take heavy losses if compelled
                            to sell at current United States prices. Largely as a result of this
                            situation pressure is being brought on the Uruguayan Government to
                            induce us to take the wool at prices which will insure a profit.</p>
                        <p>We cannot be expected to assume the speculative losses with which brokers
                            are threatened. However, to show our willingness to take Uruguayan wool
                            we consider it advisable that Boston houses offer to buy substantial
                            quantities on the basis and in the manner proposed in the Department’s
                            telegram. If indications are that prices will rise and that Uruguayan
                            holders stand to gain by awaiting developments, this should be pointed
                            out by the Boston houses in making their offers. Otherwise we incur the
                            risk of being accused of having squeezed the Uruguayan trade.</p>

                        <p>529. Following receipt of your no. 683, August 15, noon, interested
                            Government agencies have held a succession of meetings to discuss most
                            appropriate action to take. Consensus now definitely favors some action
                            regarding carryover and new clip as well, but all are agreed with your
                            comment regarding speculative holdings. Uruguayan wool market is out of
                            line with world prices and there is definite feeling here that
                            correction of this inconsistency would be in Uruguayan interest.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the Uruguayan Government appoint someone here in
                            Washington to begin conversations and with power to take action.</p>
                        <p>It is highly desirable that it be made clear in Montevideo that we have
                            no interest at existing prices. Should the Montevideo market approximate
                            the world price range which is substantially lower it is possible that
                            some means might be worked out to move the carryover in spite of fact
                            that Army and Navy have recently specified 100 <pb n="698"
                                xml:id="pg_698" facs="0712"/>percent domestic wools and commercial
                            demand is limited by conservation order M–73, a copy of which is being
                            despatched by air mail. Department is confident that if Montevideo
                            prices can be adjusted to world levels, other agencies may be induced to
                            place Uruguayan wool in government stockpile. If this adjustment of
                            prices should occur promptly, it would then be possible to move
                            Uruguayan wool with the present plethora of shipping now available in
                            the Plate which may not be so free at a later date.</p>
                        <p>The situation is complicated by negotiations for the Australian clip but
                            we are ready to begin conversations regarding Uruguayan carryover
                            immediately to aid movement of stocks.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Your
                            Excellency’s note of July 17, 1942, with respect to the difficulty, due
                            to the inadequacy of shipping in Montevideo, of financing wool sold and
                            ready for shipment.</p>
                        <p>This Government has been making a special effort to supply shipping space
                            for additional quantities of Uruguayan wool. With the shipping that has
                            been and is now available in the Plate, no difficulty should exist in
                            regard to financing wool, sold and ready for shipment, on the basis of
                            payment against shipping documents.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State and other interested Government agencies have on
                            numerous occasions during the past month discussed the situation
                            regarding the current Uruguayan wool market. There has been general
                            recognition of the importance of wool in the Uruguayan economy and it
                            may now be said that there is a definite intention to provide an assured
                            market through purchase by a United States Government <pb n="699"
                                xml:id="pg_699" facs="0713"/>agency, or otherwise. However, there is
                            a belief that Uruguayan interests will be best served if the Montevideo
                            market is aligned more closely to world markets.</p>
                        <p>Conversations among the several Government agencies in regard to this
                            matter are still in an exploratory stage, as are those relating to the
                            possibility of negotiating purchase agreements for Uruguayan products
                            other than wool. However, when these conversations have progressed to
                            more specific terms, the Department will advise Your Excellency.</p>

                        <p>The Uruguayan Ambassador called at his request. He brought with him five
                            members of the Commission. The Commission, the Ambassador explained, had
                            encountered difficulties in its negotiations with officers of the
                            Department but that before reporting the difficulties to Uruguay, the
                            Ambassador wished to discuss them with me to see whether they might be
                            cleared up. The difficulties appeared to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>In our note to the Ambassador of September 17 we stated that there had
                            been general recognition of the importance of wool in the Uruguayan
                            economy and that there was a definite intention to provide an assured
                            market through purchase by a United States Government agency or
                            otherwise. The note then added: “However, there is a belief that
                            Uruguayan interests will be best served if the Montevideo market is
                            aligned more closely to world markets”. A similar statement was
                            contained in a note delivered by the American Ambassador to the
                            Uruguayan Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Apparently the Uruguayans had given much study to this sentence and had
                            concluded that it meant that they were going to be paid the current
                            market price in Argentina for their wool. This seemed to their minds to
                            eliminate a negotiated price based upon the large purchase contemplated
                            and the provision of an assured market.</p>
                        <p>However, the draftsman of the note (although this is not known by the
                            Uruguayan Ambassador) had in mind that the implication of <pb n="700"
                                xml:id="pg_700" facs="0714"/>the sentence was that certain Uruguayan
                            interests which had been speculating in wool would have to be satisfied
                            with a lower price than they were then asking.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Uruguayan Ambassador what the difference was in figures
                            between his position and that of the Department. He stated that it was
                            his impression that the comparable market price in Argentina would be 37
                            to 39 cents whereas he had been offered 33 cents.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Ambassador that I was not prepared to discuss the question
                            on its merits at the present time, but that I would discuss it with the
                            officers of the Department concerned and would get in touch with him
                            later on.</p>

                            recent conversations held by the representatives of your Government and
                            of the Government of the United States of America concerning the unsold

                            Uruguayan wool clip of the 1942–1943 season. The Defense Supplies
                            Corporation, an agency of this Government, has agreed to purchase
                            Uruguayan wool of these two clips on the terms and conditions set forth
                            in the attached memorandum of understanding<note n="3" xml:id="d657fn3"
                                >Not printed; for conditions of agreement, see telegram No. 713,

                                    target="#pg_702">p. 702</ref>.</note> reached as a result of the
                            conversations referred to.</p>
                        <p>It is my hope that this agreement will aid in the stabilization of the
                            economy of Uruguay and will decrease the dislocations to its economy
                            caused by the war demand.</p>
                        <p>It has been agreed between the two Governments that they will from time
                            to time consult with the joint objective of limiting exports of wool
                            from Uruguay in such manner that Uruguayan wool required by the United
                            States of America for the conduct of the War is made available for that
                            purpose and in such manner that it does not become available, directly
                            or indirectly, for purposes disadvantageous to the conduct of the
                            War.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the agreement which has been reached between our
                            Governments substantially furthers the effectiveness of the Resolutions
                            adopted at the Third Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the

                            Government, the Defense Supplies Corporation, has agreed to buy
                            Uruguayan wool of these two crops on the terms and conditions
                            established in the annexed memorandum of the understanding reached as a
                            result of the conversations mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency indicates, further, that this agreement will contribute
                            to the stabilization of the economy of Uruguay and will reduce the
                            disturbances in its economy caused by the demands of the war.</p>
                        <p>Reference is also made in Your Excellency’s note to the agreement of both
                            Governments with respect to consultations from time to time with the
                            double purpose of limiting the wool exports of Uruguay in such manner
                            that the Uruguayan wool required by the United States of America for
                            conducting the war may be obtainable for this purpose and may not be
                            obtainable, directly or indirectly, for purposes detrimental to the
                            conduct of the war.</p>
                        <p>Taking note of these declarations, I have the pleasure to express that
                            the Government of the Republic of Uruguay shares in the statements made
                            and that it believes that the agreement which has been reached between
                            our Governments substantially broadens the efficacy of the Resolutions
                            adopted at the Third Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Relations of the
                            American Republics, held at Rio de Janeiro, and that it is a forward
                            step in the development of mutually advantageous economic relations
                            between the United States of America and the Republic of Uruguay.</p>

                            agreed to purchase not exceeding 30,000 bales of 1941–42 wool carry-over

                            of 37 cents per pound in grease c. and f. for Uruguayan Supers from
                            estimates heretofore delivered by Uruguayan Commission. All grades of
                            Bonne Belle are at 2 cents per pound less than the corresponding grades
                            of Super style. Terms of payment cash against shipping documents or, if

                        <p>303. The Department realizes from your many recent telegrams that the
                            Uruguayan Government is greatly preoccupied by the increasing
                            difficulties in shipping. The Government and exporters and importers
                            have made abundantly clear to you that they believe Uruguay is not
                            receiving as favorable treatment as other countries, particularly
                            Argentina, in space allocated on vessels in trade between the United
                            States and Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The Department and the War Shipping Administration have reviewed this
                            situation and in recent telegrams have brought about readjustments which
                            go a substantial distance toward relieving the complaints which have
                            been brought to your attention.</p>
                        <p>It is clear, however, that for some time to come there will be an extreme
                            shortage of shipping. It therefore becomes extremely urgent that the
                            four Uruguayan ships<note n="7" xml:id="d660fn7">Ships of Axis Powers
                                requisitioned by Uruguay.</note> be placed immediately into
                            efficient operation. The operation of these ships would make possible
                            the carriage of greater quantities of Uruguayan exports and imports.</p>
                        <p>There appear to be two aspects of the problem of placing the Uruguayan
                            vessels into service. One of these is fears of submarine danger. The
                            United States is now supplying petroleum to Uruguay and most of Brazil
                            by sending tankers around the west coast of <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704"
                                facs="0718"/>South America and through the Straits of Magellan. It
                            would be possible in terms of the national interest of Uruguay, if not
                            in strictly commercial shipping terms, to send Uruguayan vessels via the
                            west coast to California or Gulf ports. This less efficient utilization
                            of ships would still be vastly more helpful than their continued
                            immobilization in Uruguayan ports.</p>
                        <p>The other question is that of efficiency of operation. The Department is
                            advised that Mr. A. V. Moore of Moore-McCormack has presented to the
                            Uruguayan Government, through the Uruguayan Ambassador<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d660fn8">Juan Carlos Blanco.</note> and his Naval
                                Attaché,<note n="9" xml:id="d660fn9">Comdr. Mario Collazo
                                Pittaluga.</note> a proposal for chartering these ships. Mr. Moore
                            states that the Uruguayan Embassy here has endorsed the proposal and
                            sent it to Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>Although the Department recalls the objections previously raised by the
                            Uruguayan Government to the operation of these ships by Moore-McCormack,
                            it desires you to have a friendly but frank talk with the Foreign
                                Minister<note n="10" xml:id="d660fn10">Alberto Guani.</note> and, if
                            it seems desirable, with the President<note n="11" xml:id="d660fn11"
                                >Alfredo Baldomir.</note> to discuss the matter. In this
                            conversation you should point out that there is and will be an
                            insufficiency of tonnage, that the efficient operation of these ships
                            would make it possible for Uruguay to increase its exports and to
                            improve its imports, and that it would have a very encouraging and
                            heartening effect on our shipping authorities here who feel that Uruguay
                            is not doing as much as it could or should to help itself as long as
                            these ships remain idle or are not utilized to the maximum efficiency.
                            You may recall that this Government has not heretofore urged that these
                            ships be operated in any particular way but has merely stood on the
                            broad policy that they should be put into service. The shipping
                            situation has become so critical, however, that the Department believes
                            the Uruguayan Government in its own interest must immediately come to
                            some conclusion as to the way in which these ships would be operated.
                            The Department believes the proposal presented by Moore-McCormack
                            through the Ambassador here a fair one, recognizing the Uruguayan desire
                            for a merchant marine operated under its own flag. Opportunity would be
                            afforded for training officers and seamen. You should however emphasize
                            that our interest is in seeing the ships placed into effective service
                            promptly.</p>

                        <p>436. Department’s 303, May 27, 7 p.m. and my 433 May 29, 5 p.m. I believe
                            that Guani in particular has from the outset been concerned over the
                            eventual postwar difficulties with the owners of the requisitioned
                            vessels and their Governments. It occurs to me that our efforts to
                            induce the Uruguayan Government to transfer the vessels to American
                            operation might be materially facilitated, if by so doing Uruguay were
                            to be relieved of all responsibility as respects eventual claims. I
                            believe that it would be particularly helpful if we offered to assume in
                            Uruguay’s stead all responsibilities respect eventual claims based not
                            only on its action in transferring the vessels to United States but also
                            on its original action in requisitioning the vessels. Naturally such an
                            offer would refer only to vessels transferred to American operation.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate an early reply.</p>

                        <p>454. My telegram 433, May 29, 5 p.m. I discussed the utilization of the
                            Uruguayan vessels with Guani yesterday acquainting him with the
                            Department’s views as expressed in its telegram 303, May 27, 7 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Guani told me very frankly that there is no present likelihood that the
                            Government will change its policy of direct operation of the vessels. He
                            said that it would be inadvisable to press the matter and that
                            Moore-McCormack should remain quiet for the time being.</p>
                        <p>I feel that for the present we should confine ourselves to efforts to
                            induce the Uruguayans to operate the vessels as efficiently and
                            expeditiously as possible. The Naval Attaché and I will continue to urge
                            them to cooperate in this manner and I shall take advantage of the first
                            suitable opportunity to discuss this phase of the question with the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to recent
                            correspondence concerning the utilization and operation of Uruguayan
                            ships and in particular to the Department’s telegram No. 303 of May 27
                            and my telegram No. 454 of June 3.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my telegram No. 454, I discussed the matter on June 2 with
                            Dr. Guani in the sense of the Department’s instructions. He told me
                            frankly and categorically that the Government was not disposed for the
                            time being to make any change in its policy of operating the vessels
                            itself through the National Port Administration. As stated in my
                            telegram No. 433 of May 29, he had given me to understand a few days
                            previously that the President and Admiral Rodriguez Luis were annoyed
                            and felt that Moore-McCormack had sought to bring pressure on the
                            Government in various ways in order to obtain the Uruguayan vessels. In
                            our conversation of June 2, Dr. Guani reverted to our earlier talk in
                            terms which made it very plain that the Government is in no frame of
                            mind to give favorable consideration to any proposal from
                            Moore-McCormack whom it blames in good part for the circumstance that
                            for a time so many American vessels were sailing from Buenos Aires
                            without stopping at Montevideo for cargo. His final comment was that
                            Moore-McCormack should not press the matter further and that the best
                            thing the firm could do would be to “remain quiet”. He said that he
                            would so inform the Uruguayan Embassy in Washington through which the
                            firm’s latest proposal had been transmitted. (In this connection, I may
                            state that Moore-McCormack have recently opened their own office in
                            Montevideo under an American manager, a move which, it is hoped, will
                            tend gradually to improve their position here.)</p>
                        <p>In view of my conversation with Dr. Guani, I considered it distinctly
                            inadvisable to pursue further the question of the Moore-McCormack
                            proposal or even to suggest for the time being the possibility of an
                            offer for charter or purchase of the vessels by the United States on the
                            basis set forth in the Department’s telegram No. 324 of June 4. I am
                            satisfied that for the moment nothing would be accomplished and useless
                            irritation might be caused by further efforts to obtain the vessels, in
                            the absence of some indication that the Government <pb n="708"
                                xml:id="pg_708" facs="0722"/>may be prepared to reconsider its
                            determination to operate the ships itself. I am the more convinced of
                            the present inadvisability of such efforts in view of what the Naval
                            Attaché tells me of his conversations with naval officers and officials
                            of the Port Administration. He has the distinct impression that they are
                            very “touchy” on the subject of the vessels and strongly in favor of
                            continued Uruguayan operation.</p>
                        <p>This does not, however, preclude suitable efforts on our part to induce
                            the Uruguayans to operate the ships expeditiously and efficiently. I
                            have talked with Dr. Guani along these lines and on June 11 I took
                            advantage of an opportunity to impress on Admiral Rodriguez Luis the
                            seriousness of the shipping situation and the great importance of more
                            effective utilization of Uruguay’s tonnage. The Naval Attaché is
                            assisting me in endeavoring to obtain the cooperation of the Uruguayan
                            authorities in this manner.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Present Situation as regards Uruguayan Vessels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As was duly reported by the Naval Attaché and noted in my telegram No.
                            433 of May 29, two of the Uruguayan vessels, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Colonia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Presidente Terra</hi>
                            finally sailed for United States east coast ports on May 24.</p>
                        <p>Repairs on the <hi rend="italic">Maldonado</hi> (which is reported to
                            have been in bad shape) were recently completed. The vessel has made a
                            successful trial run, is to begin loading tomorrow, and is scheduled to
                            sail for the United States about July 2.</p>
                        <p>After considerable delay (which appears to have been due largely to
                            hestitation or procrastination on the part of Dr. Guani), the <hi
                                rend="italic">Tacoma</hi> is now being turned over by the Navy to
                            the National Port Administration with orders to proceed to place it in
                            operation. The Naval Attaché informs me that no inspection has been made
                            thus far to determine the condition of the vessel with particular
                            reference to damage which may have been done by the former German crew.
                            The Naval Attaché has repeatedly urged that such an inspection be made
                            promptly. He now understands that it will be made within a few days as
                            soon as the National Port Administration takes the vessel over from the
                            Navy.</p>
                        <p>A further vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Punta del Este</hi> (the former
                            Dutch <hi rend="italic">Vredenburg</hi>), will shortly be put into
                            service. This is not one of the immobilized vessels taken over by the
                            Uruguayan Government but a ship which went on the rocks off Punta del
                            Este in 1939, was salvaged by the National Port Administration, and has
                            been repaired in the Uruguayan Naval Dockyard. Incidentally, American
                            experts agree that the Uruguayan Navy has done a remarkably good job in
                            repairing what appeared to be little more than a useless hulk.</p>

                                <p>“I have the honor to refer to the discussions during the course
                                    of the negotiation of the trade agreement between the Oriental
                                    Republic of Uruguay and the United States of America, during
                                    which it was understood that the Government of the United States
                                    would agree to the deletion of paragraph 1 of article XVI
                                    relating to customs penalties for errors in documentation,
                                    subject to the condition that assurances be given by the
                                    Uruguayan Government that sympathetic consideration will be
                                    given to claims of North American exporters resulting from the
                                    imposition of customs penalties.</p>
                                <p>In the course of the discussions it was pointed out that the
                                    basic customs laws of Uruguay do not permit the consideration of
                                    good faith where errors in documentation have occurred, but
                                    Uruguayan customs legislation authorizes the correction of
                                    errors in documentation within given periods before the consular
                                    authorities of the port of embarkation as well as before the
                                    customs authorities of the port of destination. Moreover my
                                    Government assures Your Excellency’s Government that sympathetic
                                    consideration will be given to cases where North American
                                    exporters might be prejudiced through unintentional errors in
                                    the original documents which accompany the merchandise
                                    shipped.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. Henry telephoned from Buenos Aires to report further regarding the
                            present status of our trade agreement negotiations with Uruguay in which
                            he has been participating in Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>As regards Schedule I, Mr. Henry said that the Uruguayans had met all of
                            our requests excepting (1) filing cabinets and radio receivers on which
                            bindings of the present duties were offered and (2) automobile parts on
                            which reductions covering about 60 percent of the total, by value, were
                            offered. Mr. Henry was informed that these offers would have to be
                            cleared with the Committee on Trade Agreements but that we believed they
                            would be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henry was reminded of the fact that the Embassy should check with the
                            Uruguayan authorities to ensure that in the signed agreement Part B of
                            Schedule I includes only “item numbers of the unrevised sections of the
                            Uruguayan tariff in force on the day of the signature of the agreement”
                            as provided for in the headnote thereto.</p>
                        <p>In response to an inquiry, Mr. Henry stated that the Uruguayan Government
                            desired that the note regarding customs penalties, transmitted to the
                            Department in telegram no. 355 of May 9, 1942 from the Embassy at
                            Montevideo, not be published. It was suggested in that event that the
                            substance of the note be embodied in another paragraph <pb n="712"
                                xml:id="pg_712" facs="0726"/>of the Final Minutes, since we
                            preferred not to have any unpublished exchanges of notes in connection
                            with the agreement.</p>
                        <p>He was informed that while we preferred a Final Minute, he was
                            authorized, if necessary, to accept the Uruguayan proposal of an
                            unpublished exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the Embassy at Montevideo was preparing a definitive text
                            for transmission to the Department within a few days and that it was
                            hoped that signature of the agreement would be possible within about two
                            weeks.</p>

                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Uruguay was issued on May
                            13, 1941 and public hearings were held on June 23, 24, and 25
                            concurrently with those in connection with the trade agreement with
                            Argentina because of the similarity of products on which concessions
                            might be granted to the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Agreement has now been reached with the Uruguayan Government on all
                            substantive points in connection with the proposed agreement.</p>
                        <p>Improved tariff treatment is provided for in Schedule I of the agreement
                            on 147 Uruguayan tariff items covering about 25 percent by value of
                            total United States exports to Uruguay in 1940.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the binding on the free list of unmanufactured
                            agates, all of the concessions to be granted Uruguay in Schedule II are
                            also included in the existing trade agreement with Argentina. The
                            principal products are casein, tallow, canned meat, flaxseed, coarse
                            wools, and cattle hides. The concessions cover products which in 1940
                            accounted for about 32 percent by value of total United States imports
                            from Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The general provisions, related notes, and final minutes are similar to
                            those contained in the trade agreement with Argentina. As in the case of
                            Argentina, two related notes provide that the terms of the agreement
                            providing for nondiscriminatory treatment will not be invoked in respect
                            of certain special exchange treatment accorded <pb n="714"
                                xml:id="pg_714" facs="0728"/>temporarily by Uruguay to the sterling
                            area or in respect of certain special advantages accorded by Uruguay to
                            specified neighboring countries. In the case of Argentina these
                            neighboring countries are countries contiguous to Argentina and Peru; in
                            the case of Uruguay they include contiguous countries, Bolivia, and
                            Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate being informed whether you approve the conclusion of
                            this agreement as outlined above.<note n="29" xml:id="d671fn29">Original

                        <p>606. Reference Department’s 442, July 18, 4 p.m., second paragraph. The
                            understanding with the Uruguayans is that the general provisions,
                            schedule I and II will be bound together in the order named and that the
                            related notes will be signed and exchanged separately at the same time
                            as the signature of the agreement, as was done in the case of the
                            Argentine agreement. The Final Minutes will also be kept separate. In
                            giving the texts to the press for publication, it is intended that the
                            Uruguayan note relating to preferences to the United Kingdom and the
                            reply thereto will precede that regarding preferences to contiguous
                            countries and our reply.</p>
                        <p>If the foregoing is not satisfactory to the Department, it will be
                            necessary to discuss this point with the Foreign Office and to obtain
                            its approval for binding new signature texts of the related notes and
                            replies thereto with the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Please clarify immediately the Department’s wishes with respect to the
                            foregoing.</p>

                            business men. Guani and I made brief remarks both stressing importance
                            of unconditional most favored nation clause as means of assuring
                            improved trade relations in better future world. Guani paid tribute to

                        <p>270. The Uruguayan Government is considering a program of public works as
                            a means of solving in part the unemployment problem which will become
                            serious as increasing numbers of laborers are thrown out of work because
                            of shortage of essential materials. The financing of such public works
                            will be difficult in view of the fiscal situation. According to reports
                            believed reliable 1941 closed with a deficit of from 12 to 15 million
                            pesos and a still larger deficit is anticipated for 1942.</p>
                        <p>In order to maintain political stability it is most important that work
                            be found for the unemployed and I believe that the Government will be
                            compelled to resort to public works and particularly such works as road
                            building which do not require imported materials. In view of our desire
                            to assist Uruguay and our inability to supply it with enough raw
                            materials to prevent serious unemployment, it occurs to me that we might
                            be prepared to offer the Government financial assistance for public
                            works. To be effective such assistance should be of a very generous
                            nature as respects terms.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate early advices from the Department as to whether our
                            Government could consider lending appropriate assistance and in this
                            event whether I am authorized to discuss the matter with Guani<note

                            be an appropriate time for a spontaneous gesture on our part along these
                            lines.</p>

                        <p>195. Your 270, April 9, 5 p.m. The Government of the United States is
                            always prepared to consider and discuss any measures of cooperation
                            suggested to it by the Government of Uruguay. Some time ago at the
                            request of the then Uruguayan Minister there were opened credit lines by
                            the Export-Import Bank to the Government of Uruguay and to the Banco de
                            la República. Uruguay has never made any attempt to utilize these.</p>
                        <p>The credit standing of Uruguay is good and the Department is prepared to
                            recommend and the Export-Import Bank to consider any reasonable program
                            of financing. The priority situation would make it very difficult to
                            supply Uruguay with materials needed for any extensive public works
                            program, but your telegram indicates that public works to be carried out
                            would not require imported materials.</p>

                        <p>364. From Spaeth<note n="34" xml:id="d678fn34">Carl B. Spaeth, member of
                                the Emergency Advisory Committee for Political Defense.</note> for
                            the Under Secretary. The intimate relations between the economic
                            situation here in Uruguay and the political objectives which we are
                            seeking to accomplish in cooperation with Doctor Guani induces this
                            special reference to economic matters. Almost every day the Foreign
                            Minister renders some significant assistance to the work of the
                            Committee and we will, of course, be increasingly dependent upon him and
                            the Government of Uruguay. This aid in political matters would seem to
                            justify the viewpoint that special efforts should be made to guard
                            against unemployment and economic unrest. The Ambassador and his staff
                            are properly concerned about the economic problems which are developing
                            as a result of inadequate shipping facilities, the iron and steel
                            allocation and the lack of [apparent omission]. These problems are, of
                            course, common to the hemisphere, but I am satisfied that Uruguay is in
                            a particularly vulnerable position at a time when we badly need her
                            political assistance and when it is particularly important that Uruguay
                            appears to receive substantially better treatment than Argentina.</p>
                        <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0732"/>
                        <p>With regard to shipping, special care should be taken to insure that
                            boats over which we have control take more or at least as much cargo
                            from Montevideo as they take from Buenos Aires. Even better shipping
                            treatment might be justified for Uruguay in view of the substantial
                            number of Argentine ships which are able to sail safely without
                            convoy.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the fuel supply it is important to stress that unlike
                            other South American countries Uruguay has no domestic fuel resources
                            whatsoever. It has no coal, no petroleum and no natural forests. Recent
                            quotations on Argentine wood for fuel purposes go as high as 48 pesos a
                            ton.</p>
                        <p>With regard to iron and steel the Embassy advises me that on a
                            comparative basis with Argentina, Uruguay’s very small allocation for
                            the second quarter indicates that it is not being given the preferential
                            treatment which her political leadership on our behalf would seem to
                            justify. It is true that most of the iron and steel is for construction,
                            but our Government is well aware of the importance of the building
                            industry to the economy of the country, and is also aware of the absence
                            of any alternative employment for the thousands of workers employed in
                            that industry. It should be emphasized also that the amount required to
                            bring Uruguay’s allocation to the minimum recommended in the Embassy’s
                            survey would be insignificant in comparison with the political damage
                            that will ensue from the present drastic curtailment. In order to be
                            certain that we are effectively implementing our policy as to Argentina
                            by giving Uruguay preferential treatment and in order that the
                            assistance of Uruguay in political matters may be given its appropriate
                            recognition, I strongly urge an overall reexamination of the economic
                            assistance projected for Uruguay during the next 6 months. [Spaeth.]</p>

                        <p>283. Your 364, May 13, 3 p.m. For Spaeth from the Under Secretary. I am
                            grateful for your frank expression of views and agree heartily in
                            general with them. I realize that Guani and the Uruguayan Government
                            have taken a strong position of leadership and are of important
                            assistance to us every day. I also know that the proximity of Argentina
                            makes for constant comparison of treatment accorded the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>You realize, of course, that the existence of the Argentine merchant
                            marine which is able to sail without danger while the few Uruguayan <pb

                            burden on United States controlled shipping to take care of Uruguay.
                            Also it is a fact that there is a greater proportion of strategic
                            materials to be lifted at Buenos Aires than at Montevideo. Finally the
                            Argentine Central Bank has done an excellent piece of work in justifying
                            its material requirements, while the reports and information of the
                            Uruguayan Government has frequently been deficient in ways which have
                            led the War Production Board to question them. Moreover, the existence
                            of a very large number of outstanding export licenses has hampered the
                            inauguration of the effects of the special Argentine export control
                            measures with which you are very familiar. This last problem is now
                            partially being overcome by the reexamination by BEW<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d679fn36">Board of Economic Warfare.</note> of the old

                                <item>Definite arrangements with War Shipping Administration so that
                                    each United States controlled vessel will bring important cargo
                                    to Uruguay and lift a reasonable tonnage of strategic and
                                    critical items. You have been extensively informed about the
                                    plans. The Department hopes that at least as much will be lifted
                                    from Montevideo as Buenos Aires in spite of the relative
                                    proportions and importance of the available cargoes, and expects
                                    that large inroads will be made in present accumulations. It
                                    must, of course, be emphasized that the broad shipping picture
                                    is very grave and security problems are real. The Department
                                    will send you full instructions regarding the shipping situation
                                    in the near future.</item>

                            reporting that the Uruguayan Government is seeking funds for deficit
                            financing you state that you will endeavor to keep the Department
                            informed of the situation and that a thorough study of the Uruguayan
                            Government’s fiscal position is to be prepared in the near future.</p>
                        <p>While it is evident from reports on file that the fiscal position of
                            Uruguay has deteriorated somewhat during the past two years, it is not
                            readily apparent why the Uruguayan Government should no longer be in a
                            position to raise funds for deficit financing locally with the
                            assistance of the Banco de la República, or why additional dollar
                            credits should be required at a time when the Uruguayan exchange
                            position is unusually strong. According to recent advice, money is
                            plentiful in Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>It is requested that in addition to setting forth the nature and causes
                            of the present crisis, you indicate in your report the trend of
                            government finances in the light of current shipping developments and

                            in the Embassy’s telegram No. 270 of April 9, 1942 and any other

                            Government’s fiscal problem. The Department also desires to know the

                        <p>575. President Baldomir sent for me yesterday and together with Minister
                            of Finance stated that Government wished to explore possibility of
                            obtaining from Export-Import Bank or other source a loan of $30,000,000
                            for financing public works. He said that loan would be applicable to new
                            projects, chiefly roads, for which Council of State has just approved a
                            new bond issue of 33,000,000 pesos and in addition to Carrasco Airport
                            and other public works previously authorized, he stressed need for
                            public works to relieve unemployment and prevent social unrest. He
                            stated that loans to cover budget deficits will be floated locally but
                            that domestic market is unable to furnish the additional funds required
                            for public works. Further details, together with reply to Department’s
                            instruction 617 of June 12th by next courier.</p>

                        <p>432. Your 575, July 11, 1 p.m. The Department will wait for further
                            details which you mention before taking the matter up with the
                            Export-Import Bank. The Department’s preliminary general views are as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>It would be disposed to recommend any reasonable credit
                                    proposal, and has confidence that Uruguay will request and
                                    utilize only such credits as would be directly productive or
                                    necessary to maintain <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0736"
                                    />the economic and political stability of the country. The
                                    willingness of the United States to extend appropriate credits
                                    to Uruguay has been evidenced on several occasions over the last
                                    few years, and the conservative policy of Uruguay with respect
                                    to utilizing credits has been evidenced by the fact that none of
                                    the credits extended by the Export-Import Bank have ever been
                                    used.</item>

                                <item>The amount of $30,000,000 seems quite large, especially for
                                    public works.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The real limitation on the construction of public works will
                                    be the question of materials and equipment necessary to carry
                                    out the projects. The military program has recently been greatly
                                    augmented and all of the past difficulties of obtaining supplies
                                    in the United States will be correspondingly increased.
                                    Financing of public works is thus definitely secondary to the
                                    obtaining of material for their completion. If your despatch
                                    does not already do so, please inform the Department in detail
                                    as to the amounts of materials which it would be anticipated
                                    will have to be imported from the United States to carry out the

                        <p>569. Reference is made to your despatches and reports regarding the
                            contemplated request of the Uruguayan Government for a loan from the
                            Export-Import Bank for public works. Department has discussed this
                            matter fully with Export-Import Bank and War Production Board and has
                            reached the conclusion that it will be impossible to secure the
                            materials (especially the iron and steel) required for the program as
                            set out in your reports.<note n="40" xml:id="d683fn40">Reports giving
                                details of program not printed.</note> Both the Department and the
                            Export-Import Bank would be pleased to discuss with Uruguayan officials
                            the revision of outstanding credits to Uruguay totalling $19,500,000
                            which have not as yet been utilized or the granting of additional
                            credits. However, it should be made clear to Uruguayan officials that
                            these conversations will have to be based upon the understanding that
                            projects of the type contained in your report calling for large amounts
                            of iron and steel from this country cannot be undertaken at this time
                            due to the requirements of the war effort.</p>
                        <p>You should endeavor, if possible, to have the Uruguayans plan a public
                            works program utilizing much less iron and steel and other <pb n="723"
                                xml:id="pg_723" facs="0737"/>scarce materials and have them request
                            aid in financing such program formally through official channels.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that little would be gained by sending a
                            representative of the Bank to Uruguay as Uruguay has able engineers who
                            could make any necessary reports and that sending someone would raise
                            false hopes.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss this matter with appropriate Uruguayan officials and
                            report to the Department.</p>

                                        highly flexible and will be adjusted to availability of

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my airgram
                            A–81 and my despatch no. 1642 both of September 26, 1942,<note n="41"
                                xml:id="d686fn41">Latter not printed.</note> and to previous
                            correspondence concerning the desire of the Uruguayan Government to
                            obtain a loan for financing public works.</p>
                        <p>Reference is made also to the Department’s telegram no. 610 of October 10
                            stating, in reply to my query, that it prefers that the official request
                            for a loan be taken up in Washington through the Uruguayan
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>As explained in the closing paragraph of my despatch no. 1642, this point
                            had been left in abeyance in the memorandum which I handed President
                            Baldomir on September 24.</p>
                        <p>Following the receipt of the Department’s telegram no. 610, I prepared a
                            supplementary memorandum recalling the suggestion that the Uruguayan
                            Government prepare a program requiring very much smaller quantities of
                            iron and steel and adding that, as respects <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725"
                                facs="0739"/>financial assistance desired in carrying out this
                            program, the Department of State suggested that appropriate official
                            negotiations be initiated in Washington through the Uruguayan Embassy.
                            (A copy and an English translation of this memorandum are enclosed for
                            the Department’s files.<note n="42" xml:id="d686fn42">Not
                                printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>This supplementary memorandum (together with a copy of the memorandum of
                            September 24) was handed to Dr. Guani, who had been absent in Chile at
                            the time of my interview with the President. I requested Dr. Guani to
                            bring the matter to the President’s attention.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago, the Director of Public Credit, Sr. Juan Ferrando,
                            telephoned me on another matter and mentioned incidentally that a
                            memorandum was being prepared by direction of the President regarding a
                            revised public works program and would be sent me shortly. I took
                            occasion to inform him that the memorandum should be transmitted to the
                            Uruguayan Ambassador in Washington through whom the official request for
                            aid in financing was to be made. (A copy of the memorandum will,
                            however, be sent me for my information.)</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, I had an opportunity to see the President and I took advantage
                            of the interview to make it very clear that the next step in the loan
                            discussions should be taken in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The President gave me to understand that appropriate instructions would
                            be sent to Ambassador Blanco<note n="43" xml:id="d686fn43">Juan Carlos
                                Blanco, Urguayan Ambassador in the United States.</note> in due
                            course. He referred again to the flexibility of the Government’s public
                            works program and the consequent possibility of adjusting the work in
                            large measure to the materials which may be available at the particular
                            time. He stressed the need for assistance with a view to stimulating and
                            strengthening the local bond market which is being called upon to take
                            considerable quantities of Government securities. The Government will
                            rely on Uruguayan sources for the great bulk of its financing but
                            desires some assistance from us in order to prevent any undue depression
                            of the domestic market.</p>
                        <p>As already stated in my despatch no. 1642, I feel strongly that, in view
                            of the circumstances surrounding the proposed loan and the purpose for
                            which it is desired, any contract between the Uruguayan Government and
                            the Export-Import Bank should give the Government sufficient latitude to
                            use the funds when and where needed.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: With reference to my despatch no.
                            1807 of November 11, 1942, and my letter to you of the same date,<note
                                n="44" xml:id="d687fn44">Letter not printed.</note> regarding the
                            proposed loan to Uruguay for public works:</p>
                        <p>As you no doubt know, Dr. Guani expects to visit Washington in January.
                            Naturally, he wants to bring back something tangible and it has occurred
                            to me that the proposed loan would be most indicated. I discussed the
                            matter with him yesterday and he was of course very pleased with the
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that in the circumstances he will not send any instructions to
                            Ambassador Blanco to take the matter up with the Department. I pointed
                            out, however, that, in order to pave the way for his own negotiations,
                            it would be most helpful if he would let me have as soon as possible the
                            memorandum desired by the Department with respect to the public works
                            planned and the quantities of iron and steel required.</p>
                        <p>I shall follow this up and endeavor to obtain and transmit the memorandum
                            to you as soon as practicable.</p>
                        <p>I trust that the course proposed will meet with your approval and that
                            matters may be so arranged as to enable Dr. Guani to obtain the loan
                            while in Washington.</p>
                        <p>An alternative course would have been to have Ambassador Blanco initiate
                            the negotiations and let Dr. Guani conclude them. I seriously question,
                            however, whether in that case Dr. Guani would be assured the credit
                            which we would like to see him have.</p>
                        <p>With cordial personal regards,</p>

                            works. I quite agree with your suggestion that it would be desirable to
                            have the loan agreement concluded by Dr. Guani on the occasion of his
                            visit to Washington next January.</p>

                            respect to the public works program is received here, it will be
                            submitted to the Export-Import Bank with the request that the Bank draw
                            up a draft of an agreement. This can then be sent to you for
                            presentation to President Baldomir and Dr. Guani, and if it meets with
                            their approval, can be prepared for formal signing by Dr. Guani in this
                            country.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Larry</hi>: With reference to your letter of
                            November 30 in reply to mine of November 14 regarding the proposed
                            Export-Import Bank loan to Uruguay for public works:</p>
                        <p>The memorandum which President Baldomir was to have had prepared
                            regarding the revised program and the quantities of iron and steel
                            required has at length been received from Dr. Guani. It proved to be
                            very disappointing and illustrates again our extreme difficulties in
                            obtaining a well-documented proposition from the Uruguayans. The trouble
                            lies partly in the lack of coordination among the various government
                            offices concerned.…</p>
                        <p>In view of the character of this memorandum, I fear that in the time that
                            remains before Dr. Guani’s arrival in the United States it will be
                            impossible to present to the Export-Import Bank a detailed program to be
                            approved in advance of granting the loan. I am nevertheless transmitting
                            a copy of the original Spanish text, together with a translation, for
                            what the information may be worth—and also for the files, in case
                            reference were to be made to the memorandum subsequently. In an effort
                            to supply some of the missing information, Dr. Gilmore<note n="46"
                                xml:id="d689fn46">Eugene A. Gilmore, Senior Economic Analyst.</note>
                            of my staff has prepared a supplementary and much more useful memorandum
                            which I also enclose.<note n="47" xml:id="d689fn47">Neither memorandum
                                printed.</note> He concludes that while the program as now described
                            in the Uruguayan memorandum does not clearly involve the substantial
                            reduction in iron and steel requirements which was requested, it is
                            still of such a flexible character that, given financial assistance, the
                            Uruguayan Government can proceed without much reference to materials
                            shortages. As I have stated in previous letters and despatches it seems
                            entirely possible and desirable to omit the question of imported
                            materials from consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0742"/>
                        <p>Since the presentation of a detailed program for approval in advance
                            appears out of the question within the time available, I would like to
                            inquire whether, as I understand from Dr. Spaeth was done in the case of
                            Venezuela, it would be possible for the Export-Import Bank to open a
                            blanket credit for public works—if necessary with the provision that the
                            funds would be made available upon subsequent approval of the projects
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Some arrangement of this sort appears to offer the most promising
                            possibility of concluding a loan during Dr. Guani’s visit, and also of
                            giving the Uruguayan Government something tangible upon which to base
                            its calculations for the ensuing fiscal year. Whether or not it would be
                            acceptable to the Uruguayans would probably depend largely upon the
                            extent to which the Export-Import Bank insists upon detailed supervision
                            of the subsequent expenditures. As I have previously stated, a
                            considerable amount of liberty of action will have to be left to the
                            Uruguayan Government in expending the funds. A method of control
                            requiring detailed prior surveys of projects to be financed would, I
                            believe, prove impracticable. Some form of certification that the funds
                            have been expended for the intended purpose would probably be as far as
                            it would be possible to go. I would greatly appreciate knowing as soon
                            as possible (1) whether a blanket credit of this type could be granted,
                            and (2) the nature of the minimum control procedures which the
                            Export-Import Bank would require.</p>
                        <p>I am of course continuing my efforts to obtain from the Uruguayans a more
                            adequate presentation of their loan application. It would probably be
                            helpful if I might have samples of documents presented to the
                            Export-Import Bank in connection with previous loan applications of a
                            similar character.</p>
                        <p>I may add that Dr. Guani suggested the other day that the matter could be
                            handled more easily if, instead of lending Uruguay funds for public
                            works, we would acquire some of Uruguay’s bond issues which have not
                            been marketed and are still in the hands of the Government or Government
                            institutions. He said that this would achieve the desired result of
                            reducing the pressure on the local bond market. I told him that I did
                            not consider this practicable. (As I understand it, the Export-Import
                            Bank could not or would not consider an operation of this sort, and
                            according to our information it is quite unlikely than any commercial
                            bank would be interested.)</p>
                        <p>For the record, the Uruguayan memorandum and Dr. Gilmore’s memorandum are
                            being transmitted under cover of a despatch (no. 1930 of December
                                11<note n="48" xml:id="d689fn48">Not printed.</note>). An extra copy
                            of the despatch is attached to this letter—and the original and usual

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Pierson</hi>: Reference is made to
                            discussions between officers of the Department and officers of the
                            Export-Import Bank regarding the desire of the Government of Uruguay to
                            obtain a loan of $7,500,000 from the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>As you remember, the initial informal request of the Government of
                            Uruguay called for a loan of $30,000,000 for a public works program,
                            requiring large amounts of iron and steel and other materials in short
                            supply in the United States. The Department informed the Government of
                            Uruguay that it would be impossible to supply the necessary materials
                            from the United States due to the exigencies of the war effort. The
                            Government of Uruguay agreed to revise the public works program reducing
                            the amount of the credit requested to $7,500,000 and stating that any
                            requests for iron and steel or other scarce materials would be taken out
                            of the over-all allocations of such products made to Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The Department informed the Government of Uruguay that the Export-Import
                            Bank would be pleased to consider such a request if formally submitted
                            by the Government of Uruguay. Word has been received from Ambassador
                            Dawson that the Foreign Minister of Uruguay will arrive in the United
                            States about January 18 and that he has expressed a desire to conclude
                            negotiations for this credit during his visit here, which will be of
                            approximately five days duration.</p>
                        <p>In view of the leadership which the Uruguayan Government has displayed in
                            connection with hemisphere matters and the great assistance which that
                            country has rendered to the United States, the Department recommends
                            that the Export-Import Bank be prepared to conclude an agreement with
                            the Government of Uruguay for the extension of a credit of $7,500,000
                            during the Foreign Minister’s visit to this country. The Department
                            feels that this agreement should give the Uruguayan Government
                            sufficient latitude to use the funds for public works or other projects
                            deemed desirable by that Government.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bill</hi>: I write with reference to your
                            letter of December 11, 1942 which enclosed the memorandum submitted to
                            you by the Uruguayan Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department has transmitted copies of the memorandum to the
                            Export-Import Bank and has addressed a letter to Mr. Pierson requesting
                            the Bank to draw up a contract which would be ready for Dr. Guani to
                            sign during his stay in this country. I am confident that the contract
                            will be satisfactory to the Uruguayans, and I therefore feel that the
                            negotiations can be speedily concluded while Dr. Guani is here. I do not
                            believe that there will be time to send a copy of the proposed contract
                            to Uruguay before Dr. Guani’s trip, but I am certain that the two
                            questions which you pose on the second page of your letter can be
                            provided for satisfactorily. Dr. Guani should bring with him certified
                            copies of laws or decrees empowering the executive to contract a foreign
                            loan and his authorization to sign the proposed contract for
                            $7,500,000.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that it will be necessary to obtain from the Uruguayans
                            any additional memoranda as the Department and the Bank know in general
                            the purposes of the credit, and the question of materials to be imported
                            from the United States has already been made clear to the Uruguayan
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>38. For Duggan. Coincidently with the receipt of your letter of January
                            2, Guani mentioned to Spaeth and to me a tentative proposal under which
                            he would take up in Washington the question of a 50 million dollar loan
                            for a 5-year public works program.</p>
                        <p>On being apprised of the contents of your letter and our doubts
                            concerning a 50 million project, he said that he would not present the
                            50 million proposal but would like to discuss in Washington the
                            possibility of obtaining later as needed a complementary loan or
                            loans.</p>
                        <p>Guani recognized gracefully that the sum of 7½ millions is even somewhat
                            in excess of the 10 million pesos which President Baldomir <pb n="731"
                                xml:id="pg_731" facs="0745"/>suggested to me as necessary. He said
                            however that the President had underestimated the country’s needs and
                            had considered the matter from the viewpoint of the outgoing rather than
                            the incoming administration. He said that he would discuss the situation
                            with President-elect Amezaga.</p>
                        <p>This morning Guani told me that Amezaga appreciates our willingness to
                            assist and understands fully that the figure of 7½ million is in
                            accordance with Baldomir’s suggestion but that he feels that it is
                            inadequate and hopes that considerably more can be obtained. Guani
                            mentioned 25 millions which might be made available in two
                            installments.</p>
                        <p>Spaeth and I both feel that in order to maintain Uruguay’s fiscal and
                            economic situation and also for the domestic and international political
                            effect, the loan contract to be signed by Guani in Washington should be
                            for a larger sum. We recommend that the amount of the loan to be granted
                            immediately be substantially increased and that in addition some formula
                            be worked out which, without involving us in a firm commitment, will
                            indicate our willingness to give due consideration to Uruguay’s future
                            needs up to some specific sum. Spaeth suggests something along the lines
                            of the arrangement which he understands was made with Bolivia.<note

                            copy of the covering note<note n="53" xml:id="d693fn53">Neither

                            memorandum to the Uruguayan Ambassador. There is also enclosed a
                            translation of a communication of December 3, 1941<note n="54"
                                xml:id="d693fn54">Not printed.</note> addressed by the Rione to the
                            German consortium which is at present working on the Rione project,
                            notifying the consortium that the Rione expects totally to rescind its
                            contract with the consortium if it has not delivered in Uruguay before
                            June 1, 1942 all the machinery, equipment and materials that are now
                            lacking for total compliance with the contract.</p>
                        <p>The status of the enclosed tentative memorandum of agreement and of the
                            arrangements which it contemplates is as follows: The Department agreed
                            with the Uruguayan Ambassador and General Giorgi to accept the wording
                            of the enclosed memorandum, and Señor Giorgi has obtained the approval
                            of the Rione for this purpose. This wording has also now been accepted
                            tentatively by Mr. D. M. Simmons of the General Cable Corporation,
                            representing the consortium of manufacturers in the United States that
                            would provide equipment to the Rione, subject to the approval of a
                            meeting of representatives of all the companies comprising the
                            consortium, which is scheduled for January 6, 1942. The Department has
                            entered into discussions with the Office of Production Management and
                            the Board of Economic Warfare with a view to obtaining a definite
                            confirmation, under the changed circumstances resulting from the
                            involvement of the United States in war, of the priority rating
                            tentatively obtained on behalf of the consortium of United States
                            manufacturers and the Rione in August 1941.</p>
                        <p>Señor Giorgi has entered tentatively into discussions with the
                            Export-Import Bank with a view to obtaining credits for the works
                            definitely provided for in the proposed memorandum of agreement, and he
                            is also entering into tentative discussions with the consortium of
                            United States manufacturers with a view to the conclusion of a contract
                            with them at an appropriate time after conclusion of the memorandum of
                            agreement with this Government.</p>
                        <p>Señor Giorgi mentioned, in preliminary discussions with the Export-Import
                            Bank, that it was expected that the works definitely contemplated by the
                            proposed memorandum of agreement would cost <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733"
                                facs="0747"/>between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000 and that
                            approximately twenty percent of this amount would be for local
                            expenditures in Uruguay. Mr. Warren L. Pierson, President of the
                            Export-Import Bank, commented with respect to this information that it
                            is a policy of the Export-Import Bank to avoid wherever possible the
                            extension of credits for expenditures in local currencies. Señor Giorgi
                            replied that he would take up with the Rione the possibility of
                            obtaining credits in Uruguay for the local expenditures.</p>

                            offered, the chief thereof with small auxiliary personnel should come to
                            Venezuela with authority to enter into definite arrangements concerning

                            declared it indispensable that the chief have this knowledge to obtain

                            facilitated by the signature of the Agreement in question, its shipment

                        <p>The Venezuelan Ambassador called this morning at my request. I discussed
                            with him the question of military and naval assistance for his country
                            which formed the subject of his conversation with Assistant Secretary
                            Berle on February 24.<note n="6" xml:id="d699fn6">Memorandum of

                        <p>I stated to him that the battery of 155 mm. guns was due at Venezuela in
                            about 10 days and that the four AT–6 advanced training planes should
                            arrive very soon since his Government had now indicated the field at
                            which these planes should alight.<note n="7" xml:id="d699fn7">For

                            Captain Schuirmann<note n="8" xml:id="d699fn8">Capt. Roscoe Schuirmann
                                of the Office of Naval Operations.</note> this morning, I told the
                            Ambassador that the Navy is taking intensive measures to patrol the
                            coast of Venezuela and the surrounding waters both with Army and Navy
                            planes and with ships of the United States and of other Allied nations.
                            In order to render this patrol more effective, a high ranking officer,
                            Bear Admiral Oldendorf, has been sent to Curaçao. I added that the Navy
                            was also investigating the possibility of arranging for calls to be made
                            by some of these planes at Venezuelan airfields.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired whether the Military Attaché at Caracas could not
                            be instructed to discuss defense measures directly with the Venezuelan
                            Minister of War. I replied that the War Department would be pleased to
                            issue such instructions to the Military Attaché but pointed out that the
                            latter might not possess complete information on all subjects, and that
                            for this reason the Army considered it preferable <pb n="739"

                            to be stationed at Panama for direct consultation with General

                                Commanding General, Caribbean Defense Command.</note> I told the
                            Ambassador that this suggestion had already been submitted to his
                            Government, to which he replied that he had heard nothing about it.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the conversation I told the Ambassador of the importance of
                            the Gulf of Paria and that this area was being given very close
                            attention by our military and naval authorities.</p>
                        <p>In response to my inquiry concerning Patos Island, the Ambassador replied
                            that he had heard that this island had been definitely placed under
                            Venezuelan sovereignty. He added that it was only a small rock and
                            apparently did not realize its importance for military purposes.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me that he had received from the Venezuelan Consul at
                            Cayenne information indicating that the French officials in that city
                            are extremely pro-Nazi and that German submarines had been refueling at
                            the small town of Mana on the border of Surinam.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Manrique Pacanins called at Mr. Bonsal’s invitation. He said that he
                            was here for reasons of health and not officially, but that he was
                            taking advantage of his stay here to renew acquaintances with various
                            members of the Government and to meet others.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Manrique Pacanins said that it had been for sometime the desire of
                            the Venezuelan Government to establish closer and sounder relationships
                            with the oil companies which would give the Venezuelan Government a
                            greater participation in the profits of the industry, at the same time
                            establishing a set of operating and tax conditions which <pb n="744"
                                xml:id="pg_744" facs="0758"/>would be just and fair to the industry.
                            He said that such negotiations were proceeding on an informal basis
                            between him and the representatives of the various companies for some
                            time but that no solution had yet been reached. The concessions under
                            which the companies operate have been obtained over a period of years
                            and on the basis of various petroleum laws. They vary greatly from each
                            other. Royalty and tax rates are not uniform nor are exonerations from
                            import duties on materials needed. Dr. Manrique Pacanins has been
                            endeavoring to secure the agreement of the companies to a new basic
                            petroleum law, and new contracts for the companies, which would
                            establish as far as possible uniform legal and fiscal conditions for all
                            of the companies and for all of the concessions which they hold. In some
                            cases, the new contracts would be less favorable than the old contracts
                            and in some cases, more favorable. Dr. Manrique Pacanins said, however,
                            that the companies, while being extremely affable and full of
                            protestations of a desire to cooperate, continue to insist on taking a
                            legalistic approach rather than a broad approach to the problem. For
                            example, Mr. Lineham [<hi rend="italic">Linam?</hi>], representing the
                            Standard Oil of New Jersey, agreed to suspend court actions on important
                            matters pending the outcome of the negotiations and Dr. Manrique
                            Pacanins had so advised the President.<note n="15" xml:id="d701fn15"
                                >Isaias Medina Angarita.</note> He learned subsequently, however,
                            that the Standard Oil Company had presented an important case to the
                            Supreme Court for decision without mentioning this fact to him.</p>
                        <p>The essential reason why the negotiations have not met with success has
                            been that the companies do not wish to give up any of the so-called
                            rights which they have acquired in the past, particularly under the
                                Gómez<note n="16" xml:id="d701fn16">Juan Vicente Gmez served during
                                the period 19091935 as either President or Chief of Army.</note>
                            regime. Dr. Manrique Pacanins believes that some of the rights the
                            companies enjoyed would not stand a test in the courts—he referred in
                            this instance to one or two cases in which the oil companies had been
                            required to pay large sums of back taxes.… The Government believes that
                            under proper relationships the oil companies can benefit the country
                            greatly, and the country the oil companies, but that a satisfactory
                            agreement can only be worked out in a friendly atmosphere based on a
                            clear understanding of and sympathy for each other’s problems. If the
                            companies do not recognize their social and economic responsibilities
                            and take a broad view of the problem, informal negotiations lead nowhere
                            and then court action is the only alternative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bonsal said that while this is a problem between the Government of
                            Venezuela and the companies, he would be untruthful if he said this
                            Government had no interest in it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Pratt<note n="17" xml:id="d702fn17">Wallace Pratt, vice president,
                                Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.</note> came in at my request. I
                            expressed to him the very great concern with which the Department viewed
                            the current relations between the Government and the oil companies
                            operating in Venezuela. I made it very clear that, of course, the matter
                            was not one in which the Department desired to take an active part so
                            far as specific details are involved.</p>
                        <p>I went over in a general way the history of these relations in the past
                            few years. I pointed out that the majority of the concessions and
                            contracts under which the companies were operating were obtained in the
                            Gómez era. This was a period during which the relationship between
                            government and business in Venezuela failed to develop along the lines
                            followed in other parts of the world. As a result, Venezuelan public
                            opinion since the death of Gómez has been increasingly desirous of
                            placing these relations upon a more modern basis. I said that it seemed
                            to me a great tribute, both to the good sense and tolerance of the
                            Venezuelan people and to the statesmanship of their leaders that the
                            liquidation of the Gómez regime had been accomplished without serious
                            disturbance or upheaval. I concluded, however, that this tolerance and
                            good sense and this statesmanship did not indicate a lack of either
                            desire on the part of the people or determination on the part of their
                            leaders to make certain fundamental changes in certain situations which
                            had been created in the days of Gómez.</p>
                        <p>I then turned specifically to the question of the relations between the
                            oil companies and various officials of the Venezuelan Government during
                            the past two or three years. I did not go into details concerning
                            controversial points.…</p>
                        <p>… I told Mr. Pratt that I was speaking to him at the instruction of the
                            Under Secretary<note n="18" xml:id="d702fn18">Sumner Welles.</note> and
                            that our conversations with Dr. Parra Perez<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d702fn19">Venezuelan Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                            and other officials who visited the United States recently led us to
                            believe that the situation was one calling for prompt and constructive
                            action by the companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pratt expressed some surprise and said that he had not realized the
                            situation was as serious as I had described it. He stated that his
                            company was most anxious to stay in business in Venezuela and that it
                            could only do so by taking into consideration the interests of the
                            Venezuelan Government and people. He said that he would think over what
                            I had told him and that he would probably instruct the <pb n="746"
                                xml:id="pg_746" facs="0760"/>manager in Venezuela (Mr. Linam) to
                            approach President Medina and ascertain his wishes as to the best way in
                            which thorough-going fundamental conversations might be initiated.…</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I emphasized to Mr. Pratt the national interest involved in
                            the maintenance of a flow of oil from Venezuela and said that in my
                            opinion this objective could best be obtained through continued
                            operation by United States companies.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: This letter is for the purpose of
                            introducing to Your Excellency Dr. Gustavo Manrique Pacanins, Attorney
                            General of Venezuela, who in addition to his regular functions, comes
                            before the kind attention of Your Excellency to carry out an important
                            confidential mission that I have believed wise to entrust to his
                            patriotism and qualifications.</p>
                        <p>The mission which I have entrusted to Dr. Manrique Pacanins, and for the
                            happy conclusion of which I count on the generous reception that Your
                            Excellency will give to him, concerns a revision of the petroleum policy
                            followed by Venezuela, a revision which the Government over which I have
                            the honor to preside, is now initiating.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Manrique Pacanins will explain to you, if your Excellency will permit
                            him, the solid basis of justice supporting this plan of my Government, a
                            plan which is shared by the entire Venezuelan nation, and by which,
                            recognizing and respecting at all times the rights legitimately acquired
                            within the scope of our laws, it is proposed to rectify illegitimate,
                            illicit or distressing conditions in order that Venezuela may receive a
                            truly just share in the exploitation of the riches of its sub-soil.</p>
                        <p>It is not the sole purpose of this revision to seek an increase in our
                            petroleum royalties although necessarily this will be one of its
                            consequences: the Government seeks a more stable position for the
                            industry, since the companies having concessions, holding fast to what
                            they defend as their rights—many of which the Government believes are
                            not such—have continued systematically to oppose the Government through
                            passive resistance. The Government has wanted to make them realize that
                            for their own good, a better legal basis should be found for certain
                            situations, by no means clear, that Venezuela is anxious to clarify.
                            This is the revision the Government over <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747"
                                facs="0761"/>which I preside is disposed to bring to a conclusion
                            with the greatest firmness, and although this will be undertaken under
                            the laws of Venezuela and under the general principles of justice and
                            equity, I have not wished to initiate it without first informing Your
                            Excellency, as head of the Government of the great nation whose
                            friendship Venezuela esteems so highly, a friendship which is
                            intensified more every day by the international events uniting us at
                            this moment and making us realize keenly that the future of both of our
                            nations is intimately tied together.</p>
                        <p>In expressing to Your Excellency my personal gratitude for the reception
                            which you may have the kindness to show my confidential envoy, I am
                            particularly pleased to reiterate to you the sincere sentiments of my
                            most cordial friendship and admiration.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Venezuela called to see me this morning, accompanied by
                            Dr. Gustavo Manrique Pacanins, Attorney General of Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador took no part in the conversation and Dr. Pacanins made the
                            following statement:</p>
                        <p>He stated that he had been sent to the United States with a personal
                            letter from the President of Venezuela addressed to the President of the
                            United States which he hoped he would be afforded the opportunity of
                            handing the President. I told him that I would of course be glad to
                            request that these arrangements be made at the White House.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the visit of Dr. Pacanins to Washington and the reason for
                            sending this personal and confidential message to the President of the
                            United States on the part of the President of Venezuela were as follows.
                            The three major oil companies doing business in Venezuela were the
                            Shell, Gulf, and Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. For many years
                            past, the government of President López Contreras and the present
                            government of President Medina have been making every effort to reach an
                            equitable and legal agreement <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0762"
                            />with these companies whereunder the companies would comply with the
                            obligations imposed upon them through the concessions which they had
                            obtained in Venezuela, whereby the grossly unjust concessions and
                            privileges obtained through corruption and fraud by the companies would
                            be abrogated and negotiated on a new, legal and fair basis, and whereby
                            the companies would be willing to enter into new agreements, in certain
                            instances, with the Venezuelan Government as a result of which
                            anachronistic privileges (such as exemption from customs duties for
                            their commissaries) obtained in the earliest days of the concessions,
                            some 30 or more years ago, would be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Pacanins said that all of the efforts of the two Venezuelan
                            governments above referred to had been fruitless. He stated that as a
                            last resort just a year ago he had been sent to New York by the
                            Government of Venezuela to attempt to reach a satisfactory understanding
                            with the companies at their home offices. He stated that he had
                            requested the companies to present him with a project covering what they
                            believed to be fair and reasonable in view of changed conditions and in
                            the light of the facts above set forth. He stated that when this project
                            had been received it had offered nothing except the prospect of
                            interminable negotiations which the Government of Venezuela was
                            unwilling to contemplate.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General stated that before the conclusion of this year of
                            1942 the Government of Venezuela was afforded the opportunity, by the
                            terms of the concession granted the Shell Company, which had been in
                            existence for just 20 years, to terminate the concession or negotiate a
                            new concession. Dr. Pacanins stated that, by the terms of the
                            concession, if the Government of Venezuela did not avail itself of this
                            opportunity this autumn, the existing terms of the concession would
                            continue in effect for another 30 years. He stated that it was therefore
                            imperative for his Government to take this opportunity, and it desired,
                            consequently, at the same time, to eliminate all of its differences with
                            the other two American companies, although only a few of the subsidiary
                            concessions of the American companies expired during the next twelve
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General stated that he was instructed officially to state to
                            this Government that the Government of Venezuela had not the remotest
                            intention of expropriating foreign-owned oil properties in Venezuela. He
                            stated further that the Government of Venezuela desired that the
                            exploitation of Venezuelan oil resources be continued by foreign
                            companies and specifically the companies already doing business in
                            Venezuela. Finally, he stated that the Government of Venezuela would not
                            undertake a single act which was not strictly in <pb n="749"
                                xml:id="pg_749" facs="0763"/>accordance with the precepts of
                            international law and with the laws of Venezuela, and that any action
                            undertaken by the Government of Venezuela to which the companies
                            objected would be submitted to the tribunals of Venezuela for fair and
                            legal adjudication.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I stated that this Government was of course deeply interested in the
                            satisfactory and equitable and legal adjustment of the controversies
                            which had arisen between the American companies and the Government of
                            Venezuela. I said that for a long time past the Department of State had
                            been urging the American companies to negotiate in a friendly and
                            reasonable spirit the adjustment of these difficulties. I stated that,
                            of course, under present conditions, the continued and full supply of
                            oil from the Venezuelan oil fields was a vital necessity for the war
                            effort of the United States and of the nations which are supporting,
                            like Venezuela, the cause of the United Nations. I said anything that
                            would interrupt this essential war service during the period of the war
                            would constitute a grave danger to the Allied Nations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Pacanins interjected to say that that is exactly the view of the
                            Government of Venezuela, and that nothing would be permitted to
                            interfere with the full and orderly operation of the oil properties.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I welcomed the very categoric and satisfactory assurances
                            offered by the Government of Venezuela through Dr. Pacanins, and that,
                            as the Government of Venezuela well knew, this Government would not
                            claim, for American companies doing business in other countries, and in
                            particular in the other American Republics, any undue or illicit
                            privileges or rights, and would certainly condemn any operations on the
                            part of American interests doing business in the other American
                            Republics which constituted participation in bribery or corruption or
                            unlawful procedure. I stated in conclusion that if the Government of
                            Venezuela adopted the policy announced to me, namely strict observance
                            of the tenets of international law, complete compliance with the terms
                            of Venezuelan legislation, submission to the tribunals of any
                            controversies which could not be solved by negotiation, and the
                            determination to encourage the American companies to continue to do
                            business in Venezuela, I felt sure that fair negotiations between the
                            companies and the Government could result in a just and satisfactory
                            settlement. To that end, I said, the Department of State would do
                            whatever it appropriately could to facilitate a friendly adjustment.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: It was a great pleasure
                            to receive from the hands of Dr. Gustavo Manrique Pacanins your letter
                            of August 3 and to hear from Dr. Manrique Pacanins of the views,
                            objectives and plans of your Government with respect to a revision of
                            its relations with the oil companies operating in Venezuela. The fact
                            that you have communicated with me on this subject is a most welcome
                            indication of the degree of mutual confidence and wholehearted
                            friendship existing between our two Governments.</p>
                        <p>All those who have had the privilege of knowing Your Excellency and the
                            purposes and ideals which inspire you and your collaborators are
                            confident that this matter will be handled in a manner wholly adjusted
                            to the highest principles of right and equity. I welcomed the very
                            categoric and satisfactory assurances offered by Dr. Manrique Pacanins.
                            As the Government of Venezuela well knows, this Government will not
                            claim for American companies doing business in other countries any undue
                            or unreasonable privileges or rights and fully recognizes the Venezuelan
                            interest in guiding its economic development in the best interest of its
                            people. Since I understand it to be the policy of your Government to
                            deal fairly with American companies and to give full recognition to
                            their legitimate rights, and is fully aware of the need for maintaining
                            production in the interest of both of our countries, I naturally feel
                            confident that your Government and the companies will shortly find a
                            just and satisfactory settlement of all controversial questions.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency, as well as I, appreciates the importance to our common
                            defense of production and exportation of oil from Venezuela. From this
                            point of view, as well as from the standpoint of general welfare, it is
                            gratifying to note your statement that it is the purpose of your
                            Government to guarantee “the longest and most stable possible future
                            industrial peace, which will be as beneficial to the nation as to the
                            petroleum concessionaires”; and “to avoid and prevent in this manner
                            events which could prejudice these concessionaires in the future, as has
                            happened in other countries”. It seems entirely possible to me to
                            resolve the present problems in a manner which will benefit Venezuelan
                            development and at the same time preserve the rights of the private
                            parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>This expression is in keeping with sound international relations and the
                            principles of the Good Neighbor policy, to which your country and mine
                            have wholeheartedly subscribed.</p>

                        <p>It is apparent that the Venezuelan Government intends to reach a
                            settlement of some kind with the American and British oil companies in
                            the near future. In as much as the Royal Dutch Shell concessions expire
                            in December of this year, according to my information, there is little
                            enough time left for considered negotiation and none at all for
                            unnecessary delays. Our primary interest is that Venezuelan oil remains
                            available for the war. Reduced exports of 200,000 to 300,000 barrels per
                            day have created certain economic problems for Venezuela. Even more
                            serious, however, may be the fact that a reduction to this low level
                            over a considerable period might make it impossible to resume production
                            on short notice at 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day, which might be
                            necessary if we were to lose our sources of supply in the Middle East at
                            a time of high military activity. Consequently it is of the greatest
                            importance that the arrangements made between the Venezuelan Government
                            and the oil companies not only insure uninterrupted supplies from
                            Venezuela at their present level, but also provide for sufficient
                            development work and adequate personnel to enable practically our entire
                            European and African war effort to be supplied from Venezuela on short
                            notice. This, I say, should be this Government’s first concern in the
                            Venezuelan oil situation.</p>
                        <p>I have seen a great deal of Dr. Manrique since he reached this country.
                            He was introduced by a mutual friend, and our frequent meetings have
                            been entirely informal. However, he has talked hours at a stretch about
                            the Venezuelan oil situation. I have not made written reports of these
                            conversations because, actually, the substance of almost everything he
                            has told me was reported by Mr. Welles and Mr. Bonsal after his official
                            conversations with them.</p>
                        <p>Last Sunday, however, he mentioned for the first time a “commission”
                            which, he indicated, is to make a survey of the Venezuelan oil situation
                            and make recommendations to him as to what kind of arrangement should be
                            offered to the oil companies. He explained that this commission is to
                            consist of American experts not connected with any of the oil companies
                            directly concerned, plus two or three Venezuelan oil experts who are
                            intimately familiar with the oil operations there. This commission, he
                            said, is to review the history of oil development in Venezuela with
                            particular reference to the benefits already received by the oil
                            companies and also by Venezuela and then recommend a new basis of
                            division based upon past history, present conditions, and an estimate of
                            the future. These recommendations, according <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752"
                                facs="0766"/>to Manrique, are to be based upon “justice” as closely
                            as “justice” can be determined by impartial and fair-minded men, and
                            without consideration of present legislation or contracts. Manrique’s
                            idea on this point appears to be that if a fair arrangement can be
                            agreed upon, the laws and contracts can easily be changed to accord with
                            it, whereas, in his opinion, it will be impossible to find a sound and
                            lasting solution by matching lawyers’ wits over the technicalities of
                            contracts and existing laws.</p>

                        <p>1078. I had an interview yesterday with President Medina and discussed
                            with him at some length the negotiations which are about to be
                            inaugurated with the oil companies. He told me that Dr. Manrique had
                            returned and brought with him an American technical expert. He stated
                            that it is desired to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the oil
                            companies without lawsuits on [<hi rend="italic">or?</hi>] public
                            furor.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Manrique Pacanins came to the Embassy this morning to tell me of his
                            visit to the United States and to introduce Mr. Arthur Curtice, an
                            American engineer who has been engaged as a technical consultant to aid
                            the Venezuelan Government in discussions with the oil companies. Curtice
                            said he plans to be here 3 months.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Manrique is very optimistic that a satisfactory settlement will be
                            achieved by negotiation. He told me in strictest confidence that his
                            present plans are after about a month’s study of the situation to return
                            to the United States for final discussion there with the heads of the
                            companies concerned.</p>

                        <p>A–212. Following is translation of excerpt dealing with oil industry from
                            President Medina’s address at Maracaibo yesterday.</p>
                        <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0767"/>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“My speech is getting long, but I see in your faces a question which
                                I do not want to leave unanswered: The revision of our petroleum
                                policy as announced by me at the Palacio de Miraflores on that
                                memorable occasion. The National Government, in fulfillment of one
                                of its inevitable duties, firm in its purposes and sure of its
                                action, proposes to obtain a fairer State participation from the
                                exploitation of petroleum, and also that its industrial process be a
                                sure source of work for the Venezuelan laborer. I must observe that
                                this Government, obedient to the Law, endorser of the guarantees
                                which honor our Constitution, watchful of the righteousness of its
                                procedures and not in the least given to hastiness, respects the
                                rights legally acquired, does not consider as adversaries those
                                enterprises which have brought their capital to extend the
                                development of our natural wealth; but, animated by a spirit of
                                right and justice it believes that Venezuela should receive an
                                adequate participation in keeping with its position as owner of that
                                which constitutes the real source of that industry, and that its
                                industrial process should have its principal headquarters in
                                Venezuela in order that the opportunities for the employment of
                                Venezuelan labor may be intensified. The Government does not attack,
                                it tries to convince and is sure that in its purpose there is fair
                                satisfaction for the Nation and a steady and secure equilibrium for
                                industry because agreements are lasting only when they have a basis
                                of equity and justice. I have said that the Government is not given
                                to hastiness and when, from the Presidential Seat I announced the
                                revision of our petroleum policy, it was because I felt sure that we
                                would come to it by one way or the other, by means of conviction and
                                cooperation or by legal means; if, unfortunately, all of the
                                expected results can not be obtained by the first means, then,
                                leaving aside the reasons for equity, the Government, arming itself
                                with incontrovertible juridical and moral power shall proceed, in
                                the name of the Republic, to regain possession of that which
                                corresponds to it by right.</p>
                            <p>From the very same moment that I assumed the Presidency, I became
                                extremely interested in this matter of our petroleum policy, which I
                                consider of the utmost importance to our economic development, and
                                it is my conviction that the year 1942 will see the end of a cycle
                                in the history of our petroleum: the cycle of trial of ignorance and
                                empiricism; today we know what we have and it is a duty of my
                                Government to initiate the first stage of what we might call the era
                                of technical, economical and financial exploitation at the service
                                of the State in cooperation with the enterprises associated with us
                                to transform in effective wealth the potential richness of our
                                subsoil.”</p>

                            point of view is that, since the Venezuelan Government is currently
                            engaged in drafting legislation and in making other arrangements
                            affecting the entire oil industry of Venezuela, it is important that all
                            of the United States oil interests be given an adequate hearing. It
                            seems important that you, as the representative of the United States
                            Government, make sure that such a hearing is, in fact, granted. The
                            Department is, of course, convinced that the Venezuelan Government
                            desires to consider equitably and comprehensively all of the different
                            interests involved, both private and public. Please, therefore, take an
