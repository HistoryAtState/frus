                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102-138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>The editor of this volume, which was compiled in 1992, is convinced that it meets
                    all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection <pb n="IV"
                        xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>and editing. Although this volume records
                    policies and events of more than 30 years ago, the statute of October 28, 1991,
                    allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line in the publication of
                    the series.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 3 years (1961-1963) of the administration of <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName>'s administration. The record of U.S. foreign policy with
                    respect to South Asia from January 1961 through December 1963 comprises one
                    print volume.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations
                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editor believes that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    this statute, although access to some records was restricted, as noted
                    below.</p>
                <p>The editor had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. Certain
                    intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have access
                    to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the
                    National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
                        <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of these
                    agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants, and to material at the
                    National Defense University, particularly the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                        >Maxwell Taylor</persName> Papers and the Lyman Lemnitzer Papers.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided steadily expanding
                    access to Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records still in the custody of that Agency. Department of State historians'
                    access is arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of
                    Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State and <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the procedural
                    and scholarly aspects of the access. The editor determined that the publication
                    of this volume should not be postponed because of the possible discovery of
                    additional important documentation at the Central Intelligence Agency. If such
                    documentation is found by Department of State historians, it will be included in
                    a subsequent <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume.</p>
                <p>The List of Sources, pages XIII-XVIII, lists the particular files and collections

                <p>Principles of Document Selection for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in a
                    microfiche supplement or in bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria
                    in accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards
                    of scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                            Volume XIX</ref></hi></p>
                <p>The volume focuses upon the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    administration's efforts to reorient U.S. policy with respect to South Asia by
                    improving relations <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>with India while
                    maintaining the established alliance relationship with Pakistan. It includes
                    documentation on the impact of the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan,
                    the Indian invasion of Portuguese Goa, and the impact of the Pushtunistan
                    dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It documents U.S. efforts to counter
                    Soviet influence in Afghanistan and India, as well as the attempt to take
                    advantage of the border war between India and China that developed in 1962 in
                    order to forge a closer relationship between the United States and India. In
                    general, the emphasis is on political developments, but documents are included
                    on significant economic concerns, including the use of developmental economic
                    assistance as an important element in the revised policy approach to South Asia.
                    The primary issues, interests, and factors in U.S. policy toward South Asia
                    during this period were often interwoven and affected each other subtly or in
                    clear linkages. The editor determined that a chronological compilation offered a
                    more accurate, comprehensible, and economical presentation of the relevant
                    documentation than a division of the official record according to bilateral
                    relations with particular governments.</p>
                <p>In selecting documents to be included in the volume, the editor gave primary
                    consideration to the formulation of policy within the U.S. Government, with
                    emphasis on the highest level at which policy on a particular subject was
                    determined. The issues involved also generated numerous high-level exchanges
                    with foreign governments, which are documented insofar as possible. Space
                    constraints precluded any attempt at full documentation of internal developments
                    in South Asia, but the editor included a selection of Embassy reportage and
                    intelligence estimates, with emphasis on documents that were seen by high-level
                    policymakers.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> made the major foreign
                    policy decisions during his Presidency, and the editor has attempted to document
                    his role as much as possible. White House and National Security Council staff
                    members played an expanded role in overseeing the traditional national security
                    affairs agencies and providing <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                    with additional information, and that increased role is reflected in this
                    volume, as in others for this period. The Department of State was responsible
                    for the implementation of policy, and Department officials were involved in the
                    genesis of most policy decisions. The documentation selected for the volume
                    reflects that central role.</p>
                <p>The policymaking process under President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                        >Kennedy</persName> was much less structured and formal than that under
                    President Eisenhower, and the documentation differs accordingly. Formal approved
                    policy papers were rare, and internal discussions between <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and his advisers were not always
                    recorded, especially in the early months of 1961. Sometimes the only available
                    record of a Presidential decision is a Department <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII"
                        facs="0008"/>of State telegram transmitting instructions to overseas posts,
                    which states that the instructions represent a decision reached at a White House
                    meeting or by “highest authority.” Insofar as possible, the editor has sought to
                    document such decisions by drawing upon whatever records are available.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for security reasons have been
                    accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of pages not
                    declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material omitted from
                    this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has
                    not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text are so
                    identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>An unnumbered source note to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>has been
                    previously published, and this information has been included in the source
                    footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of

                    the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the
                    contents of individual volumes, it does monitor the overall process and makes

                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, completed in 1994, resulted in
                    the decision to withhold 2.6 percent of the documentation originally selected;
                    12 documents were not declassified. Eleven documents were withheld by the Indian
                    Government and one document relating to intelligence matters was denied. The
                    remaining documents provide an account of the major foreign policy issues
                    confronting and the policies undertaken by the U.S. Government concerning South
                    Asia during this period.</p>

                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information,
                    which was superseded by Executive Order 29528 on April 20, 1995, and applicable

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                    <p>A number of major issues affected U.S. policy toward South Asia during the
                        period 1961-1963. Most of these issues had deep roots and were inherited by
                        the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> administration when it
                        took office in January 1961. Two of the more intractable problems dated back
                        to the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 and the establishment of
                        Pakistan. Among other tensions created with the birth of Pakistan were
                        boundary disputes between Pakistan and India, and also between Pakistan and
                        Afghanistan. The dispute between Pakistan and India was over rival claims to
                        territory in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmir dispute was the
                        most serious of the problems affecting the subcontinent, and had the effect
                        of creating the intermittent threat of armed conflict between India and
                        Pakistan. The dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan was over the Pathan
                        tribal area of Pakistan along the Northwest frontier, referred to by Afghans
                        as Pushtunistan. The United States, which had encouraged Pakistan to become
                        a part of the Western alliance system as a member of both the Central Treaty
                        Organization (<gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>) and the Southeast
                        Asia Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>) during
                        the Eisenhower administration, had sought periodically to foster compromise
                        solutions to these boundary disputes, but to no avail. A third boundary
                        dispute, between India and China in the Ladakh district of Kashmir and along
                        the McMahon Line which marked the boundary between China and India's
                        Northeast Frontier Agency, posed no problems of mixed sympathy for the
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> administration, given the
                        tensions that existed between the United States and the People's Republic of
                        China.</p>
                    <p>U.S. concern to foster solutions to the disputes between Pakistan and its
                        neighbors was magnified by competition between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union for influence in South Asia. Policymakers in Washington were
                        particularly concerned to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence in
                        India, the leading and most populous of the neutral nations. They were also
                        concerned about Soviet influence in Afghanistan, traditionally viewed as the
                        gateway to the subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>Documentation on all of these issues is in Foreign Relations volumes dealing
                        with South Asia for the 1947-1960 period. For material on the major issues

                    </list>
                    <p>Reports from our Ambassador in Karachi during recent months indicate the
                        possibility that in certain quarters in Pakistan there is a trend toward a
                        neutralist position. While President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> and his Government give every evidence of continuing as
                        loyal allies and friends of the United States, there are indications that
                        they may not wish to maintain a defiant attitude toward the U.S.S.R., but
                        that they may wish to reach some sort of an accommodation. To date the
                        principal manifestation of this possible trend is the Pakistan negotiation
                        with the U.S.S.R. for a Soviet oil exploration team which the Pakistanis
                        declined to consider when it was first offered by the Soviets in 1958. The
                        U.S.S.R., for its part, following its propaganda attacks on Pakistan at the
                        time of the U-2 incident, appears to have engaged in a strategic retreat
                        vis-xà-vis Pakistan and has been deliberately friendly in its relations.</p>
                    <p>Our Ambassador in Karachi believes United States-Pakistan relations may have
                        reached a critical stage and that Pakistan policies may be significantly
                        influenced during the next few months by United States statements and
                        actions. He also believes that if the U.S.S.R. brings an oil exploration
                        team to Pakistan, it may enjoy “a major propaganda break-through.”</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador likewise reports a feeling of insecurity among the people of
                        Pakistan in matters pertaining to relations with the West and states that
                        doubts are generated by press reports of possible increases in aid to India
                        which omit reference to Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador reports that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> continues to give assurances that his Government
                        strongly supports collective security and other concepts in harmony with
                        United States policies; that he emphasizes an urgent need for United States
                        declarations making it clear that we attach great importance to nations
                        allied with the West and feels the United States should use the leverage of
                        aid to India to persuade the Indians to pursue “less pro-communist
                        lines.”</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0029"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador therefore believes there is an urgent need for a statement at
                        the earliest practicable date which will reassure our Pakistani allies
                        regarding our attitudes.</p>
                    <p>I believe there is convincing evidence that responsible Pakistanis are
                        considering the desirability of moving toward a more nearly neutral position
                        between the U.S.S.R. and the United States, and that it would be in our
                        interest to include in our public statements evidence that we do not take
                        Pakistan for granted; that we intend to honor our military commitments and
                        continue our aid programs.</p>

                        presented a statement on India's requirements for foreign aid to cover its
                        Third Five-Year Plan beginning April 1, 1961 (Annex A).<note n="1"

                        memorandum proposed: (1) a U.S. commitment in principle to support India's's
                        Third Plan up to a certain ceiling of aid, (2) a substantial amount of
                        “free” or “non project” aid, (3) “untied” aid and (4) that India, on a
                        population basis and for compelling political reasons, had a good case for
                        receiving “substantially more than one-third” of total American aid.</p>
                    <p>Following his perusal of Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s document Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked that, as Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> was well aware, current United States laws
                        and regulations made it difficult to accede at this time to some of the
                        proposals advanced in the memorandum. He commented on particular points as
                        follows: <list>
                            <item>(1) <hi rend="italic">Long-Term Commitment</hi>. The problem of a
                                long-term commitment in support of the development programs of
                                various countries was currently under consideration by the
                                Administration. He could not predict the final results of this study
                                but could assure Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> of the
                                Administration's sympathetic interest in supporting India's
                                development.</item>
                            <item>(2) <hi rend="italic">Tied Loans</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he personally hoped
                                that the United States might be able eventually to move away from
                                the present strict position on U.S. procurement. In view of the
                                current balance of payments position, however, he doubted that there
                                was any immediate prospect of our being able to depart from this
                                policy. The issue, he said, was tied up with a resolution of basic
                                long-term problems of capital movements.</item>
                            <item>(3) <hi rend="italic">Amounts of Assistance</hi>. Here again, Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that the
                                Administration had under study the over-all problem of volume and
                                type of aid which it might be able to provide on a global basis. As
                                Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> was aware, the U.S. was subject to
                                ever-widening demands on its resources.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that his government was faced with three
                        main problems with respect to the financing of its Third Plan: <list>
                            <item>First, he said, was the volume of aid and in this context he
                                reviewed briefly the history of the efforts of the creditor or
                                consortium countries to assist India. Unfortunately, he said, these
                                countries had not been able to make available the full amount of
                                $1,050 million in aid which had been indicated over the last few
                                years. With the greater expenditures contemplated over the Third
                                Plan the Government of India will need even greater foreign
                                assistance than in the past if its Plans are to prove
                                successful.</item>
                            <item>Secondly, it was most important that India obtain, to the extent
                                possible, advance commitments of aid in order that the Plan projects
                                might go forward without hindrance. He knew it would be difficult
                                under present U.S. legislation, but hoped it might be possible for
                                the United States to make a general commitment of support up to a
                                certain amount, to be followed <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0031"
                                />by annual appropriations and with the money to be disbursed as
                                required.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>A third problem concerned the organization of aid to India. The International
                        Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he said, intended to invite all of
                        the capital exporting countries to participate in the next meeting of the
                            “<gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> India Club” now expected to convene
                        in April in London. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that if this meeting
                        were to prove successful in producing firm commitments of substantial aid it
                        was important that the United States begin conversations now to urge on the
                        European participants the importance of their coming to that meeting
                        prepared to make firm commitments. In this connection, he presented a table
                        of a proposed apportionment of aid to India among the contributing countries
                        (Annex B).</p>
                    <p>Asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> whether the figure
                        of $500 million included in the Indian table as the amount of aid to be
                        obtained from the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> had, in fact, been discussed with Bank
                        officials, Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that it had. He remarked that
                        both institutions and, in particular, the <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                            >IDA</gloss>, should be able to make a more substantial contribution.
                        Noting that the Soviets had already promised $500 million in support of the
                        Third Plan, he said that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> expected
                        that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would contribute an
                        additional two sums of $150 million each. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> thanked Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> for the
                        table.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sugar Quota for India</hi></p>
                    <p>Remarking that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CMAC1">Chagla</persName> had
                        already made a representation on the matter to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> urged
                        that favorable consideration be given to the Indian request for a sugar
                        quota of 500,000 tons in the U.S. market. This request, he said, was closely
                        tied in with the external financing of India's Third Plan. If granted, it
                        would enable India to earn very substantial additional funds through
                        commercial exports. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        explained that the question of U.S. imports of sugar was currently before
                        the Congress and that we had no way of forecasting what action the Congress
                        might take; however, we would certainly keep the Indian request in mind. Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> expressed his appreciation of the legislative
                        aspect and stated that the purpose of his representation was to urge
                        favorable consideration in any recommendations the Department might forward
                        to Congress. He asked if there was any possibility that India might be
                        granted a temporary allocation under existing legislation. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that it was his understanding
                        that, under the law, the present quota countries stood first in line, and
                        that only if these countries were unable to supply all of their entitlement
                        could other countries be considered. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        concluded this point by asserting that it would help India enormously if it
                        could obtain an export market for this very important industry.</p>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0032"/>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Barter of Ferromanganese</hi></p>
                    <p>As a last point Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> inquired if it would be
                        possible to negotiate a barter agreement wherein India would provide the
                        United States with ferromanganese in return for agricultural commodities
                        which would be re-exported by India to third countries in exchange for other
                        commodities required by India. Commenting that he did not know if this would
                        be possible, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he
                        would investigate the matter.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> could expect him “to be something of a
                        nuisance.” India, he said, was a huge country and its problems and needs
                        were great. He hoped that the United States would be able to continue the
                        assistance which it had so generously offered in the past. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he would be glad to
                        receive Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> at any time and that we intended to
                        be of all possible assistance within the limits of our capabilities and our
                        world-wide commitments.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Tom</hi>: My colleagues and I have read with
                        interest your paper entitled “Another Look at the Kashmir Problem,” which
                        was sent with your transmittal slip of January 5, 1961.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d4fn1">The summary and conclusions portion of this paper, which
                            was prepared by the Policy Planning Staff on November 18, 1960, is
                            printed in <ref target="frus1958-60v15#pg_214"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations</hi>, 1958-1960, vol. XV, p. 214</ref>. The complete
                            paper is in Department of State, S/P Files: Lot 67 D 548,
                        India.</note></p>
                    <p>I find the paper in general a good outline of the problem, and am in general
                        agreement with most of its contents. I am inclined to believe, however, that
                        the general tone of the paper reflects a bit more optimism that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName> will
                        succeed in finding a solution to the problem than events, particularly of
                        the recent past, would support. Certainly the Pakistanis have become
                        extremely disillusioned and believe even more strongly than before that some
                        pressure will have to be applied on the Indians before they will move from
                        their present adamant position. Yet the Pakistanis, and particularly
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, have often voiced the
                        themes appearing in the paper that “progress toward a solution is apt to be
                            <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0033"/>directly dependent upon <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName>,” and
                        “it will be more difficult to achieve a solution at a later date when
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> have passed from the scene.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has long felt that only a strong
                        leader in Pakistan such as himself, and a strong leader in India such as
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, can hope to solve the problem by peaceful
                        means pursuant to arrangements which could be rendered acceptable to their
                        respective publics.</p>
                    <p>As you know, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, as well
                        as most Pakistanis, believes that the United States has not used to the
                        extent that it should its appreciable potential influence upon
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to move toward a settlement of the Kashmir
                        problem. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and his cabinet fully
                        understand the reasons for massive American aid to India and, although this
                        has not always been the case, it is true now at least that they recognize
                        that such aid to India is in fact in Pakistan's interest, as well as in the
                        interest of the entire free world. Their main concern is that we have not
                        used <persName>Nehru</persName>'s imperative need for American assistance as
                        an instrument to persuade him to be reasonable on the Kashmir problem, a
                        solution to which is considered to be essential for the stability of and
                        real progress in the area.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the general improvement of Pakistan-Indian relations which has
                        taken place under <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s regime,
                        there have been two significant developments which have led us to hope that
                        a solution to Kashmir is not impossible. One is the fact that the Pakistanis
                        cautiously state that the plebiscite called for by the United Nations (which
                        they seem to recognize India will never accept) is not the only means by
                        which the problem can be solved, and they have indicated a willingness to
                        discuss some sort of partition. The other is the fact that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> disclosed a willingness in his last meeting
                        with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> at least to discuss
                        Kashmir, implying some basis other than India's claims to the entire
                        area.</p>
                    <p>In light of this situation, I have some reservations about the statement in
                        the paper that “for friends of India and Pakistan to intervene at this time
                        with proposals for a solution would undoubtedly be counterproductive.” As
                        indicated above, this is not true in the case of Pakistan. In fact, the
                        opposite is more nearly the case. The lack of American efforts to help find
                        a solution is a continuing and major source of Pakistani disillusionment and
                        dissatisfaction with us.</p>
                    <p>I realize that any approach to <persName>Nehru</persName> must be extremely
                        cautious and couched in such terms as to avoid a reversal of the present
                        excellent trend in Indo-American relations. Yet it seems to me that the
                        expanded aid program to India and Pakistan, which appears likely, could
                        provide an atmosphere and context conducive to some initiative on our part.
                        Conversely, increased aid to India unrelated to Indo-Pakistan relations
                        might drive Pakistan further away from us and confirm the already widespread
                        conviction that Pakistan should also have the best of both worlds.</p>
                    <p>It is easy enough for me in Pakistan to make suggestions as to what we should
                        do in India. Obviously, I am in no position accurately to evaluate <pb n="8"
                            xml:id="pg_8" facs="0034"/>the situation there and the prospects of any
                        particular course of action vis-a-vis <persName>Nehru</persName>. Yet it
                        does seem to me clear that, on the one hand, the tremendous advantages to be
                        gained by some progress on Kashmir and, on the other hand, the dangers of
                        increased and serious problems if no progress is made, render it advisable
                        for us not to come to any firm conclusion that we should take no initiative
                        at this time. I believe we should take some initiative, but the precise
                        nature of it would have to be very carefully considered. Perhaps the recent
                        assumption of power by the new United States administration which the
                        Indians regard as very friendly towards them would provide an opportunity
                        for some sort of review of the situation with <persName>Nehru</persName> for
                        the purpose of urging him to advance discussions with Pakistan designed to
                        settle the issue on a compromise basis.</p>

                    <p>1374. Presidential Handling. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>, who was in Karachi briefly en route to Dacca,
                        telephoned last evening and asked me come to his house. Finance Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> and Minister Fuel, Power
                        and Water Resources <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> were with
                        him (<persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is accompanying President
                        to East Pakistan).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he was thinking about asking
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> during his forthcoming
                        visit in Washington to deliver personal letter to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, and he wished talk about it
                        informally with me and obtain my reaction. Letter would offer have <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> outline some of <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s thinking on US-Pakistan relations
                        and his ideas concerning certain aspects of US policy. His purpose was to be
                        helpful. He was convinced that if President <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9"
                            facs="0035"/><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> understood
                        attitudes Pakistan and other Asian countries, particularly members of
                        security alliances, he would be able to act appropriately to reverse present
                        trend by which number of America's friends had begun to lose heart.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> showed me text of
                        letter which he proposed send and asked whether I thought President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would like to receive it
                        and to have <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> elaborate his
                        views. I responded I am confident President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> would be happy to have President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s views and, although I could not of
                        course know whether it would be possible for him to do so, I had no doubt he
                        would be willing to see <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> if his
                        schedule permitted. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> asked me to
                        seek appointment and our conversation then turned to substance of <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s concern re US-Pakistani
                        relations.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> reiterated that basic policy of
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> is predicated on belief that
                        Pakistan's destiny lies in friendship with US. He had no doubt that US would
                        continue to attach importance to this relationship on basis of alliance, and
                        that there would be no shift in US policy inimical to Pakistan's interest.
                        Nevertheless, he was frankly concerned that in pre-election speeches as well
                        as in statements following assumption of office, administration leaders had
                        on several occasions made warm statements concerning India and other
                        neutrals and had not made such statements about Pakistan and other allies,
                        except <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He said this had had
                        disturbing effect not only in Pakistan but also in Iran, Thailand,
                        Philippines and other countries. Also disturbing to United States Allies had
                        been statements by President Eisenhower (to African representatives) as well
                        as by new administration officials which gave impression that US welcomed
                        neutralism. This connection, in responding to my comments context in which
                        statements [made,] <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he could
                        well understand that US must say in effect that it did not insist upon
                        countries joining security pacts against their wishes and that it desired
                        them remain neutral if that was what they wanted, but impression
                        unfortunately had been given that US actually encouraged neutralism and
                        looked with greater favor upon neutralists than upon allies.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> also made a point that he felt US
                        friends, particularly in Asia, had been greatly weakened by extremely soft
                        and almost frightened reaction of US Government to Khrushchev's bellicose
                        threats at time of summit breakdown. When I explained again reasons for
                        great restraint on part of US in responding to Soviet threats and
                        bellicosity, President said while he understood this many Asians had not,
                        and that this had weakened not only US but United States friends in Asia.
                        “You cannot imagine how much this hurt us.” He said US position in Asia
                        should require firmness and courage, if US expected firmness and courage on
                        part of anti Communist leaders.</p>
                    <p>In the course of this lengthy discussion it was recognized that present
                        public speculation in Pakistan on course of Pakistani policies was <pb
                            n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0036"/>due in part to concatenation of
                        several circumstances, particularly (A) fear which President felt was
                        unfounded, that attitude of newly installed US administration toward
                        Pakistan would represent change and that Pakistan might be left in exposed
                        position vis-a-vis Communist bloc, and (B) erroneous assumption that Soviet
                        oil negotiations had implications going beyond actual purposes of <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. President felt that as facts became clear
                        and doubts removed, Pakistan public would be reassured. He reiterated
                        several times what he has told me from the outset of negotiations with
                        Soviets, i.e. that US had nothing to fear from this matter which he said was
                        “relatively unimportant” and largely an effort on part of <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to soften Soviets in their hostile attitude
                        toward Pakistan particularly in connection with such questions as Kashmir
                        and “Pushtunistan.”</p>
                    <p>I sensed that President was somewhat in doubt as to whether he should give me
                        a copy of the letter, since he assumed I would telegraph it in advance of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName>'s visit. It was obvious
                        that he attached great importance to the original being delivered to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> by <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName>, so that latter would have
                        opportunity to elaborate.</p>

                        reassured at this time of our intention to continue to work with Pakistan as
                        an ally, and encourage him to maintain his very strong pro-western and
                        pro-American policies in context of collective security.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="italic">Begin Text.</hi></p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>We in Pakistan are very happy on your election and on the excellent choice of
                        your advisers. The wisdom and insight with which you are examining the
                        problems of the world and the conviction with which you are giving
                        expression to your views, give rise to the expectation that the Government
                        of the United States of America will follow firm policies with courage and
                        vigour. This is a heartening change for friends like us of America.</p>
                    <p>In the under-developed regions of the world today, two major forces are
                        operating. The first is the force of communism with its fixed and
                        unshakeable aim of world conquest and domination through whatever means
                        might be considered effective in any given set of circumstances—subversion,
                        instigation or aggression. the second is the growing feeling of resentment
                        against the colonial powers. Somehow or other, this feeling has come to be
                        crystalized as against The West. Of the Western Powers, their leader,
                        namely, the United States of America is made the special target of
                        antagonism. I may describe this second major force as anti-westernism and
                        anti-Americanism.</p>
                    <p>The reaction to the spread of communism is different in different countries.
                        In some, as in Pakistan, the government and the people are determined to
                        keep this Godless creed out at all costs. We also fully believe that our
                        destiny lies in friendship with the United States. It is therefore in the
                        supreme interest of the West that this determination should be sustained. It
                        cannot, however, be sustained fully if the attitude and policies in the West
                        itself are calculated to undermine it or even create a sense of doubt in the
                        minds of firm friends.</p>
                    <p>I have asked my Finance Minister, <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mohammed
                            Shoaib</persName>, who is visiting Washington in connection with a
                        meeting of the World Bank, to deliver this letter personally to you. In case
                        you would like to discuss the matter I have referred to in this letter, I am
                        sure <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Mohammed Shoaib</persName> would be very
                        happy to elucidate the point further.</p>
                    <p>With best wishes and very kind regards.</p>

                    <p>G-40. Following is text of letter I personally delivered Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> February 21 setting forth
                        current U.S. position on economic development aid to Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>“American Embassy, Kabul, February 21, 1961.</p>
                    <p>“Your Royal Highness:</p>
                    <p>“During my recent visit to the United States, I took the opportunity to
                        discuss with top officials of our new Administration the desire and plans of
                        Afghanistan for economic and social development. During the course of my
                        consultations, we reviewed the whole background and the pattern of American
                        efforts to assist Afghanistan in carrying out its plans for development.</p>
                    <p>“At the outset, I should like you to know that I found great interest in and
                        understanding of Afghanistan at high levels of the new Administration. On
                        the basis of the Administration's review of the current world situation, I
                        can assure you that it is the continuing desire and intention of the United
                        States Government to assist Afghanistan in concrete, practical ways in its
                        own development efforts.</p>
                    <p>“I know that Your Royal Highness' Government is now engaged in the
                        complicated process of defining its goals and laying its plans for the years
                        ahead in the light of the progress achieved in the years just past. With
                        this in mind, it seemed to me that it might be timely and useful to examine
                        in some detail the role of the United States in assisting in the economic
                        and social development of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>“As you know, American assistance to Afghanistan began in 1949 when the
                        Export-Import Bank made a loan of $21,000,000 for Helmand Valley
                        development. Technical assistance began in 1952 with a small grant for an
                        education program. From these beginnings, American assistance has grown over
                        the succeeding ten years until, by June 30, 1960, approximately $162 million
                        had been committed, including $23 million of wheat. During the current
                        fiscal year, an additional $20 million has been committed, including $7
                        million of wheat, bringing the total to $182 million. Of this amount $51.7
                        million has been provided as loans while the bulk, or $130.3 million, has
                        been in the form of grants.</p>
                    <p>“Equally important was the expansion of American assistance into wider
                        fields. Whereas during the first five years aid was concentrated in the
                        Helmand Valley project and technical assistance in the field of education,
                        the succeeding years saw an expansion to include large-scale development <pb
                            n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0039"/>assistance for the construction of
                        roads, airports and educational buildings, as well as increased technical
                        assistance in the fields of civil aviation, mining, agriculture and public
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>“At present, all of these programs and projects are progressing. The landing
                        field at Kandahar International Airport is in operation; Herat airfield is
                        in an advanced stage of construction; paving is proceeding on the Torkham
                        road and is about to begin on the Spin Baldak road while invitations to
                        construction contractors to bid on the Kabul-Kandahar road will be issued
                        about March 15 under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers. The new
                        buildings for Kabul University are under construction.</p>
                    <p>“That is the situation at present. In considering the future, account should
                        first be taken of the fact that all of these development projects and
                        technical assistance programs will be carried forward into the period of the
                        Second Five-Year Plan now being drawn up by Your Royal Highness' Government.
                        In the course of the review undertaken in Washington during my
                        consultations, a careful estimate was made of the probable future costs,
                        during the next five years, of completing certain projects and continuing
                        existing programs throughout the period of the next Five-Year Plan. It was
                        calculated that this will require approximately $85 million in new funds
                        during American fiscal years 1962 through 1966. In fact, taking into
                        consideration the accelerating pace of our construction projects, our own
                        provisional estimates, not as yet legislatively authorized, is that an
                        additional obligation of some $30 million could be effectively used during
                        our Fiscal Year 1962. I believe it safe for you to assume that continued aid
                        is clearly implied by these estimates, subject of course to Congressional
                        appropriations. Furthermore, in anticipation of completion of the draft
                        Second Five-Year Plan, our technicians have been working with officials of
                        the appropriate Ministries to identify and estimate requirements for U.S.
                        assistance in certain fields, notably education, agriculture, public
                        administration and specialized training abroad.</p>
                    <p>“In the specific field of education, the United States has made an
                        exceptional arrangement, unparalleled anywhere else in the world, whereby
                        Your Highness' Government has been assured that up to a specific sum (a
                        little less than $17,000,000) can be made available, subject of course to
                        Congressional appropriations, over the next five years for development and
                        technical assistance in the field of education. This has been made possible
                        by a special decision, approved at the highest level, in the hope that it
                        would facilitate sound forward planning of development in this complex
                        field, particularly at this time, when Your Highness' Government is
                        preparing its plans for the next five years. We have been able to make this
                        special arrangement in the field of education because of our long experience
                        in this field in Afghanistan, our knowledge of your plans and the
                        well-defined limits of the field, combined with the benefit of United States
                        sponsored specialized studies of Kabul <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0040"
                        />University and of the development of primary and elementary education.</p>
                    <p>“I had the opportunity while in Washington to make known Your Government's
                        desire for a long term commitment to assist in the development of Your
                        country under its Second Five-Year Plan to all the top officials in the new
                        Administration who have responsibility in matters pertaining to foreign
                        assistance. I found these officials greatly interested in being fully
                        informed of this problem since they are now engaged in a searching review of
                        our world-wide assistance program with a view to determining how legislation
                        and procedures might be improved.</p>
                    <p>“The general desirability of longer term commitments is recognized and the
                        possibilities of obtaining the necessary legislative authority are being
                        carefully analyzed. This is a complex matter involving the legal
                        distribution of authority between various branches of our Government. The
                        outcome of these studies will naturally take some time. In the meantime the
                        new Administration had to conclude that it was not in a position to make
                        such long term commitments to any particular nation at the present time. Our
                        inability to make such a decision at the present time of course in no way
                        alters our desire to continue to assist your country to the limit of our
                        ability, taking into consideration the total resources available to us for
                        assistance to nations around the world in the development of their countries
                        and improvement of the standard of living of their people.</p>
                    <p>“Furthermore, you may assume that my Government reaffirms its willingness to
                        consider new projects, including design and feasibility studies therefor,
                        submitted through normal aid channels for consideration by <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>, and
                        other institutions. We remain as well willing to consider future requests
                        for agricultural commodities to provide such supplies to your people and to
                        assist in your efforts to raise local currency for further development. For
                        the immediate future, I am authorized to inform you that we would consider
                        without delay a request from Your Government for an additional 50 thousand
                        tons of wheat under the same arrangements as concluded with Your Government
                        on November 16, 1960.</p>
                    <p>“I am further authorized to inform you that we are prepared to furnish on a
                        top priority basis the services of an economic advisory team to Your
                        Government to work with Your Ministry of Planning in conducting reviews, not
                        binding on either of our Governments, of development projects, resources,
                        implications of development activities already going on, and feasible
                        methods as to further future development. This is a normal approach which
                        has been accepted by other countries to help provide the technical basis for
                        decisions as to the future direction and extent of foreign assistance. You
                        may be assured that such an advisory team would come to your country on a
                        continuing basis, and with an open mind prepared to arrive at independent
                        conclusions concerning levels and <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0041"
                        />types of development, taking into consideration the availability of Afghan
                        manpower and natural resources, and other economic considerations. The
                        advisory team would be from a non-governmental institution and technical
                        recommendations that they would make would not be under U.S. Government
                        supervision or influence. I shall eagerly await word as to whether such a
                        group of advisors is desired by Your Government.</p>
                    <p>“I am also authorized to inform you that my Government can make available an
                        additional amount of $10 million for irrigation, drainage and other land and
                        water development within the Helmand Valley. This amount will be obligated
                        in segments over the next several years, and the first segment will be
                        available for expenditure as soon as plans for its most effective
                        utilization can be finalized with the assistance of our Bureau of
                        Reclamation team now working in the Valley. It is my understanding that
                        considerable progress has already been made in the development of such plans
                        and we on our part hope that these plans will be finalized as quickly as
                        possible through mutual agreement as to the best possible expenditure of
                        these funds.</p>
                    <p>“While in Washington I was also able to secure approval on a previous request
                        of Your Government that U.S. assistance be furnished to help in the
                        establishment of a cartographic institute. Likewise the request of Your
                        Government for assistance in establishing a film laboratory for the
                        processing of film within Afghanistan was also approved. Appropriate
                        officials from the Embassy, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> are prepared to discuss these
                        matters in detail with appropriate members of Your Government.</p>
                    <p>“In addition, I am authorized to negotiate a $500,000 Educational Exchange
                        (Fulbright) Agreement immediately, details of which I am submitting to Your
                        Royal Highness separately.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, I should like to convey to Your Highness the sense of encouragement
                        which I experienced in recently observing, at first hand, the intense
                        efforts being made by the new Administration to make our world-wide
                        assistance programs as effective as humanly possible with a view to
                        advancing the world a little closer to the goals of peace, progress and
                        freedom which remain a dedicated objective of my Government.</p>
                    <p>“Accept, Your Royal Highness, the renewed assurances of my highest
                            consideration.”<note n="1" xml:id="d7fn1">In telegram 789 from Kabul,

                    </list>
                    <p>The President opened the conversation by expressing the opinion that finance
                        ministers had the most difficult of all jobs in any government.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said that he was honored to be
                        received by the President and then handed the President a letter from
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub Khan</persName>.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d8fn1">See <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> The
                        President read this and then said it was a “fine letter.” So many
                        communications between Heads of States consisted only of generalities. This
                        letter had substance. He asked when <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> was departing Washington and when told that he would
                        depart March 11 the President said that he would give <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> a reply to take back with him.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of the conversation consisted principally of the President very
                        skillfully drawing out the views of <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> on a variety of subjects. The President twice made
                        the point that Pakistan was the friend and ally of the United States in
                        “good times and bad.” He said the U.S. valued Pakistan's friendship and its
                        stalwart posture in international problems.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Colonialism</hi></p>
                    <p>The President remarked that it was curious that the United States, which had
                        never held any territory in Africa, should be grouped with the colonial
                        powers. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> replied that he was
                        afraid that this was the inevitable result of world leadership: it was the
                        price the United States paid for its preeminent position. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said that the anti-colonialist theme
                        had a deeper appeal to the people of Africa and the Middle East than did
                        anti-communism. The truth was that in many of these countries the <pb n="17"
                            xml:id="pg_17" facs="0043"/>people had had no experience with communism
                        but they had had experience with colonialism. He said in the Middle East the
                        strongest appearance of communism had been in Syria but Nasser had stepped
                        in and redressed the situation. The President said that there had been
                        communism also in Iraq. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said
                        that Iraq was tremendously isolated and did not have much influence but
                        Nasser's influence was all-pervading. There was a tendency in the Near East
                        and in Africa to believe that Nasser is leading an anti-colonialist
                        campaign: anti-colonialism becomes anti-West as a result of the French,
                        Belgian and Portuguese presence in Africa. Because these countries are the
                        allies of the U.S., the U.S. unfortunately is considered to be in the same
                        category.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi></p>
                    <p>The President asked about Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> replied that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> felt that Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> had accepted too much aid of all kinds
                        from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to pull back. <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> feared that Afghanistan had “passed the
                        point of return”. It did not believe that King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Zahir</persName> wanted this: <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName> was responsible. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> said that relations between the <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        were tense but “of course there is no military problem.” He told how a
                        tribal army coming from Afghanistan had been routed by the tribesmen on the
                        Pakistan side. (Note: he did not mention Khrushchev's support for the
                        Pushtunistan theory.)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Iran</hi></p>
                    <p>The President said: “What about Iran?” <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> replied that Iran was the subject of constant concern
                        on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> stopped there whenever he travelled in
                        order to talk to the <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName>. He said
                        that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was convinced that the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> was solidly pro-West. The
                        country had, however, mismanaged its very considerable resources. The people
                        had looked poorer to him the last time he had been there. The elections in
                        Iran had not gone very well and the country was subjected to vitriolic radio
                        attacks from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> had a large body of ideas regarding
                        his army and at one time had suggested he might become the Supreme Commander
                        of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> repeated that he did not believe that Iran would turn
                        neutralist.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Laos</hi></p>
                    <p>The President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> had
                        any ideas with regard to Laos. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName>
                        replied that he did not feel competent to talk on this complicated
                        subject.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Aid Program</hi></p>
                    <p>The President said that the administration was going to have difficulties
                        with the Congress in getting through its aid program. It was difficult to go
                        before the Congress year after year seeking money for foreign <pb n="18"
                            xml:id="pg_18" facs="0044"/>aid. The Congress had in mind “bad
                        experiences” with foreign aid such as the $300,000,000 spent in Laos.
                        However, the administration was going to fight hard.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Oil Prospecting Agreement with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss></hi></p>
                    <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> about the
                        $30,000,000 agreement recently reached between the <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for oil
                        prospecting. He said he understood that American oil companies had
                        prospected for oil in Pakistan but were thought not to have done a good
                        job—not to have looked very hard. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> said that this impression did not exist among
                        Pakistanis who knew the real situation. Eight or nine foreign companies had
                        spent between seventy and eighty million dollars prospecting for oil in
                        Pakistan. Unfortunately, they had only found gas. Over three years ago the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had suggested that it could find
                        oil in Pakistan and would like to try. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> considered long and carefully and finally decided to let
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> work in the area not given as
                        concessions to foreign companies. This was the result of a “change of
                        attitude” towards the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> on the part of the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: earlier the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had insisted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, if it wished to be helped by the Soviets,
                        should withdraw from its alliances—now the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> said keep your alliances, we will help you anyway.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said that in negotiating
                        the agreement a very interesting fact had emerged. The Soviets had said that
                        they had three rates of interest. For communist countries the interest was
                        2%; for neutralist countries the rate of interest was 2-1/2% and for Western
                        committed countries the rate was 4%. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        replied that if the interest was to be 4% the deal was off whereupon the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> quickly agreed to 2-1/2% interest
                        on the $30,000,000 credit of which $25,000,000, approximately, would be in
                        the form of drilling machinery and associated equipment. Only about
                        $5,000,000 would be for technical assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that if the Russians did find oil this would cause

                    <p>The President asked how relations with India were going. <persName

                        Indus Waters Agreement, relations had not been improving. The outstanding
                        question between the two countries was Kashmir. When
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had visited Karachi last fall <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had had a number of talks with him
                        suggesting that a solution to the Kashmir problem should be found which
                        would take account of the interests of the three parties: the Kashmiris, the
                        Indians and the Pakistanis. <persName>Nehru</persName> had not followed up
                        on this. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> had spent two hours
                        with him not long ago in Delhi and <persName>Nehru</persName> had not raised
                        the subject. Every Pakistani in every walk of life felt very deeply about
                        Kashmir. There could be no <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0045"/>really
                        close relations between the two countries until Kashmir was settled. (Note:
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> did not make the point that
                        the United States should bring pressure on India to achieve a

                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> replied that he did not
                        know. The ChiComs had recently made overtures to the <gloss target="#t_GOP1"

                        ChiComs had in mind but they gathered that they were prepared to reach a
                        settlement, if only to bring pressure on India (he laughed). He said that
                        the ChiComs would say that they were able to reach an agreement on their
                        border with Burma, Nepal, and Pakistan and that the Indians were at fault in
                        not agreeing also.</p>

                            >Shoaib</persName> told the President that one reason why there had been
                        a deterioration was the communal killings which had recently taken place in
                        India. Resentment against this ran high in Pakistan and there had been some
                        student rioting in Karachi. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName>
                        said that according to “Dawn” about 1000 Moslems had died in India.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JGLJ1">Lewis Jones</persName> quoted the Embassy
                        in Delhi as having estimated the actual number of deaths in the neighborhood
                        of 100 or 200 to which <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> did not
                        demur. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said that India and
                        Pakistan both have approximately 11% minorities from the point of view of
                        religion—Moslems in India and Hindus in Pakistan. However, the population of
                        India being so much greater the actual number of Moslems is much greater and
                        the concern felt for their welfare in Pakistan is understandable. <persName

                        whole family had been burned to death by the Hindus. He then told the story
                        of his rescuing a Moslem <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0046"/>family from
                        a Hindu mob some years ago. (Note: It was interesting to see both <persName

                    <p>The President accompanied his visitors to the door of the office and said

                            >Daud</persName> made righting this “wrong” a foremost policy of his

                        Pakistan. US refrained from taking sides publicly in hope being effective
                        bringing two sides together. Our efforts have been futile for many reasons
                        among which are: 1. Deliberate vagueness of Afghan position which makes it
                        difficult understand what they really want; and 2. Pakistan's persistent
                        efforts pretend no problem exists which makes serious discussion extremely
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> came to power he apparently
                        decided that handling <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> with kid gloves on
                        this problem unwise. All evidence seems to indicate he has felt that blunt
                        soldier-like approach was in best interests Pakistani.</p>
                    <p>He took lead in publicly calling Pushtunistan issue a “stunt” and otherwise
                        showed condescending attitude towards Royal family and Afghan. He has
                        justified his approach by saying he believed tough approach would drive
                        Afghan to its knees and then it would come crawling to West. We have not
                        agreed his approach but have been unable convince him otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Afghan position has correspondingly hardened, and preoccupation with this
                        issue has become paramount over all others recently, including development,
                        the other keystone to <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>'s policy.
                        It led him into abortive attempt to retain influence in tribal areas of
                        Pakistan last fall when he sent large group of tribesmen across Durand Line.
                        These were slaughtered in ambush by Pakistanis, resulting in great loss of
                        face for <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> and serious challenge
                        to him personally to remain head of government. <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> followed up quickly to take advantage of situation and
                        extend its control by stationing political agents and para-military
                        personnel throughout area to bring it for first time under effective control
                        by any government. Winter came and activities largely ceased due to
                        inaccessibility.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0048"/>
                    <p>This consolidation of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> control is direct
                        challenge to <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>'s avowed Pushtunistan
                        policy and recognized as such by the government. Our estimate is that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> see no course other than to bow in
                        defeat or take some action on their own to recoup their position. We believe
                        they will choose latter, even though aware that it may lead to the end of
                        Afghanistan as independent country and end of Royal family itself. While
                        this may appear irrational and suicidal in American eyes, it is not entirely
                        unprecedented reaction in Moslem Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName>'s present illness, if anything, may well encourage
                        rather than retard this type of thinking.</p>
                    <p>For the present, Afghan agents are doing what they can to stir up trouble
                        across border. The fact that the area [<hi rend="italic">they are?</hi>]
                        apparently as successful as they are leads us to conviction that there is
                        considerable local resentment among tribes across border against Pakistanis
                        for taking over area. Pakistanis have taken dramatic counter-measures
                        including use of modern aircraft which would certainly seem to increase
                        emotions and tensions. Our efforts to urge restraint upon part of Pakistanis
                        not very effective as they take position we know little about tribal area
                        and our advice therefore not very pertinent.</p>
                    <p>We believe the <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> will probably push
                        situation to stage of guerrilla warfare as means of showing action on their
                        part in support of tribes and in hopes of attracting enough attention to
                        begin internationalization of dispute by introduction into <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This is certainly highly dangerous as
                        Pakistanis seem likely to react militarily, quickly and with vigor. Our view
                        is that <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> probably no longer has
                        strength to weather such a chain of events, at least as Prime Minister. Only
                        apparent successors, <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Ali Mohammed</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>, are probably not of
                        sufficient strength to hold government together. Successors in Royal Family
                        with capability are in much younger age bracket and without popular support.
                        Opposition groups in process formation are as yet unequipped to take over
                        government without apparent period of chaos. One can visualize segments of
                        Pakistani opinion who would be gratified by downfall of Royal Family as
                        worthwhile end in itself, but we can not share their sanguinity without some
                        certainty as to what is to follow.</p>
                    <p>In event open armed conflict or other unmistakable crisis growing out of
                        border troubles, it possible <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        side with Afghanistan. In such case, we would seem to have no alternative
                        but unstinting support Pakistan, while, if chaos in Afghanistan should
                        result, Russians might seize opportunity to attempt installation pro-Soviet
                        regime. However, it our guess Russians at this time would not want this
                        issue to create a new crisis, one of East-West conflict, forcing them take
                        sides either in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or in field. They must
                        feel they are doing well at present in Afghanistan and they have made a
                        small but impressive beginning toward a more favorable position in Pakistan.
                        We believe Soviets would prefer play long-term <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23"
                            facs="0049"/>political game for assured route to sea rather than short
                        quick showdown to absorb Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Thus Soviets might conclude their interests best served by adopting hands-off
                        attitude in event outbreak border hostilities. By withholding support
                        Afghanistan would be left isolated and it is doubtful if present <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> could long survive the stresses which
                        conflict with Pakistan would entail. The Soviets could well decide that
                        proximity plus the foothold already achieved would then enable them to exert
                        a decisive influence in choice of any successor government which might
                        emerge. In the meantime their refusal to back Afghanistan would have a
                        highly favorable effect on government leaders and public opinion in Pakistan
                        and greatly expand bridgeheads of neutralist sentiment which now seem
                        evident there.</p>
                    <p>For the present, the Afghans are obviously trying involve US politically in
                        dispute to maximum extent possible. This probably why <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> made his naive suggestion to me to go
                        myself as observer across border or send someone from my staff. It also
                        probably why they over-playing press [concerning] use of US equipment and US
                        involvement in support of Pakistanis. <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"

                            discussion focused on <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>'s
                            concern about the use of military equipment provided to Pakistan by the
                            United States to maintain control over what <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                                >Daud</persName> referred to as the “independent areas” of
                            Pushtunistan. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed to
                            the dilemma that the Pushtunistan dispute posed for the United States in
                            that it involved a seemingly intractable quarrel between two countries
                            with which the United States had friendly relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> suggested that it might prove
                            useful for the United States to offer its good offices to try to
                            facilitate a settlement to the dispute. (Telegram 3513 from Rome, March

                        probably be looked upon at least partially in that light, although we should
                        not deny that certain amount of honest desperation about current situation
                        may also have been a motive.</p>
                    <p>The history of US efforts either with formal good offices or in more informal
                        efforts at reconciliation has not been a happy one. Another effort would
                        seem unlikely to succeed unless Afghan position could be more realistically
                        defined and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could be convinced
                        honestly to try find some face-saving solution for <gloss target="#t_RGA1"
                            >RGA</gloss> that did not prejudice Pakistan's vital interest.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand it difficult to sit idly by and face prospect not only loss
                        of our considerable investment here but of this issue becoming active
                        additional trouble spot in world situation. One immediate thought for
                        Department to consider is whether <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> could be informally induced see <persName

                        view his [garble] past efforts am hesitant to recommend that US formally
                        urge <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to such a course. I
                        discussed such a possibility with Pakistanian Ambassador recently, making
                        clear that I not recommending such a <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"
                        />course either to him or to Washington. He seemed to feel that it might be
                        a good idea.</p>
                    <p>Department should consider whether <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> should not see <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> if possible when he returns to London. <hi
                            rend="italic">Harriman</hi> could inform <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> directly circumstances of visit with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> so as to lay any false suspicions that
                        may arise, and of course hear directly <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s side of story. Occasion might arise for <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, in obvious personal manner and
                        not under instructions of President, to query <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> as to whether it would not be worthwhile for him to see

                        try avert dangerous situation. Am encouraged in making this suggestion by
                        fact that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in discussion with
                        Rountree (Karachi telegram 216)<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Telegram 1533 from
                            Karachi, March 11, repeated to Kabul as telegram 216, reported on a
                            March 10 discussion between Rountree and Acting Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> concerning relations
                            between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Acting under instructions from
                            Washington, Rountree expressed concern about the use of equipment
                            provided to Pakistan by the United States under the military assistance
                            program. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> justified the use
                            by noting that Afghan agents were actively fomenting unrest in the
                            Pathan tribal regions along the border with Afghanistan. Pakistan had to
                            use what means it had for internal security purposes, but he assured
                            Rountree that military equipment provided by the United States would not
                            be used in connection with the dispute with Afghanistan except within
                            Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> concluded that
                            the dispute should be susceptible to solution by personal diplomacy by
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>. (Ibid.)</note> did not rule out
                        possibility of direct <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> meeting. It admittedly hard to see
                        what concession either party would or could make, although mutual cessation
                        of propaganda and withdrawal military forces in and adjacent to sensitive
                        areas immediately comes to mind.</p>
                    <p>Will continue study what US might usefully do and forward any new thoughts
                        that come to us.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I appreciate your letter of February 15<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> which was handed to me by
                        Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> on March 7. I
                        like its plain speaking and directness. This is not a time when problems
                        should be obscured by friendly generalities. I agree with you that the force
                        of communism has the ‘fixed and unshakable aim of world conquest and
                        domination through whatever means might be considered effective in any given
                        set of circumstances—subversion, instigation or aggression.' As I see it,
                        this is the force which we must stop throughout the free world and weaken
                        within the Sino-Soviet bloc itself. I can assure you that the United States
                        has the determination to do this.</p>
                    <p>I was interested in your analysis of the resentment felt in some
                        underdeveloped regions—feelings which have become crystalized against the
                        Western powers, particularly the United States. As you know, the United
                        States is not a colonial power and there are not many colonial powers, at
                        least as usually defined by history, left in the world. More often than not,
                        demagogues whip this dead or dying horse for their own ends, and are
                        prompted to do so by those with sinister motives. Most colonial areas, again
                        using their historical definition, are well on the road to being
                        decolonialized, and in most cases are being materially assisted by the West
                        in the process. It is not too difficult to foresee a period when the only
                        territories left that can be described as colonialized will be the
                        Sino-Soviet satellites and the Chinese Communist and Soviet provinces, in
                        the Central Asian Muslim areas and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>I know that I need not reaffirm the friendship which we in the United States
                        feel toward the people of Pakistan. Our common goals, and our mutual
                        understanding of the motivations of anti-western forces serve only to
                        strengthen the ties of friendship between our two countries. The United
                        States is seeking world peace with justice for all nations and it will
                        continue to do so. Fortunately, we have friends and allies, such as
                        Pakistan, who are pursuing the same ends.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know how helpful and informative my conversations with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> and Ambassador <persName

                            >Harriman</persName>. He said he had been tremendously impressed by

                        present administration, which he thought would take initiative in world
                        affairs consistent with U.S. leadership role. He said that, speaking
                        frankly, “people” had felt that speeches made in course U.S. election
                        campaign had indicated there would be change in American attitudes toward
                        Pakistan and other allies <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0053"/>to their
                        detriment, but he had never felt so himself. He knew U.S. needed Pakistan as
                        Pakistan needed U.S. He had felt for some time that U.S. was losing its
                        leadership; that previous administration lacked power of quick decision. He
                        thought this situation would be greatly improved under new leadership. He
                        said his government was trying to improve relations with other countries and
                        had taken some steps to “normalize” Pakistan's relations with China and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Nevertheless, focal point of
                        Pakistan's policy continued to be friendship with U.S. and we could count on
                        Pakistan as true friend and ally. He had no doubt as to intentions of
                        Communist bloc to achieve world domination, and only way of preventing this
                        was for free world to stand together.</p>

                            >Harriman</persName> told Ayub of his talk in Rome with <persName

                        generally. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> reiterated his desire
                        have good relations with Afghanistan, but expressed great annoyance with
                        Afghan activities and fact country seemed becoming more under influence
                        Soviet Union. He reviewed his talks with <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName> January 1960 along lines previously reported, and
                        described Bajaur operations of last September. He said this had resulted in
                        trouble between Afghan tribes and <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> and
                        said <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> had employed force, including
                        Soviet supplied aircraft, against dissident tribal elements. He had hoped
                        Afghans had learned lesson as result crushing defeat inflicted by Pakistan
                        tribes upon intruders. However, current intelligence reports indicated
                        substantial military build-up in Afghan territory across from Bajaur. He
                        thought between five and eight brigades were in position. Afghan agents
                        extremely active in Pakistan tribal area endeavoring foment revolt.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> mentioned Afghan
                        complaint that Pakistanis using US military equipment, including planes for
                        bombing in tribal region. He said while we recognized <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> right to maintain internal security, he
                        concerned that use of US equipment had become issue in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>We were making efforts to avoid having Afghan turn more to Soviets and it was
                        our hope that current troubles would be handled with restraint. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded that he sure Pakistan had
                        enough equipment of its own to deal with Afghanistan intrusions into
                        Pakistan. Although he did not say that American aircraft would not be used
                        in future, he described reconnaissance operation and small-scale bombing of
                        two houses and said those had been grossly exaggerated by Afghanistan. He
                        said we could be certain Pakistan would behave in responsible manner.</p>
                    <p>In course this talk President said he understood why US extending aid to
                        Afghan and stated our common hope was that Afghanistan would be saved from
                        Soviet takeover. He was not optimistic as to prospects of success so long as
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> in control. Foreign Minister
                        commented he thought US should continue its aid programs in Afghanistan and

                    <p>India and <persName>Nehru</persName>: <hi rend="italic">Ayub</hi> told
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> of his talks with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> in London. He had told
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> of his earnest wish to come to agreement on
                        water problems between India and East Pakistan arising from desire each
                        country build dams on Ganges River which might affect the other. He had
                        suggested that commission headed by Pakistani Minister go to India to
                        negotiate with similar Indian commission. <persName>Nehru</persName> had
                        been receptive to this idea and had asked <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> write him letter setting forth his plan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> encouraged to believe this problem
                        might be worked out satisfactorily and had told <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        so. He had gone on to say he wanted to work out all problems with India,
                        particularly Kashmir. He had told <persName>Nehru</persName> solution to
                        Kashmir problem would bring Indo-Pakistan relations to point where both
                        governments could effect substantial savings in their defense budgets, and
                        could concentrate upon defense matters affecting them both. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said, however, that while he was
                        talking about Kashmir <persName>Nehru</persName> assumed his “far away
                        attitude” and did not respond.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> set forth at length his views on
                        importance of solution to Kashmir problem and his belief that US should do
                        more to bring <persName>Nehru</persName> around to negotiation. He was
                        concerned that if problem not settled while <persName>Nehru</persName> alive
                        it would be extremely difficult to settle it later. This issue poisoned
                        relations between two countries and made it impossible for them to make
                        progress as otherwise would be the case.</p>
                    <p>In course discussion of India, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        again expressed fear that India would disintegrate in years to come and that
                        portions at least would become Communist. <persName>Nehru</persName> and
                        Congress Party were now cohesive force, but with departure of present
                        leadership stresses and strains within country would greatly intensify under
                        Communist pressure. He understood concept of US aid to India and recognized
                        this in interest not only of US but of Pakistan and rest of free world. He
                        felt objective of American aid would be greatly advanced and that future
                        prospect of India would be improved if Kashmir problem worked out so that
                        India and Pakistan could cooperate rather than live as enemies.</p>

                            xml:id="d11fn4">In telegram 1483 from Karachi, March 3, Rountree

                                >Ayub</persName> outlined what he said was the increasing threat to
                            Pakistan's security posed by China. The best prospect for avoiding
                            difficulties with China lay, he felt, in reaching agreement with the
                            Chinese on the demarcation of the disputed border between Pakistan and
                            China. (Ibid., 396.01-VI/3-361)</note> He had emphasized that
                        negotiations based upon <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> desire to avoid
                        trouble with China and not any desire to embarrass India. He had also
                        recognized possibility of arrangement <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0055"
                        />between Moscow and Peking in which Moscow giving impression of being
                        sympathetic to India vis-a-vis China and Chinese giving impression sympathy
                        with Pakistan vis-a-vis India. He had said he would not fall in that trap.
                        This matter discussed further in presence of Foreign Minister and myself. In
                        aside to me Foreign Minister commented that while original intention had
                        been to confine negotiations to Hunza border, more recently it had been
                        decided it would not be practical to do this. Thus <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> thinking of discussing with Chinese arrangement covering
                        entire Sinkiang border from Afghanistan to a projection of cease-fire line.
                        Arrangements would be entirely on de facto basis and would provide an
                        understanding as to point beyond which Chinese military would not go in
                        direction of Pakistani territory, and point beyond which Pakistani military
                        would not go in direction Sinkiang, leaving aside legal question as to where
                        border in fact exists. I asked whether he thought placing discussion on this
                        basis would render Indians any less opposed and he replied that he did not
                        know. He commented that at time of <persName>Nehru</persName>'s visit last
                        September <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> intention negotiate with China
                        was discussed and each side showed other its maps. At that time
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had not seemed unduly disturbed over prospect
                        of talks between China and Pakistan. (I might comment that this discussion

                        and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meetings was evidence of this.
                        We valued our allies and intend continue work with them in spirit of
                        alliances. Nevertheless, we considered it important to US and to free world
                        generally that neutral nations be supported and helped, and it was intention
                        of administration to do this. He pointed out that most so-called neutral
                        countries were not in fact neutral in terms of their determination to
                        preserve independence and to avoid being taken over by Communists. In order
                        to do this they required assistance and we felt US, along with other western
                        countries, must earnestly support them. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> did not dissent from this philosophy
                        and indeed seemed to understand and agree with it. His main point was that
                        while helping neutrals US should maintain distinction between them and
                        allies and pursue policies which would make it possible for nations to
                        remain committed, undertaking risks which alliances entail. He spoke of
                        importance of US having strong and effective atomic deterrent and mobile
                        power, and also of having throughout world and particularly in Europe and
                        Asia friendly armies equipped to undertake military action which might
                        become necessary under concept of collective security. Without these
                        friendly forces US could never hope to have enough military resources to <pb

                            Central Files, 751J.00/3-2261)</note>
                        <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0057"/>After discussing policies of new
                        administration, he said he had developed confidence and respect for
                        President even before the inauguration and admired greatly the statements
                        and actions taken since. I explained our opposition to admission of Red
                        China to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and determination to honor
                        commitments to Formosa. He replied that he understood the background of
                        position on Red China. He said he is greatly disturbed by Peking's
                        aggressive attitude and believes the danger to world comes from Peking
                        rather than Moscow. He thinks Khrushchev is having considerable difficulty
                        with Peking as shown by the acrimonious exchange in November at Moscow.
                        Sooner or later, he believes, the historic conflict between China and Russia
                        will weaken the present alliance but not for some years; the Soviets must be
                        worried about the aggressive policies of Peking. He agreed that disarmament
                        or arms limitation was the most important subject for discussion with Moscow
                        but that any agreement reached would need concurrence of Peking. He is
                        convinced Khrushchev does not want war and would be ready to ease tensions
                        if it were not for Peking. He recalled the Mohammedan crusades of the past.
                        Today same words which led to “conversion by the sword” are spoken by
                        Moslems but aggressive intentions are gone. Soviets, similarly, speak
                        vigorously but their fire for converting others to Communism by force has
                        lost much of its intensity. In reply, I pointed out that Berlin and other
                        specific situations showed continued Soviet aggressive intentions and that
                        they were practicing brinkmanship and would exploit any free world
                        weakness.</p>
                    <p><persName>Nehru</persName> said the Chinese Communists were at height of
                        their aggressive intentions and the situation is dangerous. He had tried to
                        negotiate with Chou En-lai on the boundary question but had gotten nowhere.
                        When I mentioned to him <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                        statement that he would negotiate with Peking settlement on the undefined
                        boundary in the Hunza area, <persName>Nehru</persName> said China has
                        settled with Burma and might with Pakistan to show “unreasonableness of
                        India.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke at some length on Indian-Pakistan relations saying that Kashmir
                        provided the basic division. He blamed Pakistani politicians for continuing
                        to whip up the issue, stating he is prepared to settle on the boundaries as
                        they now are.</p>
                    <p>We discussed Iran. He said it unfortunate US had backed unpopular governments
                        and that aid had not in some cases gone to help the people; nevertheless,
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> seems to be the only one who
                        could give stability at this time.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0058"/>
                    <p>On Congo he said all trouble comes from Belgian interference. He admitted
                        Soviets had also tried intervene last summer but they had been thrown out;
                        Nasser's attempts to supply Gizenga had not been successful because of
                        Sudan's attitude. In discussing <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Dayal</persName>,
                        he said he hoped <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Dayal</persName> could return
                        and be sent to Pakistan but he did not want to have him forced out under
                        fire. I, of course, expressed appreciation for India's support of <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by supply of troops.</p>
                    <p>In speaking of Laos, <persName>Nehru</persName> said that no government could
                        be successful without inclusion of the Pathet Lao. He contends that majority
                        of Pathet Lao are not Communists but if opposition to them is continued they
                        will be driven closer to Communists. He maintained that the only authority
                        for intervention is the Geneva Agreement. It is up to Soviet Union and
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to decide whether the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is to be convened or something else. He did
                        not seem to be familiar with the NNC concept and stuck to legalistic
                        position that Soviet Union and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as
                        co-chairmen should take the lead.<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3"><persName

                            steps that might help stop the fighting between Pathet Lao and Royal
                            Laotian forces. (Ibid., 751J.00/3-2361) <persName>Nehru</persName>
                            responded that he would do everything he could to assist in obtaining an

                    <p>We discussed possibility of his visiting Washington. He said that it would be
                        inconvenient for him to contemplate a trip in near future but that he did
                        want to see the President at a time when it would be mutually agreeable.
                        This, he agreed, I should tell the press.</p>

                    <p>It is proposed that the United States indicate at the forthcoming Consortium
                        of free world countries on India (April 25-27) a willingness to commit up to
                        $1 billion in the next two years in support of India's external resource
                        requirements in the Third Five-Year Plan period. It is also proposed that a
                        United States commitment be indicated at the Pakistan Consortium meeting,
                        now scheduled for late May to consider Pakistan's Second Five-Year Plan.
                        While we cannot suggest with precision an appropriate amount for a Pakistan
                        commitment, it would probably be of the order of magnitude of $250,000,000.
                        Each commitment would include all United States dollar assistance but would
                        not include food provided under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480. The
                        commitments would be made explicitly subject (a) to the availability of
                        United States funds, (b) to the provision of assistance by other advanced
                        nations as noted in Section III of the attached study entitled Proposals for
                        United States <gloss target="#t_AID1">Aid</gloss> Commitments to <hi

                        conditions noted in that study.</p>
                    <p>These proposals have been agreed to in substance by the appropriate officials
                        in the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of
                        the Budget, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and the <gloss

                        by the Task Force on Foreign Economic Assistance. The attached study has
                        been reviewed by Dr. <persName>Max Millikan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We believe it essential that the United States make a substantial commitment
                        to the requirements of the Indian Plan in April and to the Pakistan Plan in
                        May, recognizing that such commitments anticipate the new aid program prior
                        to Congressional consideration of the program.</p>

                    <p>That you approve the recommendations in the attached document.<note n="2"

                    <p>1832. In meeting last evening President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> said he wished discuss Afghanistan. His evaluation was
                        that, following abortive Laskar intrusion last September, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> had been under increasing pressure in
                        Afghanistan including members of Royal Family who were becoming more
                        concerned by his pro-Soviet policies. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        saw in <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> willing tool for their
                        purposes and were endeavoring support him. Thus they were willing to make
                        public statements on Pushtunistan even though this set back their objectives
                        to create better position for themselves in Pakistan. It could be expected
                        that Soviets would continue give strong support to <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>, including economic and military
                        assistance. <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>'s tactics seemed
                        focused in two primary directions. First, to obtain Soviet support to him
                        personally and to his efforts to create a situation in tribal regions of
                        Pakistan which would permit Afghans to take matter to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> in hope of building up sympathy for their position.
                        Secondly, to work on the Americans in order to achieve continuation of
                        American assistance to Afghanistan, but more importantly to bring Americans
                        to press Pakistanis not to employ force in maintenance of internal security
                        on Pakistan side of Durand Line.</p>
                    <p>President said he had had several reports of conversations which <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> had had with American officials in which
                        they complained about use of American arms by <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> in tribal region. He had been surprised that there had been
                        little indication that response to Afghan officials had included strong
                        reaffirmation of US position on Durand Line, and that we had not pointed out
                        to Afghans that Pakistanis had perfect right to take whatever measures were
                        appropriate to preserve their internal security. Afghan demarches seem to
                        have been based on assumption that Afghans had some right to intrude in
                        Pakistani territory. It seemed to him that American officials had at times
                        equated Afghan intrusions into Pakistan with Pakistani use of American arms
                        for internal security purposes.</p>
                    <p>He said his concern had grown as result demarches which I had made to
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> (<gloss
                            target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1533)<note n="1" xml:id="d15fn1">See
                            footnote 4, Document 9<!--no such footnote, errata? TODO-->.</note> and
                        others and comments which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> had made to him concerning use of American
                        equipment in tribal regions. He said he was keeping these representations
                        secret since if Pakistan press and public should come to know that US <pb
                            n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0061"/>had reservations about employment by
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> for internal security purposes of
                        military equipment supplied under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>,
                        resentment would be tremendous and it would have an extremely adverse effect
                        on Pakistani-American relations. He said American arms were provided to
                        Pakistan for several specific reasons set forth in the agreement, principal
                        one being for use in maintaining internal security. Pakistan forces were
                        equipped with American arms and arms could not be changed depending upon
                        purpose for, or area in, which they were to be employed. It so happened that
                        forces most likely to come in contact with Laskar intrusion were not
                        equipped by <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> but from <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> resources. Also, limited air bombings that
                        had been carried out included only one American plane which had been used
                        along with several old British planes. However, the region in question was
                        extremely remote and it would be difficult and he thought unwise for
                        Pakistanis to deploy forces in these remote regions in Pakistan when need
                        for this now obviated by air reconnaissance and, if need be, action from the
                        air.</p>
                    <p>President emphasized he felt US should be more frank with Afghans in citing
                        right of Pakistan self-defense in connection with any intrusions across
                        border. He said Afghans were pouring money and weapons into tribal area.
                        Notorious Afghan agent Bacha Gul had been moving about widely in Bajaur
                        region distributing largesse and arms, and endeavoring to foment revolt.
                        Afghans should not be led to believe that US considered this to be normal
                        and proper.</p>
                    <p>I told President that we of course recognized Durand Line as border and we
                        also recognized that Pakistan had a right to defend itself and to preserve
                        internal security. One of purposes of our military aid program was to permit
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to preserve its integrity and
                        stability. Nevertheless, we had been concerned about employment of American
                        arms in this sensitive region and I had, under instructions from the
                        Department, asked Pakistanis to endeavor to carry out their responsibilities
                        without employing American aid weapons, and to act in this sensitive region
                        with restraint. I had expressed this hope particularly in connection with
                        air operations. President said Pakistanis did not want to start any trouble
                        that could be avoided. Pakistan would have to defend itself, however, if
                        attacked, and it could defend itself only with weapons in hands of its
                        military personnel. We could be certain that they would only be employed for
                        purposes specified in our agreement, and he hoped that situation would not
                        arise.</p>

                        <item>Report on India Consortium Meeting</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The subject meeting convened on April 25 to consider the amounts required by
                        India both to meet its payments in 1961-62 and 1962-63 and to provide for
                        the placement of new orders during that period.</p>
                    <p>On the opening day the United States made its offer of $1 billion of aid on
                        the terms and conditions approved by you on April 21. Because proposed
                        commitments by other countries, particularly Germany, were insufficient to
                        total the needed remaining $1.1 billion believed by the U.S. to be required
                        from these nations, the meeting recessed until May 31. In the interim, these
                        other participants will, in the light of the large offer of the United
                        States, reconsider their commitments. The press release on the adjournment
                        of the meeting, however, merely stated that the participants had met,
                        examined the Indian program, decided that it offered a reasonable basis for
                        undertaking commitments, and adjourned to consider what each could do.</p>
                    <p>The true reason for the adjournment was the fact that commitments offered by
                        others than the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> fell
                        about $500 million short of what is generally believed necessary to move the
                        Indian program ahead. While most other participants offered commitments
                        close to our expectations, West Germany was about $300 million short in what
                        we have believed it capable of providing. It offered to make available $331
                        million, about half of which would refund existing Indian debts to Germany.
                        Furthermore, even this grossly inadequate contribution was to be extended on
                        very hard terms rather than the softer terms and conditions considered
                        necessary in the Indian situation.</p>
                    <p>The United Kingdom offered $204 million, the Japanese $80 million, and the
                            <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> $400 million. The Canadian offer
                        of $36 million was not up to expectations but we believe it can be
                        increased. It is also believed that the U.K. offer can be increased.</p>
                    <p>Before the Consortium reconvenes on May 31 the following actions are being
                        undertaken: <list>

                        influencing the Canadians to extend additional resources.</p>
                    <p>It is our hope that these actions will result in more adequate commitments by

                    <p>My Dear Mr. President, I write to thank you for the generous approach which
                        the United States Government has made in regard to the assistance to India
                        for her Third Five Year Plan. The United States Ambassador here has informed
                        us that at the meeting convened by the World Bank, the United States
                        Government offered a thousand million dollars by way of aid to India for the
                        first two years of the Third Five Year Plan. This aid is in addition to the
                        large quantities of wheat and rice which have already been promised under
                        PL-480. A special feature of the United States aid to India's development
                        plans, which we appreciate greatly and which is of particular value to us,
                        is that repayments in foreign exchange have been reduced to the minimum.</p>
                    <p>The United States Ambassador has pointed out to our Planning Commission the
                        importance of allowing the recipient of aid the maximum flexibility in
                        regard to the purposes for which the funds can be utilised. This is
                        particularly welcome to us. In the past, credits from the <pb n="40"
                            xml:id="pg_40" facs="0066"/>Development Loan Fund have been available
                        mainly for the purchase of capital goods in the U.S.A. We have, during the
                        Second Five Year Plan, built up certain capital goods industries ourselves.
                        These depend upon the import of raw materials and components not available
                        from indigenous sources which we hope the D.L.F. will finance. There are
                        also other needs of ours which we require for development and which are not
                        in the nature of capital goods, e.g., fertilisers for our agricultural
                        economy. We are anxious, therefore, to have as much flexibility as is
                        possible in regard to the use of these funds.</p>
                    <p>May I thank you again, Mr. President, for your generous approach to our
                        problems and also for exercising your country's great influence on the other
                        participants of the aid programme so as to raise the quantum of aid to a
                        level which will be commensurate with India's needs for the execution of her
                        Third Five Year Plan.</p>

                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> opened the
                        session by explaining that his party had come to India at the request of

                        President to India's Prime Minister<note n="1" xml:id="d20fn1">In this
                            letter, dated May 8, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            expressed the hope that <persName>Nehru</persName> and
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> would enjoy a fruitful exchange of
                            views, and that <persName>Johnson</persName> would be able to observe
                            and report on economic progress in India. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> applauded India's efforts to promote such
                            progress and noted that his administration was engaged in reorganizing
                            its aid programs to be able to enter into longer-range commitments to
                            better support such efforts. He also expressed appreciation for
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>'s support for the attempt to achieve a
                            cease-fire agreement in Laos. (Kennedy Library, National Security Files,
                            Countries Series, India, <persName>Nehru</persName> Correspondence,
                            4/1/61-10/31/61)</note> and to engage in such discussions as might help
                        the United States to take actions in South and Southeast Asia that would be
                        beneficial to the peoples of that area and to the cause of human liberty.
                        The Vice President said that he had come also because President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> wanted the people of the area to
                        know that the United States was aware of the need for economic progress in
                        the area, and that the United States was determined to work in close
                        cooperation with those nations attempting to raise the living standards of
                        their people.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said it was the belief of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> Administration that military force alone can never
                        be a permanent bulwark against Communist activities which are leading to
                        widespread discontent, and in some cases violent insurrection, in Asia. He
                        warned that he was in no position to make specific commitments as to the
                        degree of United States participation in any development program, because
                        only Congress has authority to make the necessary appropriations. He said
                        that he felt confident that, given a full understanding of the difficulties
                        and challenges in the area, Congress would respond with the necessary
                        boldness.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> expressed great
                        pleasure at this line of talk, asserting that economic development is “a
                        subject that fills my heart and mind.” He said that India is struggling to
                        raise standards of living and develop the country's resources “without
                        resorting to a doctrinaire approach.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister seemed emotionally touched when he referred to the letter
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> that Mr.
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> delivered. He said that he and India
                        “appreciate President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s
                        concern and generosity.” Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> went on to express
                        the opinion that poverty—the whole economic problem—is at the heart of the
                        problems of Asia and Africa. “All other problems in India are secondary to
                        the economic problem, and in many cases are affected by it.” He continued,
                        “We have a politically-conscious mass of people who think that they deserve
                        everything—and they do—but India is unable to supply it.”</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that he was sure that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> and other Americans could
                        understand the economic or surface aspect of this dilemma, but that he
                        doubted that they could understand the emotional aspects of it the way Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> did.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0068"/>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and the Prime
                        Minister then discussed at some length India's third Five Year Plan. The
                        Prime Minister said that progress under this scheme was aimed at aiding
                        India's 16 million unemployed, and that about 13 million workers would be
                        absorbed in the plan, but that the employment problem would probably be even
                        more acute at the end of five years because the development program will not
                        keep up with the population increase.</p>
                    <p>The two leaders then discussed education and necessity of spreading it
                        throughout the population if the country is to make real progress against
                        poverty, illiteracy and disease. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that
                        currently only 60% of India's boys and 20% to 30% of her girls are in
                        school, but that the hope is at the end of the third Five Year Plan free and
                        compulsory education will be available for every boy and girl in the 7 to 11
                        age group.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President inquired as to the size and goals of India's third Five
                        Year Plan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                        pointed out that the plan involves an investment of 102 billion rupees or
                        almost 20 billion dollars, as compared with 67 billion rupees (13-1/2
                        billion dollars) in India's second Five Year Plan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that the external segment of the third
                        plan, which includes private investments, is about 6 billion dollars.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> pointed out that
                        India's planning for economic development is greatly admired, and that India
                        is representative of the nations the United States wants most to work with,
                        because India's leaders are determined to see that the mass of the people
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then discussed the impact of reform programs and efforts
                        to extend social justice in any movement to create political stability. He
                        asked Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s advice with regard to South and
                        Southeast Asia. The Prime Minister said that he was reluctant to talk about
                        other countries but that he felt any progress must have impact on the people
                        generally. He said that he was certain that people would be willing to wait,
                        and would not fall for the lure of totalitarianism if they could see a trend
                        of progress moving in their direction. He said that in the case of India it
                        was absolutely essential to build up industry, because progress never could
                        be sufficient as long as 80% of the people depended on agriculture for their
                        livelihood. He said that India is decentralizing and giving more authority
                        to village councils in order to get human beings interested in their country
                        and its problems.</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> lauded those
                        steps as a grass roots movement certain to have a remarkable effect.</p>
                    <p>The two then discussed farming cooperatives, land reform, irrigation and
                        rural electrification. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that taking
                        electric power to rural areas is one of the biggest revolutionary forces
                        operating in less developed areas. Near the end of the discussion the Vice
                        President asked the Prime Minister for his advice as to how situations such
                        as that existing <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0069"/>in Laos might be
                        avoided, thus giving the peoples of the area the opportunity to make the
                        progress of which the two leaders had spoken. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        said that he would reiterate that there must be social and economic
                        approaches to the problems of Southeast Asia, because military solutions
                        alone never did work. He said that land reform was vitally necessary,
                        pointing to Iran as a good example of a country where poor land ownership
                        policies make the country vulnerable to outside interference and
                        agitation.</p>
                    <p>When the session was terminated because of another appointment of the Vice
                        President, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> said
                        that he would welcome further discussions.</p>

                            been formalized. (Ibid., 789.5-<gloss target="#t_MSP1"

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DSK1">Dehlavi</persName>, Foreign Secretary</p>
                    <p>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> began by
                        stating that Pakistan was held in very high regard by the United States,
                        which greatly valued its friendship. He mentioned in the context of his
                        public life his interest in international affairs, and the various trips
                        abroad which he had made on official missions since he assumed office as the
                        Vice President. He described President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> as a young and extremely vigorous man, hopeful and
                        very confident. The Vice President fully shared President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s philosophy. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had wanted him to visit nations of
                        Asia, particularly allies, to talk about problems of common interest and to
                        share views of how the strength of the free world might be increased. The
                        United States was anxious to do everything it could to contribute to the
                        strength of Asian nations, particularly in the fostering of economic
                        progress upon which strength could be based. It felt that impoverished
                        nations must be helped; in helping them we were in fact helping ourselves
                        since those more fortunate must share the burden of improving the lot of the
                        poorer if even the rich were to be secure. Continuing, the Vice President
                        said United States had a particular fondness for Pakistan and President
                        Ayub. Pakistan had convictions which it was willing to express. It was
                        willing to support <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, including the
                        contribution of forces in connection with the Laos problem, and we
                        appreciated that commitment. The Vice President observed that he did not
                        know where recent events in Laos left us. He wanted to exchange views with
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> on this subject.</p>
                    <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0072"/>
                    <p>The Vice President said that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> was eagerly looking forward to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s visit, during which many matters
                        could be discussed; however, there was substantial business which would have
                        to take place before the visit. (In this context he handed President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> a letter from President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.)<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d22fn1"><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s letter,
                            dated May 8, underlined the importance of <persName>Johnson</persName>'s
                            fact-finding mission and the significance <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> attached to <persName>Johnson</persName>'s
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. He pointed
                            to the need to build military strength to resist Communist aggression in
                            the area and noted that such strength rested upon economic development.
                            He applauded Pakistan's efforts to promote economic development and
                            noted that his administration was engaged in reorganizing its aid
                            programs in order to better support such efforts. (Department of State,
                            Central Files, 611.90D/5-861)</note></p>
                    <p>The Vice President said that in his visits to several countries of Asia he
                        had found them all aware of the current danger and anxious to do their best
                        to meet it. All the leaders believed they had inadequate means for
                        accomplishing what they considered necessary. We were anxious to do
                        everything that we reasonably could to help them. We recognized the need for
                        additional defensive strength, but even more the need for economic
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>Referring to Laos, the Vice President said we were prepared for the worst but
                        hoped for the best. He would like to have President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s view as to what would be the best
                        course to follow. There were various alternatives. The United States could,
                        for example, “go back to San Francisco,” but we did not want to do that. On
                        the other hand, our people did not want to get killed in unnecessary and
                        fruitless fighting. He said we had relied on our allies to help train
                        Laotians. This had not worked out well, and the other side seemed far more
                        willing to fight than ours. In Viet-Nam 150,000 friendly forces were
                        confronting 10,000 enemy. Yet they needed even more men and equipment to
                        cope with the problem. In Thailand there were similar difficulties. The
                        problem of the defense of free forces in South Asia would of course be far
                        greater if the Chinese should come in. Yet Diem had said that if we gave him
                        help he would stand up, and Sarit said he needed not nine but 15
                        divisions.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said he would like to be able to inform President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> of what we could expect
                        from our allies if the United States was ready to do thus and so for the
                        area. The United States did not want anything for itself beyond the
                        preservation of the independence of the states of the region. The question
                        was what would be necessary to prevent the communists from gobbling up the
                        weaker nations. It was possible that we could equip them and help them fight
                        properly. If they were not helped, they would be lost. It would be one or
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded that he
                        agreed with the Vice President's summary of the problem. He said he would
                        like to outline at length his views on the world situation, but in view of
                        the shortage of time he <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0073"/>thought it
                        best for the Vice President simply to read his assessment which had been
                        prepared in summary form for the purposes of the meeting. He handed to the
                        Vice President his notes, which are attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">Not
                            attached.</note></p>
                    <p>The Vice President agreed generally with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s views, but commented upon his
                        remarks about American policy by saying that we sometimes might be
                        “kindhearted but not wise.” We did, however, know who stood up, and the
                        difference between strong friends and neutrals. Regarding possible influence
                        by the United States or India to bring about a solution of the Kashmir
                        problem, he thought President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        attributed to us a capacity which the Vice President was not sure we had. We
                        had tried some of these things, but had had little influence with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> on the question.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded that he knew
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> would not listen if he did not feel compelled
                        to. That did not mean that he should not listen, nor that the United States
                        did not have the power to influence him. India's flexibility today was gone.
                        With the pressure from the Chinese Communists, India relied even more
                        heavily upon the United States. In fact, it had no alternative.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, the President said the United States was Pakistan's friend and
                        anything going wrong with the United States hurt Pakistan. In Cuba, for
                        example, a situation had been created which greatly damaged not only the
                        United States, but also its allies, including Pakistan. He mentioned the
                        conversation which he had had with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                            >Rountree</persName> on the Cuban situation and the message which he had
                        sent through the Ambassador to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> on the subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3"
                            >Transmitted in telegram 1831 from Karachi, April 19. (Department of
                            State, Central Files, 737.00/4-1961)</note> Pakistan did not want to the
                        United States to fail. It wanted it to win against the Soviets. Its battle
                        was Pakistan's battle. If the United States did not use its power, it hurt
                        Pakistan. The power of the United States was much greater than at times the
                        Americans seemed to think. Its power to influence <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        was very great indeed. Unless there were peace with India which would permit
                        cooperation in the defense of South Asia, there would be a very great threat
                        within a few years and that threat derived from the fact that the communists
                        wanted to control the entire subcontinent. The Soviets were pressing
                        Pakistan and would like to take over the country, but their interest was not
                        in Pakistan itself but in the entire region. Thus, the threat to India was
                        very great, both from the Soviets and from the Chinese Communists, and the
                        Indians must come to realize that. The United States was spending a terrific
                        amount of money in India. It was doing it because it sought Indian security.
                        It could not, however, say that India really was secure. The Indians must do
                        far more to achieve real security and this <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48"
                            facs="0074"/>involved the creation of a situation in which good
                        relations between Pakistan and India could be maintained. American
                        diffidence about <persName>Nehru</persName> bothered the Pakistani. The
                        United States should help India; but by the same token it should demand that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> help create security in the area around
                        India. Thus India should make peace and cooperation with Pakistan
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The President was disturbed by the fact that the Communists gave support to
                        any friend regardless of the merits of the case, but they assured themselves
                        that the countries helped would not operate against their global policies or
                        their world position. Failure of the United States to support its friends
                        created a one-sided proposition that Americans seemed not to realize.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> only wanted American economic assistance, and
                        the assurance of help if he should get into difficulties with the Chinese.
                        He would never help the United States. His policies were in fact extremely
                        harmful to the United States; yet America had not used its leverage to bring
                        about a change in those policies, despite <persName>Nehru</persName>'s very
                        heavy reliance upon it.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President responded again that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> attributed to us the capacity for greater influence
                        with <persName>Nehru</persName> than we in fact possessed. He did not in
                        fact think that <persName>Nehru</persName> would listen to us on the Kashmir
                        question.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> remarked that he would
                        listen if the United States should say that it would not otherwise give him
                        all the help he asked. The Vice President remarked that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was suggesting the “quid pro quo”
                        approach, to which President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        responded that he thought it would be a very good idea when dealing with
                        that type of person. He said again that the United States had very great
                        power and that it should use it. It should not be bluffed by Khrushchev; it
                        should do in a straightforward manner what was necessary for the American
                        and free world position.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the Vice President's question about what should be done about
                        Viet-Nam and other Asian trouble spots, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that if the present leadership in
                        those countries could not run their affairs, they should get someone able to
                        do so. It must be seen to that they were operated properly. If the leaders
                        could not get that bulk of the people to resist communism, the United States
                        should see to it that key people were in the right places to do so. He
                        thought the situation in Laos was extremely bad. Militarily, it was a
                        nightmare. The Thais were beginning to get the jitters. He thought American
                        military people in Thailand, Laos and Viet-Nam should be in a position to
                        assume command responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought the Tibetan
                        situation would have a considerable influence in India. Through Tibet, the
                        Chinese Communists were already penetrating India, not physically but in
                        influence, particularly in <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0075"/>the
                        Calcutta area. Fortunately the large communist party in India was presently
                        split over the Chinese situation. If this were not so the problem would be
                        even greater than it was today. Responding to the Vice President's question,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that China's
                        current economic problems were not substantially lessening Chinese
                        activities in other countries. They were in fact even more aggressive in
                        Africa than the Soviets. The Chinese were not likely, due to their own
                        internal difficulties, to concentrate on a single part of the world, such as
                        Laos, to the exclusion of others.</p>
                    <p>Responding to the Vice President's question about <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        said no one seemed to want to fight “except us.” The Vice President remarked
                        that we appreciated Pakistan's willingness to contribute forces to which
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded, jokingly,
                        that he thought however that the United States should come along with them.
                        The Vice President observed that it still had not yet been decided what
                        would be necessary in Laos. Considering what other countries were prepared
                        to do and contribute, he doubted that much of a fight could be put up there.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that any sort
                        of a fight by the Royal Laotians would mean that the army must be directly
                        commanded by United States officers; otherwise they simply would not
                        fight.</p>
                    <p>The President remarked that Thailand was relatively easier to defend, to
                        which the Vice President responded that he thought we would have to make a
                        stand much before Thailand was attacked.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> described the size and
                        disposition of the Pakistani forces, in reply to the Vice President's
                        question. He said that Pakistan had an excellent army but that it needed
                        more equipment and more mobility. These needs had been described to the
                        American authorities and he hoped that it would be possible for them to be
                        met in light of the tremendous advantages to the United States and the free
                        world of Pakistan having a strong military force capable of real help in
                        meeting the threat in this part of the world.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President thought it would be an excellent idea if President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could visit the leaders of
                        other Asian nations and talk with them about some of these problems. The
                        President remarked that he recently had visited several countries. He was,
                        however, very busy at the moment and did not see how it would be possible
                        for him to undertake other visits.</p>
                    <p>Turning to another subject, President Ayub and the Vice President discussed
                        economic problems and development of Pakistan. The President and Finance
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> described the
                        magnitude of the five year program and its general content. Replying to the
                        Vice President's question, they said the annual deficit in foreign exchange
                        financing would be in the neighborhood of 500 million dollars, which it
                        hoped <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0076"/>could be financed through
                        contributions by the nations soon to meet in the consortium group under the
                        auspices of the International Bank.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed an interest in the Peace Corps and said he hoped that
                        projects could be worked out so that specialists could be sent, particularly
                        in the fields of health, education and agriculture.</p>
                    <p>The problem of water logging and salinity was discussed at some length.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> handed to the Vice
                        President copies of the Pakistan Program for Water Logging and Salinity
                        Control in the Irrigated Areas of West Pakistan. The Vice President
                        expressed a keen interest in the problem, and said he thought every
                        consideration should be given as to what assistance the United States could
                        render. The President said that Finance Minister <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> was leaving almost immediately for Washington and was
                        taking copies of the report with him. He earnestly hoped the United States
                        could provide substantial assistance in this matter. The program covered a
                        10 year period and would involve the annual expenditure of 110 million
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>Before proceeding to lunch (during which the talks were continued),<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">Conversation over lunch dealt largely with
                            programs for education and land reform and prospects for economic
                            development in Pakistan. (Memorandum of conversation, May 20; Johnson
                            Library, Vice Presidential Security File, VP <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName>'s Trip, Far East, May 1961)</note></p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> described on the map in
                        his office the military problems confronting Pakistan and the necessary
                        disposition of Pakistani forces related to the dispute with India over
                        Kashmir. Settlement of the Kashmir problem would permit these forces to
                        concentrate entirely upon defense against possible communist aggression.
                        Another Pakistani interest in Kashmir was described by the President as
                        being the need for controlling the headwaters of rivers flowing into
                        Pakistan upon which Pakistan depended for its very existence. These were
                        practical and immediate reasons why Pakistan must find a solution to these
                        problems. There were other reasons, of course, relating to the desires of
                        the people concerned in Kashmir and of a historical nature.</p>

                        Bank for Reconstruction and Development, reconvened in Washington on May 31,
                        1961. The meeting concluded on June 2, and the Bank issued a press release
                        that indicated that members of the consortium had agreed to undertake
                        commitments of aid to India totaling over $2 billion. The commitments
                        covered fiscal years 1961/62 and 1962/63, the first 2 years of the third
                        Indian 5-year plan for economic development. <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52"
                            facs="0078"/>Contributing members of the consortium included Canada,

                        members of the consortium. The U.S. commitment for the 2-year period was
                        $1,045,000,000, including $45 million in loans made after January 15, 1961,

                    <p>2087. From Murree dated 1 June, Midnight. During meeting in Murree June 1,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> again expressed great
                        concern over US policies toward India and particularly with respect to
                        Kashmir question.</p>
                    <p>It was obvious that President, like other Pakistani officials with whom I
                        have spoken and like virtually all Pakistani press, was upset at reports of
                        Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s statement
                        following Asian tour indicating that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> and US administration wished
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s leadership to be extended over other Asian
                        countries. Most of what President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> said about <persName>Nehru</persName> and Indian
                        policies, and about need for US to support allies more and neutrals less,
                        was repetition of what he told Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                            >Johnson</persName>. His main point in our conversation was to emphasize
                        his belief that US and US alone can prevent disastrous consequences of
                        failure to arrive at solution to Kashmir problem. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that a year ago he had been
                        hopeful that <persName>Nehru</persName> was beginning to see the light and
                        things seemed to be moving in direction of talks to settle Kashmir. He felt
                        several factors had served to make <persName>Nehru</persName> more
                        intransigent, among these being US statements indicating vast support to
                        India without mention of Kashmir, somewhat lessened pressures from Chinese
                        Communists, and creation two new India divisions which should be <pb n="53"
                            xml:id="pg_53" facs="0079"/>adequate to handle immediate Chinese threat
                        in difficult terrain of disputed territories. Latter factor rendered less
                        attractive to India possibility of settling Kashmir question so that forces
                        now concerned with Kashmir could be diverted.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said it not as though there was
                        only one Kashmir solution which India would have to accept or reject. There
                        were several alternatives which could be considered if
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> willing to talk seriously. Issue was becoming
                        far more inflamed in Pakistan and no Pakistani Government could fail to
                        press matter and remain in power. Feelings on subject were rising, not
                        diminishing. He, therefore, earnestly hoped that US was giving careful
                        thought to question, and that following Vice President's return to
                        Washington means would be found of exercising US influence upon India to
                        seek a settlement. He had no doubt US recognized valid Pakistani concern and
                        interest.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> opened the conversation by
                        remarking it was no secret that Pakistan was disappointed with the results
                        of the Consortium held under the auspices of the International Bank for
                        Reconstruction and Development, June 5-7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> immediately rejoined that it was no secret that the
                        United States was also disappointed with the results. We had hoped, he said,
                        to be able to obtain a commitment by all members of the Consortium covering
                        Pakistan's requirements for two years. This had not been found possible, and
                        so it had been decided to announce initial commitments which would meet
                        Pakistan's immediate requirements and maintain the momentum of its
                        development. It was expected that a further meeting of the Consortium would
                        be called later this year to consider further commitments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin said that two considerations would determine the date of the
                        reconvened meeting. The first was the German election scheduled for
                        mid-September. The second was the time required for the Pakistanis to come
                        up with firm revisions in their Second Plan figures. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> commented that frankly he did not
                        know what more the World Bank expected them to produce in the way of
                        planning. It was true, he said, that the Plan had not been officially
                        adopted by the Government of Pakistan. Formal adoption, however, was
                        expected to take place around the middle of June. Except for this formality
                        the Plan had been accepted by the Government. <persName corresp="#p_AG1">G.
                            Ahmed</persName> reinforced this view, asserting that the Pakistan Plan
                        in this respect was more firm than the Indian Plan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said that he now faced a
                        political problem in how to present the results of the Consortium to his
                        people, since the results were so unfavorable in comparison with those of
                        the Indian Consortium. The people of Pakistan were bound to reason that as
                        allies of the West they were entitled to more favorable consideration than
                        neutrals such as India. They would inquire “What do we have to do to obtain
                        equitable treatment?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName>
                        contrasted Pakistan's planning with that of the Indians, noting that the
                        Pakistanis had not counted on Soviet aid for the financing of their Plan,
                        and that they had not so over-committed themselves with respect to resources
                        that they had to ask the rest of the world to bail them out, as had
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> then went on to contrast
                        results of the two Consortia meetings. With respect to commitments for the
                        first year, he noted, Germany had agreed to commit $225 million for India
                        compared to $25 million for Pakistan. Comparable figures for the United
                        Kingdom were $182 million for India, $19.6 million for Pakistan; for the
                        United States, $545 million for India and $150 million for Pakistan. With
                        respect to the United States, he noted that in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1959 we had extended aid in the <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55"
                            facs="0081"/>amount of $164 million, and only slightly less in the two
                        succeeding years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that it was
                        important for the Pakistanis to remember that these figures for Pakistan
                        were not for a full year, and it was therefore a mistake to make the
                        comparisons which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> had just
                        offered. So far as the United States was concerned, he reiterated, we were
                        prepared to commit substantially more than the amount of $150 million.
                        However, when the other participants had not been sufficiently forthcoming,
                        we had felt it necessary to limit our commitment to $150 million (1) in
                        order to preserve the integrity before the Congress of the principles of our
                        new aid program which stress a sharing of development assistance by the
                        capital exporting countries and (2) as the best strategy to maintain
                        pressure on others to make more generous contributions in the future.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> said he recognized the force
                        of these arguments. Nonetheless, his President would be disappointed with
                        the results in view of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName>'s message<note n="1" xml:id="d26fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d22fn2">footnote 2, Document 22</ref>.</note> which led him
                        to believe that a substantial increase in U.S. commitments would be
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> remarked that the problem for
                        the Pakistanis was one of explanation, reiterating the point that the
                        commitments at the Consortium meeting represented only an initial action,
                        and that a further meeting was contemplated this year to consider possible
                        further commitments. Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that in his press
                        conference yesterday regarding the Consortium meeting he had stressed this
                        point. Mr. <persName>Cottam</persName> noted that great care had been taken
                        in the press release on the meeting to make clear that at the resumed
                        meeting consideration would be given to Pakistan's requirements for both the
                        second and third year of the Second Plan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AG1">G. Ahmed</persName> said that since a further
                        meeting was also contemplated in the case of India no particular point could
                        be made of the fact that there was to be a subsequent meeting of Pakistan.
                        Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> commented that so far as the United States
                        was concerned we had made our full commitment in the case of India. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that the meeting on
                        Pakistan was comparable to the first meeting on India which had been
                        adjourned, the difference being that in the case of Pakistan we had made
                        public the preliminary results. <persName corresp="#p_AG1">G.
                            Ahmed</persName> suggested that it might have been better to have
                        delayed announcing the results pending the second meeting. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that since there would
                        necessarily be a considerable time before the second meeting, it was better,
                        on balance, to announce the results.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the matching concept, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1"
                            >Shoaib</persName> pointed out that the United States had traditionally
                        supplied 80-85 per cent of foreign aid <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0082"
                        />received by Pakistan. In the case of India the ratio between U.S. and
                        other assistance was more nearly 4:4 or 4:3. He thought it not realistic to
                        expect that the ratio in the case of Pakistan could be reduced at any early
                        date to a 50:50 figure. Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> agreed, commenting
                        that we were prepared for some years to see a gap in this respect.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then urged that the Pakistan
                        Government itself get in touch with the Germans to urge a larger
                        contribution by that country. The U.S. Government, he said, was reaching a
                        state of diminishing returns in its efforts to extract aid money from the
                        Germans. He thought it would be better psychologically for the Pakistanis to
                        make their own case with that government. Mr. <persName>Martin</persName>
                        expressed his wholehearted concurrence, adding that this was not to say we
                        had not made every effort to obtain a substantial German commitment to
                        Pakistan. We had, but had not been particularly successful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s suggestion, remarking that his
                        government was sending M. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> as its
                        Ambassador to Bonn specifically for this purpose. This, he said, was the
                        “one and only reason for my letting him go from my Ministry.” To the same
                        end, his Government was also strengthening its staff in London.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> next remarked that he would
                        have some difficulty stretching the immediate U.S. commitment of $150
                        million to cover current requirements. Pakistan, he said, needed to place
                        immediate orders for commodity imports to a total of perhaps $120 million.
                        This would leave only about $30 million to apply against development
                        projects, whereas their requests of the Development Loan Fund greatly
                        exceeded that figure. He wondered if perhaps they could proceed to place
                        orders in excess of whatever might be allocated to <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> out of the $150 million on the understanding that they
                        could be reimbursed by the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> when
                        additional money became available. Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said this
                        involved a legal problem for the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> which
                        would have to be explored. He also cautioned that an indicated willingness
                        by the United States to exceed its commitment at the Consortium meeting
                        might have an unfavorable influence on further European contributions. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that subsequent
                        reimbursement by the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> of orders placed
                        now was at least an idea which we could entertain in principle and which we
                        would explore.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> next inquired as to the
                        grant component of the U.S. commitment of $150 million. Mr.
                            <persName>Martin</persName> said that we would not have the answer on
                        this until the legislation had been passed. He would observe, however, that
                        the Administration was under a mandate to reduce grant aid and that it was
                        his guess that such aid, which in the case of Pakistan was described as
                        Defense Support, would be less this next year than before.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> further remarked that
                        commodity grant aid had in the past been an important source of local
                        currency for financing plan projects. Mr. <persName>Cottam</persName>
                        inquired if these could not now be replaced from the <pb n="57"
                            xml:id="pg_57" facs="0083"/>proceeds from the expanded PL-480 program
                        now in prospect. <persName corresp="#p_AG1">G. Ahmed</persName> replied that
                        they had hoped not to use the PL-480 proceeds for the Plan, but to conserve
                        them for supplies and programs which would reach the common man and have a
                        more immediate public impact than the larger Plan projects.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SM1">Shoaib</persName> inquired if it
                        might not be possible to decide on a date for the resumed meeting. He
                        remarked that it would not be desirable to have such a meeting coincide with
                        a visit of President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to
                        Washington in early November, and it was accordingly agreed to try to
                        arrange a meeting for late October.</p>

                            >Galbraith</persName> emphasized the desirability of maintaining and
                        strengthening the generally pro-Western orientation of India's military
                        leaders. We understand that the Ambassador will be in Washington this week
                        and hope that you plan to discuss this subject with him.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense is concerned over indications of a trend in the
                        Indian Ministry of Defense counter to the pro-Western orientation of India's
                        senior military officers. These disturbing indications include: the recent
                        Soviet emergence as a supplier of military type aircraft to India, a seeming
                        preference on the part of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KM1">V.K. Krishna
                            Menon</persName> for Soviet rather than American sources of supply of
                        such equipment, and the manipulations of senior officer assignments in favor
                        of politically minded officers within the Indian Army and Air Force by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> which may undermine the
                        present strong, Western-oriented military leadership in favor of those more
                        amenable to his personal political thinking.</p>
                    <p>We believe that this trend should be halted and that early practical steps
                        should be taken to prevent further Soviet inroads which could lead to the
                        exclusion of the United States as a supplier of military equipment to this
                        country.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0084"/>
                    <p>Since private American business cannot be expected to meet Soviet price
                        competition it is necessary to agree upon procedures by which the United
                        States Government can assume a part of the cost of supplying military
                        equipment. It would also be desirable for us to offer long term loans at low
                        interest rates and accept rupees in payment where necessary. There is
                        legislative authority under the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, for
                        making such arrangements. Similar arrangements have been made with Burma and
                        Indonesia. Once it is decided that aid to India should be granted in the
                        United States' interest, the Presidential determinations and waivers which
                        would be required under the Act should be sought. Because the actual prices
                        charged by American manufacturers would not be affected, we can, as an
                        internal matter, view the United States Government's participation in the
                        sales arrangements as an aid to India. There would then appear to be no
                        difficulty with the legal position. Once this is clear, such problems as
                        demonstrations of American manufactured equipment could be worked out. It is
                        recognized, of course, that any arrangements made must take account of
                        Indian sensitivity associated with their firm policy of accepting no grant
                        military assistance.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the security of classified material which might be involved in
                        such sales, Defense recognizes both the provisions of the National
                        Disclosure Policy with its requirement for an in-country survey and the
                        undesirability of special arrangements or exceptions. We believe that the
                        best approach to the security problem would be through our Ambassador's
                        efforts to persuade the Government of India of our firm position and good
                        faith.</p>
                    <p>It is recognized that problems may arise over Indian requests for equipment
                        which we have not yet made available to our allies in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>,
                        and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. We believe that such problems,
                        as is particularly the case with the C-130 transport aircraft, must be
                        handled on a case by case basis.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense proposes that early representations be made to the
                        Government of India which would make it clear that the United States is
                        prepared to offer military equipment on terms at least as favorable as those
                        offered by any other source of supply. We further propose that State and
                        Defense collaborate in the formulation of positive courses of action with a
                        view to implementation soon after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"

                    <p>3122. As President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> bound to raise
                        Kashmir issue in Washington, Embassy believes it timely to assess the
                        prevailing climate and situation here in order to assist Department in
                        reaching conclusions as to what lies within realm of the possible and
                        therefore what course of action to pursue.</p>
                    <p>We perceive no flexibility in <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        rationalization of its position on Kashmir which has probably been
                        reinforced by similar situation in respect of Chinese in Ladakh, i.e.: It is
                        held there can be no disputing India's claims which rest on sound legal and
                        political basis; if other party does not accept India's claim and desires
                        peaceful political settlement, this can only be achieved when military
                        occupation vacated and ties of friendship have begun to reknit; in any case,
                        initiative and proposals for settlement must come from those who seek to
                        repair damage done by infringement on India's territory. Thus, those Indians
                        who have hoped for Indo-Pakistan rapprochement have concentrated on soluble
                        problems with view to strengthening the climate and habit of cooperation on
                        the theory that accommodation of positions on Kashmir, involving give and
                        take, can more easily be justified to Indian electorate if it is among
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>From this standpoint, Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations have
                        to be considerably transformed before Kashmir problem can be tackled. Well
                        informed non-Indian observers, with whom this matter has been discussed
                        recently, do not consider any profitable step on Kashmir can be taken at
                        this time, not only because of current state of Indo-Pak relations but also
                        because it is an election year in India.</p>
                    <p>It is extremely doubtful Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName>, in the unlikely event he desired to, could gain
                        parliamentary approval under present circumstances of any solution of
                        Kashmir issue that would be acceptable to Pakistan. It must be remembered he
                        is regarded by orthodox Hindus as too pro-Muslim.</p>
                    <p>These considerations, together with fact that what <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        says even in confidence to Pakistan leaders seems to leak to press are
                        probably why Prime Minister has greeted President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s conversational overtures on Kashmir
                        with “wall of silence.”</p>
                    <p>Given present state of Indo-US relations, however, and obvious justification
                        for new administration to have current reading of Indian views <pb n="60"
                            xml:id="pg_60" facs="0086"/>from authoritative source, Ambassador plans
                        at a propitious and hopefully early date to discuss Indo-Pak relations with
                        Prime Minister including Kashmir. Obviously no point should be made of this
                        in advance.</p>
                    <p>If, as is generally believed, Prime Minister is found to consider that
                        Kashmir is more a result than the cause of Indo-Pak troubles, which are
                        basically due to the communalism that produced partition, then current
                        period of renewed communal tension is likely to find
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, concerned as he is about communalism, unable
                        to envisage any satisfactory solution and consequently unyielding in his
                        public posture. But at least we shall perhaps be in a better position to
                        gauge what course of action, if any, is open at this time to well wishers of
                        both Pakistan and India.</p>

                        that time he has grappled energetically with three fundamental problems: (a)
                        how to give his government constitutional legitimacy and to make it more
                        representative in character, and at the same time to infuse a spirit of
                        national unity into his regionally-minded people; (b) how to encourage
                        economic development in his resource-poor country; and (c) how to promote
                        Pakistan's foreign policy interests in a complex and changing international
                        scene.</p>

                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s personal authority in
                        Pakistan is not under effective challenge. Despite some jealousies and
                        dissensions among his top military and civilian advisers, he has managed to
                        keep close control over them, to make them work effectively, and to retain
                        their personal loyalty. The prestige of the army, on which Ayub's base of
                        power rests, remains high. (The army withdrew from the day-to-day affairs of
                        government after the first few months.) <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> continues to enjoy wide support among the civil and
                        military services generally. The old line politicians whom he displaced have
                        been intimidated, their party organizations shattered, and many of them have
                        been personally discredited by disclosure of their dishonest and inefficient
                        conduct while in office. Some important politicians, however, may have won a
                        degree of sympathy due to the government's moves against them; the Islamic
                        zealots (Jamaat-i-Islami), the “Red Shirts” (Pushtun nationalists), and the
                        underground Communist Party have retained at least a potential for organized
                        opposition to the regime.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has attempted to bring to
                        Pakistan a greater sense of cohesion and national entity than it has had
                        since its very early days. He himself and most of his advisers are less
                        affected by regional biases than many of their politician predecessors. By
                        removing regional issues from the forefront of politics, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has brought a period of stability and
                        increasing centralization in which more effective national planning has been
                        possible. He has not, of course, been able to eliminate the fundamental
                        political and economic problems which arise out of the country's division
                        into two parts or the very deep cultural and linguistic divisions between
                        East and West Pakistan and within the latter. Indeed, in some cases his firm
                        policy of centralization may have enhanced regional loyalties—especially in
                        the North-West Frontier area. As far as the bulk of the people are
                        concerned, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s benevolent
                        authoritarianism has not been particularly repressive. Although he still has
                        fairly wide, albeit mostly passive, support in the country at large,
                        significant elements still resent the fact that he is not a constitutionally
                        legitimate and representative leader.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s greatest weakness has been
                        his lack of confidence and support from many of the politically-conscious
                        elements in the country. These range all the way from impoverished students
                        and petty trade unionists <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0088"/>to
                        successful professional people and influential intellectuals. Most of these
                        groups resent their virtual exclusion from the governing process by
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Many believe deeply in the
                        ideal of the rule of law and have been associated with the parliamentary
                        system. They are unlikely to be satisfied with any limited representative
                        forms, such as the “Basic Democracies” scheme, which <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> is now implementing.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d29fn1">The “Basic Democracies” are a series of representative
                            bodies beginning at the village level. Except at the village level,
                            election is indirect and some members are appointed by the government.
                            No party organizations are involved. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Though unorganized, their discontent has recently been
                        manifested in student disturbances in Karachi and the locally famous
                        “Snelson Case” in which the judiciary strongly repudiated what it construed
                        as an effort by the executive to interfere in the traditional
                        responsibilities of the courts.</p>
                    <p>5. We believe <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> will continue to
                        dominate the Pakistani scene for the next few years at least—although
                        promulgation of a new constitution and full implementation of the “Basic
                        Democracies” will change the forms through which his power is exercised and
                        probably limit its extent. We anticipate that his regime will continue to be
                        relatively honest and efficient, that he will be able to handle any
                        dissension that develops among his advisers, and that his rule will not
                        become unduly repressive. The period of constitution-making and elections
                        (vaguely promised for 1962) will be a troublesome one, the more so the
                        longer it is. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> is
                        unlikely to win the trust and cooperation of most of the
                        politically-conscious elements or to do more than make a start at weakening
                        basic provincial antagonisms. However, he will probably continue to have a
                        fairly broad base of primarily passive support.</p>
                    <p>6. The longerterm outlook is less clear. If <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> is to consolidate his reforms and sustain their
                        momentum, he will sooner or later have to broaden participation in the
                        government and probably also provide some form of legitimate expression for
                        regional feelings. We believe there is about an even chance that a workable
                        form of limited representative government will evolve out of his
                        constitutional experimenting.</p>
                    <p>7. However, it is going to be difficult for <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> to share power. He is inclined by training and
                        tradition to have little patience with civilian politicians and
                        parliamentary government. He is still vigorous and relatively young (54); if
                        he chose, he could probably go on for some time resting his power on his
                        influence over the military forces and the lack of any satisfactory
                        alternative to his own rule. In such a case, discontent would grow,
                        narrowing the base of his support, and he would probably become more
                        vulnerable to a coup by some other military leader or group—perhaps in
                        alliance with particular civilian or regional interests. Should <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> be killed or incapacitated, he would
                        probably be succeeded by one of his senior military colleagues (perhaps
                        General Azam, theGovernor <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0089"/>of East
                        Pakistan). In these circumstances, the problem of maintaining governmental
                        stability would become still more complicated.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Development Problem</hi></p>
                    <p>8. At the core of Pakistan's development problem are the country's limited
                        resources. Much of the land is desert, mountains, and jungle. Some useful
                        minerals have been discovered, but with the exception of natural gas, their
                        exploitation has lagged. The large population (93 million) is generally
                        unskilled with a high percentage of illiteracy. The living standard is as
                        low as that in any major country in Asia. Until recently, economic
                        development has had a low priority and relatively little has been done to
                        mobilize such resources as are available. The military force imposes a
                        substantial burden on the country. Pakistan does, however, have two
                        valuable, if not always dependable, cash crops (cotton and jute) and the
                        potential at least for a substantial increase in agricultural
                        production.</p>
                    <p>9. The President has selected honest and competent advisers in the economic
                        field. He has restricted unnecessary imports, encouraged exports, and
                        remedied the worst inequities of the land tenure and taxation systems
                        without changing their basic structure. Fiscal policies have been reasonably
                        successful in stimulating industrial production while restraining excessive
                        inflationary pressures. Sympathetic economic policies and political
                        stability have encouraged the private sector of the economy, and private as
                        well as public industrial investment has risen significantly in the past two
                        years. These developments have provided a tenable, though by no means solid,
                        base for Pakistan's Second Five-Year Plan (1960-1965).</p>
                    <p>10. In general, the new plan appears to be sound, although in its present
                        form it may tend to emphasize unduly long-term basic development programs at
                        the expense of useful short-term projects with more direct impact on the
                        economy. The plan calls for total investment in the neighborhood of $5
                        billion and is intended to achieve an increase of about 20 percent in
                        national income and about 10 percent in per capita income. Recent
                        indications that the rate of population growth may be somewhat greater
                        (about 2.2 percent annually) than was previously believed may shave the
                        latter figure somewhat. Nevertheless, successful implementation of the plan
                        would make possible a modest increase in the standard of living, though
                        mainly in West Pakistan. This may prevent for the next few years at least
                        the economic pressures on the political structure from becoming
                        significantly stronger. It would also provide a broadened base for future
                        economic development and encourage greater public interest and participation
                        in the development process.</p>
                    <p>11. Execution of the plan, however, is dependent not only on the mobilization
                        of domestic resources but on the receipt of large-scale foreign aid; an
                        estimated $2.3 billion in aid (not including <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss> 480 surplus <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0090"/>food
                        grain imports) will be required for the 1960-1965 period, or about double
                        the annual rate of recent years.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">Approximately
                            $1.8 billion is required for specific projects in the plan and $500
                            million for imports necessary to keep the economy operating at a
                            reasonably high level. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> This
                        foreign aid is more likely to be forthcoming if domestic planning and
                        mobilization of resources are handled effectively. If the pace of
                        development is to be maintained beyond the plan period, substantial aid will
                        need to continue, as it will be many years before the Pakistani economy is
                        self-generating even under the best of domestic conditions. Thus President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> will continue almost
                        indefinitely to be in the unpleasant position of being responsible for an
                        economic development program the success or failure of which will be
                        determined by external factors over which he can at best exert only limited
                        influence.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">International Position</hi></p>
                    <p>12. The need for external assistance looms large in <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s approach to foreign policy. He has
                        made it clear that Pakistan relies for a major portion of its required aid,
                        economic as well as military, on the US, that as an ally it should have a
                        special right to such aid, and that the aid it has received to date has not
                        fulfilled its expectations. At the same time, he has permitted his
                        aggressive Minister of Fuel, Power, and Natural Resources, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Z.A. Bhutto</persName>, to arrange for a $30 million
                        oil exploration assistance project with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and is now investigating the possibility of Soviet help in
                        dealing with Pakistan's serious water-logging and salinity problem.</p>
                    <p>13. Pakistan's foreign policy problems are not just a question of obtaining
                        external assistance, however. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                        government is under considerable pressure from the Communist Bloc. The
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has long been frank about its
                        hostility toward Pakistan's alliance with the West, and since the U-2
                        incident Pakistanis have been acutely aware of the threat of Soviet power.
                        (The plane took off from Peshawar.) Soviet pressure has also been manifested
                        in the growing Soviet presence in Afghanistan with which Pakistan is prone
                        to connect the increasing unrest on its border with Afghanistan. In
                        addition, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has openly supported
                        India and Afghanistan against Pakistan on the Kashmir and “Pushtoonistan”
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>14. These issues are of themselves of immediate and highly emotional concern
                        to Pakistan and there is a growing sense of concern over failure to cope
                        with them adequately. The “strong” policy toward Afghanistan which the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> government adopted when it
                        came to office has in fact increased Afghan intransigence and intensified
                        unrest on the North-West Frontier. The cooperative policy toward India did
                        facilitate a settlement of the Indus waters question, but it did not lead
                        India to take <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0091"/>up <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s offer for a joint defense effort in
                        South Asia, and most importantly, it failed to achieve any progress on
                        Kashmir. Pakistan's membership in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> has not brought from the US the
                        support on regional issues for which Pakistan hoped, nor have <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s several trips abroad won any new
                        support from the neutrals. Indeed, many Pakistanis fear that the US desire
                        to maintain amicable relations with Afghanistan and to support strongly a
                        major economic development effort in India are manifestations of an
                        increasing partiality toward the “uncommitted” nations. A resulting
                        frustration has tended to increase the existing neutralist sentiment within
                        the country. On the other hand, a sense of growing crisis over external
                        issues tends to increase national unity.</p>
                    <p>15. In this situation, more complex than any Pakistan has faced in the
                        international field for some years, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s foreign policy is likely to seek greater independence
                        within the framework of its pro-Western orientation. Additional technical
                        and economic agreements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are
                        possible, as are more comprehensive negotiations with Communist China on
                        Himalayan border questions. Pakistan has already indicated its intention to
                        favor Communist China's membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>;
                        other shifts on emotional Afro-Asian issues and the establishment of closer
                        ties with Tito and Nasser may follow. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s vigorous policy on the “Pushtoonistan” issue will
                        probably continue. In addition, he will try to focus international attention
                        on the Kashmir problem again, perhaps even by provocations or agitation in
                        the disputed area.</p>
                    <p>16. Pakistan's relations with the US will probably continue to be judged to a
                        considerable degree in the light of US relations with India and Afghanistan.
                        There are likely to be fairly persistent expressions of dissatisfaction with
                        US aid and repeated requests for demonstrations of US confidence and
                        support. In this atmosphere, the possibility will remain that foreign policy
                        problems, especially if they are coupled with unfavorable internal
                        developments, could seriously erode Pakistan's close association with the
                        US.</p>
                    <p>17. We believe this to be unlikely, however, at least for some time to come.
                        Pakistan is firmly committed to the pro-Western alignment implicit in its
                            <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> memberships, and short of a radical change in government
                        it would be difficult for it to find a congenial place among the neutralist
                        nations. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and many
                        Pakistanis have a genuine fear of communism. Moreover, Pakistan is heavily
                        dependent on the US for both military and economic aid, and, despite
                        occasional recriminations and manifestations of greater independence,
                        Pakistan will probably continue to place its basic reliance on the West and
                        to cooperate actively with it within the established framework of the
                        alliance. Indeed, a major effort to demonstrate Pakistan's loyalty and to
                        win increased US support and commitments will almost certainly be made
                        during <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s visit to the US in July
                        1961.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> opened by expressing
                        a warm welcome to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> on
                        his arrival in the United States.<note n="1" xml:id="d30fn1">President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> arrived in Washington on
                            July 11 and returned to Pakistan from New York on July 18. He spent the
                            first 3 days in Washington and was Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s guest during a 2-day trip to
                            the LBJ Ranch in Texas.</note> Vice President Johnson and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s sister had taken great
                        pleasure in seeing President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> in
                        Pakistan. We had greatly appreciated his sturdy support of <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>'s Plan 5 at a most dangerous period.
                        Now we wanted to give him our thinking and to get his views on subjects of
                        common interest. For all these reasons, we were glad he could come in July
                        rather than waiting until November. Another reason was that some of the
                        Congressmen who have been least enthusiastic about the American aid program
                        were particularly friendly to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s country, and when they heard him tell the advantages
                        of the aid program, perhaps they would see it in a better light.</p>
                    <p>Observing that in these talks the two presidents could begin anywhere,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> started with his
                        recent visit to Vienna. In 1914, in 1939, and in Korea troubles had arisen
                        in part because there were many misunderstandings. To avoid miscalculation
                        based on misunderstanding, he had wanted to get to know Khrushchev, whose
                        January 6 speech had sounded as if it could lead only to war. He had wanted
                        to know what was really meant. Unfortunately he got little enough
                        satisfaction out of the talks. Khrushchev was courteous, but made it very
                        clear he intended to follow the course he had set out.</p>
                    <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>On Laos, Khrushchev had said the right words about neutrality, but the
                        President had come away unclear as to what meaning he attached to them. On
                        nuclear testing they got nowhere. On Berlin Khrushchev had said what he had
                        since stated publicly, that he expected to sign a peace treaty, then
                        announce that both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Western
                        Powers had thereby lost sovereignty in the area. If this were done, East
                        Germany might or might not take action immediately. All in all, we were
                        faced with a difficult situation, which could end in disaster. We might have
                        to strengthen our military establishment. The extra $4-5 billion would hurt
                        us in the foreign aid field and in other activities although we would do it
                        if necessary. One of our problems was that we did not have as large forces
                        as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and had relied on nuclear
                        weapons as a deterrent. Thus the situation had the dangerous capability of
                        escalating rapidly. We would hope Khrushchev would give way, and we supposed
                        Khrushchev hoped we should.</p>
                    <p>On the question of Laos, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> said that in March, when it appeared the Pathet Lao
                        might capture Vientiane, he had gone to see Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>. We had heard that the British
                        would not intervene, nor would the French. <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName> agreed to a limited plan, but the French would
                        not. Then came talk of a cease-fire, and we were faced with a new situation.
                        We had just been through the Cuban episode—which was a mistake, at least in
                        implementation—and he had taken a fresh look at the U.S. military situation.
                        There was the problem of getting troops into Laos, which had no seaport. The
                        U.S. concluded that it might be difficult to go in. Viet-Nam was another
                        country that troubled President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> knew that it was easier to get into these situations
                        than out of them. In many ways this was one of our most anxious problems,
                        because we should not want to make a mistake which would leave us fighting
                        in an Asian situation where we could not win without using nuclear weapons
                        and forfeiting the support of peoples of Asia.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded with general
                        comments about conditions in Southeast Asia. Much of the problem, he said,
                        arose because most of the rulers were princes and others wanting mainly to
                        protect their own interests. Unless they were prepared to identify
                        themselves with their own people, no amount of aid would save them. If the
                        U.S. wanted to help them, it should insist that they undertake reforms. It
                        should also be prepared to take active leadership of local armed forces,
                        including use of weapons, training, and operations. To President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s comment that the U.S. did not
                        even put Southeast Asian soldiers into uniform, President <hi rend="italic"
                            >Ayub</hi> agreed that there were many problems. The French would not
                        fight in Southeast Asia, he thought, nor had the British now much interest
                        in the area. Would it not be better, therefore, to detach the French and the
                        British from SEATO? It would give more flexibility. <pb n="68"
                            xml:id="pg_68" facs="0094"/>Pakistan had been asked to prepare to send a
                        battalion to Laos, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        said, but he had concluded a battalion could do nothing but get itself lost.
                        He had decided therefore that it would be better to send a brigade group so
                        it could fight well as a more integrated group.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then turned to
                        Pakistan's security situation. Displaying a map showing Pakistani
                        information on the deployment of Indian forces, he said that of one-half
                        million troops in the Indian army, 15 per cent were deployed against China
                        and 85 per cent faced Pakistan. Displaying a second map on which Afghan
                        military formations were indicated, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> referred to an Afghan army of 80,000 to 90,000 men on
                        paper but said he didn't know how effective they were. The Russians had
                        poured in $450,000,000 worth of military equipment, though perhaps the
                        Afghans could not yet use the equipment effectively. The Pakistan Army, he
                        added, showing a third map, was necessarily deployed against India and
                        Afghanistan. That was why he kept harping on the Kashmir question. Until it
                        was settled, the armies would face one another. Should the Afghans get
                        properly trained, moreover, Pakistan would be up the gum tree if an attack
                        came from either India or Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> believed the Indians
                        are not going to march. They already had what they wanted in Kashmir. To
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> the point was that
                        India wanted to neutralize all Pakistan. In answer to President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s question how that would help
                        India, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that it
                        was clear from the Indian Army deployments that they regarded Pakistan as
                        enemy no. 1. To them the Chinese problem was just an aberration, a
                        misunderstanding. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        observed he could understand India's desire, especially
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s, to hold on to what they had in Kashmir. He
                        could also understand India's force being placed there to keep out Pakistan,
                        which had irredentist feeling. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> responded that Kashmir was a test; if India should
                        settle with Pakistan on Kashmir, it would mean India wanted to live at peace
                        with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained that the
                        U.S. had supported India not with the expectation that India would support
                        U.S. policies, but because we felt it in the interest of us all that India
                        should not collapse. He perceived difficulties in dealing with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, who had been around a long time, and he did
                        not know what the U.S. could do. We could not even bring Chiang Kai-shek,
                        whom we had helped more than anyone, to do what we saw was in his own
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that what the
                        U.S. wanted in South Asia was an area of stability. He wouldn't say that the
                        U.S. should threaten to withhold aid to India, but surely the U.S. had the
                        right to demand responsible action from <persName>Nehru</persName>.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> acknowledged that the
                        U.S. wanted to do good and to assist India in order that it should not go
                            <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0095"/>Communist, but at the back of its
                        mind the U.S. surely thought India would support the U.S. To the contrary,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained, he did
                        not expect <persName>Nehru</persName>'s support on the items that were vital
                        to the U.S. The U.S. had supported the Indian Consortium even when Nehru was
                        strongly attacking U.S. actions in Cuba. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> agreed that <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        would not support the U.S.; he wanted to keep open his channels to Moscow,
                        also.</p>
                    <p>One clue to the understanding of India in President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s opinion, could be found in the
                        peculiar patterns in underdeveloped countries wherein central governments
                        collected funds which were then spent in the states. Since demands were
                        always greater than the funds, wrangling resulted of which the Communists
                        could take advantage. Regional wrangling had already started in India for
                        this reason and because of other divisions such as caste, with the result
                        that local regionalisms were growing stronger. So far
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s personality and the unity obtained in the
                        fight against the British had held India together, but these could not carry
                        on indefinitely. Meanwhile the Chinese Communists had an army of one-half
                        million troops in Tibet ostensibly to control a population of two million.
                        Actually these troops were not too far from Calcutta, which was the base of
                        Communism in India. In his view India was bound to break up in 15 to 20
                        years. If it were said that the key to the defense of the rim of Asia was
                        India, he would add in these circumstances that the key to the defense of
                        the subcontinent was Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> wondered what his
                        guest would feel <persName>Nehru</persName> could agree to in the Kashmir
                        dispute that Pakistan would also agree to. Describing on the map their
                        respective locations, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        replied that <persName>Nehru</persName> had shown no disposition to yield
                        anything beyond the cease-fire line in Kashmir. Pakistan would have no
                        objection to India's taking Jammu. To protect its resources Pakistan would
                        have to have some miles on the other side of the River Chenab. But he didn't
                        wish to come down to details now; only to point out the necessity of the two
                        nations coming to negotiate. Pakistan's people were getting fed up. This is
                        why they sometimes talked of working more closely with China, though they
                        didn't want China to come in. What then did Pakistan want of China,
                        President Kennedy wondered. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> wanted nothing of China; he'd like to see it go to
                        hell. But the Pakistani people were anxious to do something about
                        Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> could understand why
                        a settlement was important, but didn't know whether the U.S. could influence
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. In President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s opinion, however, <persName>Nehru</persName> now had
                        to come to the U.S. He had no maneuverability left. The Chinese did not like
                        him, so he had to turn to the U.S. Why could the U.S. not see that?
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> felt the U.S. to be
                        not all that influential with <persName>Nehru</persName> on Kashmir. It was
                        a bone-deep issue. Even so, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> felt that the U.S. need merely <pb n="70"
                            xml:id="pg_70" facs="0096"/>tell <persName>Nehru</persName> it was
                        concerned about the waste of its money that occurred because the Kashmir
                        issue was not settled. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> still believed one should not underestimate the
                        strength of feeling about such issues. He recognized, for example, that
                        Pakistan could not understand why the U.S. should feel so strongly about the
                        admission of Communist China to the U.N., but it did. He supposed that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had the same kind of feeling about Kashmir.
                        Even if this were true, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> commented, many people of India did not agree with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. They would like to get outstanding issues
                        settled. When a number of boundary issues had been settled, many people were
                        joyful. Looking ahead strategically, the U.S. should remember that anything
                        it gave was wasted until the Kashmir issue was solved. Summing up this part
                        of the discussion, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        wanted President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to understand
                        that (1) the U.S. gave aid to India not to get that country's support but to
                        help it stay free; (2) it was in the vital interest of the United States
                        that this issue be solved; and (3) when <persName>Nehru</persName> came to
                        Washington in November President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> would make a major effort with him. He wanted
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to know that even if
                        he did not succeed, he would have tried. Unless this effort succeeded,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> believed that Pakistan
                        would have to bring the case again to the U.N. Would the U.S. then support
                        Pakistan? Yes, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        said, the U.S. would support the U.N. resolutions. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thanked him for this statement.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether there was
                        any chance for a broader consideration of the problem. Could the Kashmir
                        issue be put into the context of the security of the entire subcontinent,
                        for example? Expressing doubt, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> described Kashmir as the manifestation of India's
                        hostility toward Pakistan. No government of Pakistan, he added, could stand
                        by dealing with other problems while ignoring Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that if the
                        U.S. was to be involved in the Kashmir case again, Pakistan should at least
                        wait (to raise the question in the U.N.) until after he had seen
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. If after that, Pakistan finally decided to
                        bring the question to the U.N., the U.S. would vote with Pakistan. (Comment:
                        In later discussion with Messrs. Rountree and Talbot, the President made it
                        clear that at the proper time the U.S. should appraise the possible
                        consequences of renewed consideration of the Kashmir question in the U.N.,
                        and should counsel the Pakistanis strongly if the prospects were negative.
                        End comment) President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> noted
                        that the past U.S. position on Kashmir in the U.N. was known, and that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> could use this
                        record in his talks with <persName>Nehru</persName>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed that in the communique of the
                        present meetings, it would be important to emphasize the past record, not
                        talk of the future.</p>
                    <p>Saying he also wished to talk about Afghanistan, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> recalled that during all the time
                        Afghanistan had served as a buffer between Russia and Britain (British
                        India) it had never had good roads. <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0097"
                        />Now three excellent road systems being built in Afghanistan by the
                        Russians would enable the Russians to bring 9 to 12 divisions to bear on
                        Pakistan if they wanted to. The U.S. was obligingly building lateral roads
                        for them. When this complex was completed, the Russians would be in a
                        position to intimidate Pakistan militarily. Their goal was to intimidate
                        Pakistan and to knock it out of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. To reduce this pressure was one
                        reason that Pakistan made its oil deal with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> believed our ability to
                        act in Southeast Asia to be now completely curtailed. Because they were a
                        liability, he felt the protocol countries should be detached from <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> reminded him that in Viet-Nam the U.S. had taken on
                        almost unilateral responsibility. Yes, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> responded, and now the U.S. was getting somewhere. The
                        Communists were creeping in all the time, so nothing but direct action could
                        stop them. He doubted that Thailand would last long. As the U.S. was giving
                        the Thai equipment it should ask them to give it the controls so the
                        soldiers would fight.</p>
                    <p>In President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s judgment the
                        threat posed by the Soviet Union was not overt war in that region. If it
                        wanted war, it would attack the U.S. He would think the threat that Pakistan
                        might confront in Afghanistan was the possibility of guerrilla warfare and
                        Communist party control. The question was the strength of the border forces
                        in Afghanistan and of the Communist Party influence in both Afghanistan and
                        Pakistan. Things along the border went on, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded. There were attacks in the
                        area, and Pakistan hit back hard. The Afghans believed the Russians would
                        prevail. They wanted to get all the support they could from them, but at the
                        same time to keep them at arm's length. They did this by getting U.S.
                        support. Yet the Royal Family in Afghanistan did not want to commit suicide.
                        The U.S. could therefore tell the Afghans it would give aid when their
                        actions justify it. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        wondered whether it was then President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s opinion that the U.S. should not want to give aid to
                        Afghanistan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> had
                        taken another view—that the Afghans should not be allowed to be smothered,
                        and that the U.S. should give them support. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> felt nevertheless that if the U.S.
                        wanted Afghanistan to behave, it should pull back a bit. Answering President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s observation that at
                        least Afghanistan was not yet a satellite, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> suggested this was true because the
                        Soviets didn't want it yet. In essence he felt Afghanistan was a satellite;
                        the Royal Family was no longer free. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> did not yet have the Communist Party cells in Afghanistan
                        to take over.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> thought the United States
                        should endeavor to place the Afghans in a position of seeking our aid. If
                        the United States did not give assistance so freely, the Afghans would come
                        to realize the danger of losing it altogether, and this they did not
                        want.</p>
                    <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0098"/>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that no
                        amount of American aid would make a country want to preserve its
                        independence. Unless there was a will and determination in this regard,
                        assistance rendered was wasted. We should therefore always consider the
                        attitude of the government toward independence as a criterion in determining
                        aid uses. He mentioned Guinea as a country in which the determination of the
                        leaders to preserve their national independence seemed in doubt, and
                        therefore a country in which the utility of American aid was also
                        doubtful.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> commented that Sekou
                        Toure was a Communist. However, he might be replaced by someone else who
                        would pursue other policies. The difficulty in Afghanistan was that in
                        present circumstances the rule was confined to only one family.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> mentioned the
                        problem of judgment involved in such matters. For example, the extension of
                        aid to Yugoslavia had lessened Yugoslav dependence upon the Soviet Union and
                        had helped to bring about a greater degree of independence. There were other
                        such places where we should use economic assistance to avoid, in effect,
                        turning the country over to the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said many countries
                        were exploiting American anxiety to help them. This was particularly true in
                        Afghanistan. If, however, the Royal Family should feel itself in danger of
                        losing American aid and thus of increased reliance upon the Soviet Union,
                        their attitude might change. If the United States should pull back a bit
                        they would feel naked and might become more sensible in their foreign
                        relations. He thought in any event it would do no harm to try this tactic.
                        Certainly Pakistan did not want to suggest any course which would increase
                        the danger of the Communists taking over in Afghanistan. Their interests
                        were exactly to the contrary and it was the President's belief that the
                        “shock treatment” would be more successful than the course currently
                        followed by the United States.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said the Pakistanis
                        might have an exaggerated idea of the magnitude of American aid to
                        Afghanistan. The program now was quite limited—we had spent only $22 million
                        in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 and $165 million in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951-60—and he felt we could not withdraw
                        completely without running a real danger.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> commented that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had observed at Bangkok that
                        the United States was sometimes thought of as a cow with milk but with no
                        horns. He thought we should develop a few horns and become a bit tougher in
                        dispensing aid.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> referred to the
                        matter of Pakistan's using U.S. equipment on the Pakistani border against
                        Afghan tribal incursions. Recalling that some had thought the situation
                        similar to that in Algeria, where we had come in for criticism because the
                        French had used U.S. equipment, he said that here the situation was
                        different. We had no objection <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0099"/>to
                        Pakistan's using U.S. equipment to protect its national security if it felt
                        action vital; it was a question of how best to get into position to settle
                        differences with Afghanistan. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> said that military equipment was not the sort of thing
                        one used unless there was need. Pakistan had no intention of attacking the
                        Afghans. But if they came at Pakistan, it would hit them hard.</p>
                    <p>Explaining Pakistan's reactions to U.S. policies, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that whenever the U.S. had a
                        success anywhere, Pakistan shared in the success. When the U.S. suffered
                        reverses, Pakistani morale went down. U.S. power was the only cover
                        available to Pakistan and other countries. Thus it was not that Pakistan was
                        criticizing U.S. policies, but that if any policy failed, there were
                        repercussions on Pakistan's security. Sometimes a firm stand was necessary.
                        The Russians, for example, used to play a trick on Pakistan. They would give
                        Pakistan very short notice of overflights of their planes to Delhi, and then
                        take unauthorized routes. Finally he had had to tell them that if they again
                        took an unauthorized route, their plane would be shot down. That worked.
                        Pakistan faced that sort of thing quite often. It was living in the midst of
                        tricksters—Russians, Chinese, and those bloody Hindus.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> pointed out that if
                        the U.S. were not involved all around the world it could easily maintain
                        military control in limited areas, say the Caribbean. By the same token, so
                        could the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over areas near its
                        territory. If the Americans seemed less assertive in some areas, it didn't
                        mean we were fainthearted. But while chances remained in Afghanistan, we'd
                        like to be in a position to move forward with them.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the subject of Indo-Pakistan relations, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> repeated Pakistan's desire to settle
                        the disputes. He sometimes wondered what sort of statesmanship
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had. He had been neither impressed nor
                        inspired by <persName>Nehru</persName>, who could not see what a fatal
                        mistake he was making in not seizing the chance to settle the disputes.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked about
                        transportation arrangements across India between the two wings of Pakistan.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> explained that after having
                        agreed to permit transit of some trains each week,
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> found some objections in his Parliament and
                        as a result India had now made clear this would not be implemented—even
                        though Pakistan had permitted Indian trains to cross parts of East Pakistan
                        between Bengal and Assam.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> spoke of having hoped
                        that things would ease up, but this was the sort of people they were. These
                        chaps had no intention of fighting China, either. They were spending $700
                        million on armed forces, shoving the money down the drain. He couldn't
                        understand why they should continue doing so, instead of settling the
                        disputes. But he found Indians a very trigger-happy people. In 1951 they had
                        got on the move, for no apparent reason. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> went on to say that there was a <pb
                            n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0100"/>great deal of concern in Pakistan
                        over the spreading scope of American military aid. His people wanted to know
                        whether there was any intention to give India more arms aid.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> replied that there
                        was no intention to give India any arms aid.</p>
                    <p>If this should happen, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        continued, the Pakistani people would force his country out of the pacts and
                        alliances and everything.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained that when
                        in the new aid bill changes were made in the political qualifications that
                        countries must meet to be eligible for American military assistance, India
                        was not even discussed. If sometime a situation, such as impending war with
                        China, should arise that would cause the Indians to come to the U.S. for
                        military aid, we would talk with Pakistan and see what was the best course
                        of action. However, there was no intention now to give India military aid.
                        If there should be a change in U.S. policy, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would talk with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> first.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> was worried mainly about the
                        public relations angle. Indian newspapers had carried these stories of
                        change in the American law and had suggested India might get U.S. military
                        aid, and Pakistani newspapers had picked them up. As a result, the Pakistani
                        people had become alarmed. The Pakistan Government could not repudiate the
                        story, and if there were no repudiation on this end, people would think the
                        story true.</p>
                    <p>To President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> the best course
                        seemed to be to try to let the issue pass. It would be wrong to issue a
                        statement. We would get into a fight about something that was not a fact.
                        The best thing therefore was just to let the whole thing pass. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> agreed that that would be best, but
                        felt the people of Pakistan would not let it pass. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> suggested that all should think
                        about what to do about this in the common interest.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> concluded the meeting
                        by repeating that he found it a great pleasure to see President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He wanted him please to remember
                        that Pakistan genuinely regards him as a friend.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2"

                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> continued their discussions on
                            July 12 and July 13. The conversation on July 12 dealt largely with
                            economic issues. The conversation on July 13 opened with a discussion of
                            the question of Chinese representation in the United Nations before
                            turning to the issues of economic and military assistance for Pakistan.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had an additional
                            discussion of military assistance with Johnson on July 15 during the
                            flight to Texas. Memoranda of the two conversations with <persName

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMH1">Maiwandwal</persName> gave a long,
                        historical account of Afghan and Pushtun occupancy of various areas east of
                        the Durand Line and of British determination for several generations to keep
                        Afghanistan a backward buffer state. He said that when the British
                        established the Durand Line in 1893 they knew that it cut through the land
                        of the Pushtuns. Before Britain left India in 1947 it promised that on its
                        departure the Pushtuns east of the Durand Line would have freedom to
                        determine their future. However, after a referendum which was boycotted by
                        the Pushtun nationalist leader, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Pakistan claimed it
                        had the sanction to incorporate the Pushtun areas into the new Pakistani
                        state. Afghanistan does not want these areas for itself but Afghans do feel
                        that their Pushtun brothers must have a chance to determine their own
                        destiny.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the Ambassador's statement the President called for a map.
                        When it came and the President asked the Ambassador what area he was talking
                        about, the Ambassador swept his hand over nearly half of West Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Of late, the Ambassador said, Pakistan has been taunting the Pushtuns with
                        American arms. In response to the President's question, the Ambassador
                        confirmed that he was still talking about the areas east of the Durand Line.
                        These actions greatly disturbed Afghans and reemphasized the problem
                        confronting Afghanistan when the United States gives Pakistan sophisticated
                        weapons. The President commented that he had heard that Afghanistan had
                        weapons from the Soviet Union. Agreeing that this was true, the Ambassador
                        said that Afghanistan had turned to the Soviet Union only after the U.S. had
                        given weapons to Pakistan and after Afghan requests for arms from the United
                        States and other Western countries had been refused. He added that the
                        Afghan military and economic <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"
                        />relations with the Soviet Union did not mean that Afghanistan was
                        pro-Communist or pro-Russian. If the Pakistanis complained that Afghan roads
                        would enable Soviet forces to reach the Pakistan frontier with ease, their
                        reply would be that they would get there over the dead bodies of the
                        Afghans.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked for a definition of the U.S. policy toward use of
                        American-provided military equipment in the border areas. At the President's
                        request Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> explained that the
                        bilateral Pakistan-U.S. Agreement permits the use of <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> equipment for internal security purposes and that since the
                        U.S. recognizes the Durand Line as Pakistan's frontier there can be no legal
                        objection to Pakistan's use of this equipment to meet vital internal
                        security needs in that area. However, this did not mean that the United
                        States could not counsel Pakistan against such uses as might exacerbate
                        relations between Pakistan and its neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that disputes among nations that are friends of ours
                        create difficult problems for the United States. Obviously we cannot settle
                        all of these disputes. We do hope, however, that the parties can find
                        peaceful solutions to them.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the United States continues to desire friendly
                        relations with Afghanistan. We had been able to help Afghanistan to some
                        limited extent in its economic development programs and he hoped we could do
                        more. He asked the Ambassador to come and see him again when the Ambassador
                        returns to Washington.</p>

                        serious threat to India; c) there are no present plans for increasing this
                        number. If it is useful, you might note that one factor in decision to
                        supply F-104's was to counter incursion of advanced-type aircraft over
                        Pakistan from north. <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0106"/>You may also
                        wish to re-emphasize that it is threat from north which has from beginning
                        been and continues to be basic motivation for US military aid program in

                            added, however, that the United States did not want to encourage an arms

                    <p>During my four days in New Delhi I saw <persName>Nehru</persName> on three
                        occasions: once in his office with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>, that same night at a small dinner at his home
                        with Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, Ambassador and Mrs.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>, Mrs. Indira Gandhi,
                        and Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>; and,
                        finally, at a small dinner given by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> the night before we left for home.</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0107"/>
                    <p>On all three occasions the Prime Minister was in excellent spirits. It was
                        clear that his relations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> were more than normally cordial and that he has
                        already developed great respect for the Ambassador's judgment not only on
                        foreign policy questions but also on matters of India's economic
                        development. This relationship will be invaluable to us in the future.</p>
                    <p>As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> has
                        undoubtedly reported, our first visit dealt largely with Berlin but also
                        touched on a variety of other subjects.</p>
                    <p>I underscored the vital importance we attach to the right of the people of
                        Berlin to self-determination and our concern over the willingness of the
                        Soviets to provoke a crisis on this issue. I stressed that the Russians had
                        been considerably more threatening in private than in public and described
                        two difficult personal meetings with Menshikov, whom <hi rend="italic"
                            >Nehru</hi> knows as a former <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        ambassador to India whom he dislikes.</p>
                    <p>I expressed surprise that the Indians showed so little public interest in
                        Berlin. <persName>Nehru</persName> suggested that this was partially due to
                        a sense of fatalism in that the decisions rested with the great powers over
                        whom India could exercise but little influence and partly because the
                        situation was geographically remote as well as complex.</p>
                    <p>I expressed the view that two quite different dangers flowed from the Berlin
                        situation: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Through a miscalculation in Moscow we might stumble into a nuclear
                                war.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The likely intensification of the Cold War growing out of a
                                prolonged Berlin conflict would have implications both for U.S. and
                                Soviet policy all over the world, with destructive results for
                                everyone concerned.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I suggested that the difficulties which Khrushchev faced in central Europe
                        stemmed in large measure from the utter failure of the East German
                        government under Ulbricht.</p>
                    <p>Khrushchev has repeatedly asked for a peaceful competition between two
                        economic systems, a competition in which he has assured the world the
                        Communists would eventually triumph. Actually such a competition had been in
                        effect between the two zones of Germany for the last fifteen years and
                        anyone who has visited these knows that the Communists have suffered a
                        disastrous defeat. Right now 5,000 of their ablest people are fleeing the
                        socialist “paradise” of East Germany each week to live in the capitalist
                        Western zone.</p>
                    <p>I believe we were able to convince <persName>Nehru</persName> of our
                        determination not to be pushed out of Berlin, that the struggle there is for
                        self-determination of the people of Berlin and not purely to assure our
                        legal rights, that if we should abandon our commitment the implications
                        would become global and that India would be deeply affected and finally that
                        while standing firm on the Berlin question itself, we were willing to
                        negotiate <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0108"/>in good faith on the many
                        open questions which involve U.S. and Soviet interests in Central Europe and
                        throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>We then touched on a variety of subjects including a discussion of African
                        problems, particularly Angola, the progress India has made since my last
                        visit, etc.</p>
                    <p>That evening after dinner I talked with <persName>Nehru</persName> alone for
                        forty minutes in his living room. This conversation turned immediately to
                        the question of China. The following points emerged from this
                        discussion.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item><p><persName>Nehru</persName> stated that China was in an arrogant
                                mood and the greater her internal difficulties the greater her
                                arrogance was likely to become. He described with considerable
                                bitterness Peking's refusal to negotiate the border question in
                                spite of the fact that Chinese forces had pushed 150 miles within
                                Indian territory. As in my talk with him last September in New York
                                he referred with considerable awe to Mao Tse-tung's boast that China
                                could absorb 300 million casualties in a nuclear war and still
                                survive as a nation.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, <persName>Nehru</persName> felt as did U Nu that the
                                Chinese Communists were unlikely to provoke a war in Mao's lifetime.
                                They would press forward wherever possible, but it was unlikely that
                                they would undertake any massive military moves.</p></item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item><p>We discussed for several minutes the crucial differences between
                                the Chinese and the Indian agricultural problems. With roughly
                                double the arable land per family, India is producing only half as
                                much per acre. This means that China has far less elbow room in
                                which to expand her food production than India.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, as a free nation India is able to secure food in large
                                quantities from abroad through <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                                480 or by direct purchase. China, on the other hand, is inhibited
                                not only by the lack of foreign exchange but also by her reluctance
                                to become dependent on capitalist wheat and powdered
                            milk.</p></item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item><p>I suggested that during the coming years the U.S. might be faced
                                with a critical choice between two courses of action:</p>
                            <p>If the climate permitted: <list>
                                    <label>A.</label>
                                    <item>We could relieve the Chinese agricultural shortages by
                                        making food available in considerable amounts. Although this
                                        would relieve much of the pressure on the Chinese economy it
                                        would also help assure the success of the Communist
                                        industrial program.</item>
                                    <label>B.</label>
                                    <item>We could deny the Chinese such food supplies on the gamble
                                        that acute and continuing shortages might bring about the
                                        collapse of the Peking regime. If this gamble failed, we
                                        could expect a massive movement into Southeast Asia to seize
                                        control of rich, relatively underpopulated areas from which
                                        China's food deficit could largely be met.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>After pondering these alternatives at some length,
                                    <persName>Nehru</persName> while admitting that the question was
                                a difficult one said that on balance the <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83"
                                    facs="0109"/>wisest course of action would be to help China to
                                close its food gap, if the Peking government gave us the opportunity
                                to do so, in return for an agreement not to indulge in either overt
                                or covert acts of aggression against their neighbors. Although such
                                an agreement might not be adhered to, it offered whatever hope there
                                might be for a greater measure of stability.</p></item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I then said that although he did not believe the Chinese Communists
                            would move militarily under present circumstances, the possibility of
                            such a move in the next ten years could not be denied. Although India
                            and America might be unable to cooperate fully in planning to cope with
                            such a possibility, we should at least be able to discuss the subject in
                            confidence and to understand each other's limitations and
                            potentials.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I assured him that if China sought to expand into South or Southeast Asia by
                        military power we would oppose this effort with whatever allies we could
                        persuade to cooperate with us. At least we could count on the Australians,
                        New Zealanders, British, Canadians and those Asians under direct attack.</p>
                    <p>However, in Southeast Asia the military advantages we had in the Korean war,
                        where we were fighting on a narrow front with a strong and powerful base at
                        our rear, were lacking. Moreover, it would be wishful thinking to assume
                        that the Chinese would limit their attack to a force which we could block
                        with our readily available resources.</p>
                    <p>If, as we must assume, the Chinese should bring their full military resources
                        to bear, we would be forced to choose among using all our available weapons,
                        including nuclear power, an ignominious defeat, or withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>I stressed that it was important that this situation be clearly understood
                        not only by India but by Japan and other Asian nations so that they could
                        calculate their own most effective course of action.</p>
                    <p>The only other long range hope of controlling Chinese pressure that I could
                        see was through the development of an indigenous Asian power balance which
                        would depend only indirectly on the United States military. Such a balance,
                        as I had suggested to him on other occasions, could be provided over the
                        long haul only by India, Pakistan and Japan.</p>
                    <p>I agreed that it was no more possible for the Indians and the Japanese under
                        the present circumstances to accept a formal alliance with us than it would
                        have been for the United States to accept the alliance with the British
                        which Lord Canning proposed in 1823 at the time of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I recognized the almost insurmountable problems that grew out of
                        India's differences with Pakistan, India's reluctance to expand her military
                        commitments beyond Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"
                            facs="0110"/>possibly Burma, the built-in pacifism of many Japanese, and
                        the restrictions of the Japanese constitution.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the subject was critically important, the threat was great and
                        likely to grow, and it seemed to me essential that he carefully consider its
                        implications.</p>
                    <p>I stressed that we were keenly sensitive to his own difficulties and those of
                        other neutral states in Asia and that we had no desire to embarrass him or
                        them publicly or in any other way. Nevertheless, there were certain hard
                        facts which must be faced and I hoped in future years that progress could be
                        made in developing the necessary Asian power balance which would enable U.S.
                        military forces to remain more unobtrusively in the background.</p>
                    <p>I added that I had covered this subject in detail with U Nu who said he would
                        discuss it further with <persName>Nehru</persName> in Belgrade.</p>
                    <p>5. I asked <persName>Nehru</persName> about Chinese progress in Tibet. He
                        replied that he had mixed reports, but that he was inclined to feel that the
                        Chinese hold had been pretty well established, that the Khamba revolt had
                        largely been suppressed, (although sporadic fighting continued in some
                        areas) and that there had been some relaxation in regard to the Chinese
                        control of the monasteries.</p>
                    <p>He said the Chinese had built a network of roads which had greatly improved
                        their military position. Nevertheless, he doubted that the Chinese would
                        attempt to break through in this area. If this should occur, he felt that
                        the Indians and the Pakistani (who regardless of present differences would
                        be forced into some degree of cooperation) could provide formidable
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>The much greater danger, he agreed, came from the East. On India's northeast
                        frontier a well developed line had been created with heavily guarded check
                        points at relatively frequent intervals.</p>
                    <p>After dinner the following evening, a similar exchange began with the
                        Belgrade conference. <persName>Nehru</persName> told me that he had not
                        wanted to go, but had felt that if he and a few others failed to attend the
                        conference would be taken over by “extremists.” He questioned me about Tito
                        and seemed hopeful, although by no means confident, that he might help
                        provide a moderating force, particularly in regard to Berlin.</p>
                    <p>I suggested relative to the Belgrade conference that we were now witnessing a
                        unique development in foreign affairs, the dim beginnings of what might be
                        called a world conscience. Evidence of this could be seen in the reluctance
                        of the nuclear powers to embark on further tests in the atmosphere which
                        would create fall-out over large areas of the earth. I added that while many
                        Americans often disagreed with him, it was felt that he had contributed more
                        than any other individual to the development of this new power of world
                        opinion.</p>
                    <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0111"/>
                    <p>I then suggested that the conference in Belgrade would indicate the extent to
                        which this new force could bring effective pressure to bear on a given
                        situation. For instance, certain kinds of resolutions would further increase
                        the present tension, create bitterness in the United States, and strengthen
                        the elements which are most opposed to a rational, responsive American
                        foreign policy in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand if a majority of the conference members showed a sober
                        awareness of the complexities of the problems we face, those forces in the
                        Western world which were constructively working to create partnership with
                        the peoples of the under-developed areas would be greatly strengthened.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName>Nehru</persName> was noncommittal as to specifics, he
                        appeared interested in this line of discussion.</p>
                    <p>I then congratulated <persName>Nehru</persName> on the crucial role India had
                        played in regard to the United Nations. In the Congo following Lumumba's
                        death there had been a rush by several nations to withdraw their troops and
                        indeed many were actually being pulled out. If this trend had continued, the
                        whole United Nations effort in the Congo would have collapsed.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> retrieved the situation, however, by his
                        offer to send 4,500 additional Indians.</p>
                    <p>History may record this act as the crucial turning point in our efforts to
                        build the United Nations into a positive instrument for world stability. The
                        importance of what he had done was now demonstrated by the marked
                        improvement in the Congo situation which would have been impossible without
                        Nehru's timely assistance.</p>
                    <p>As <persName>Nehru</persName> rose to leave he remarked that he had never
                        been to Latin America, that he was considering a very brief visit there
                        following his trip to Washington, and did I have any suggestions.</p>
                    <p>I replied that a visit could be most helpful but that Latin America was big
                        and complicated and a visit to one country such as Brazil would bring heavy
                        pressures to visit others. The most practical way out if his time was really
                        limited would be to fly from Washington to Mexico City and spend a few days
                        there. This would give him something of the flavor of Latin America with a
                        minimum of complications.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, he could then return to India via Japan, where he might find it
                        profitable to discuss India's and Japan's common interest in creating a more
                        favorable Asian power balance.</p>
                    <p>He smiled and remarked that no one could charge us with lack of perseverance,
                        since I had been pressing this same point ever since we first met in
                        1951.</p>

                        <persName>Nehru</persName> seemed in excellent spirits, confident, ready and
                        anxious to exchange confidences, very favorably inclined toward the <pb

                        concerned that we would again become so absorbed in Europe that Asia would
                        receive less attention.</p>
                    <p>I had assumed that the question of Pakistan-India relations would come up
                        naturally. But it was not mentioned, and I did not think it wise to
                        introduce the explosive question of Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>In discussing our efforts to persuade the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> to agree to a nuclear test ban and our concern that the

                            <persName>Nehru</persName> expressed surprise and even disbelief that

                    <p>127. In conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>,
                            <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> officials from Prince <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> on down raised question future of
                        American foreign aid to Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> himself made no special plea
                        except on timing of the American decision. He said that <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> could not press US for assistance, as
                        obviously this purely American decision which we would have to make,
                        weighing all factors involved. He stressed the need for an early answer,
                        regardless of whether affirmative or negative, so that their planning
                        process could be complete.</p>
                    <p>Prince <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> was far more explicit. He
                        described at some length his feeling that entire future of country depended
                        on outcome this question. He said that <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>
                        simply could not stop development. On other hand the dangers of excessive
                        dependence upon <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, particularly as it
                        was neighboring state, were fully realized. He felt that far more than
                        development alone was at stake, as in some ways their whole social structure
                        could eventually be changed by over-dependence upon Russia. He said he saw
                        little hope for the future except through assistance from US and <pb n="87"
                            xml:id="pg_87" facs="0113"/>West Germany. He described German assistance
                        as very welcome and now very important but looked upon US assistance as far
                        more important for obvious political reasons. He dwelled upon importance of
                        some type of long term assurance, giving example of difficulties caused in
                        past by short term arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Abdul Hai Aziz, as was to be expected, was even more emphatic, sometimes
                        emotionally so, of the vital necessity of future US assistance, and critical
                        time element involved.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> explained philosophy of new
                        administration and present status legislative process. He explored as deeply
                        as time would permit important questions such as extent of their self-help,
                        limitations imposed by local currency, local skills, et cetera. He told
                        officials he aware of problem prior to his departure from Washington and
                        would study it intensively during his stay here. He said he realized and
                        appreciated keen interest of <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> on this
                        question and hoped it would be possible reach decision in Washington in the

                        was more forthcoming on dangers of over-dependence on Russia than ever
                        before to me. This perhaps logical in connection with argument for future US
                        aid commitments. I believe it somewhat more than that, however, in view of
                        recent indications from many sources that <gloss target="#t_RGA1"

                        contemplates that we may have to go next to a public statement deploring the

                        with the Paks; they have long disagreed with our mediatory efforts, feeling
                        they know how to deal with Afghans better than we do, i.e. be tough. (Which
                        we fear will just drive them further into the bear's embrace.) The hell of

                        just now coming around to realize what we've been telling them for
                        years—that they're dangerously close to becoming Soviet prisoners—and that
                        we may have a new opportunity, with skillfully applied economic baksheesh,
                        to keep them from becoming completely dependent upon Moscow.</p>

                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> of our offer on Sept. 2. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> expressed “sincere
                        gratitude” for your interest and your willingness to be of assistance, and
                        said he hoped you understood fully the reasons for closing the consulates
                        and his feeling that the consequences of this action need not have been the
                        Afghan decision to terminate diplomatic relations. While recognizing the
                        fundamental difference of opinion between the Government of Pakistan and the
                        U.S. as to the best means of dealing with Afghanistan, he went to some
                        lengths to justify his policy of dealing firmly with the Afghans. He said he
                        had no objection to our telling the Afghans that Pakistan did not seek a
                        break in diplomatic relations, nor had it any intention of setting aside the
                        transit agreement. He said his Government was prepared to work out
                        appropriate arrangements to keep traffic moving, but did not agree that we
                        should suggest to the Afghans the possibility of re-opening the
                        consulates.</p>
                    <p>Upon receipt of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>'s
                        report, the Department authorized Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName> to inform the King (in the absence of Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>) of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s willingness to work out transit
                        arrangements and to suggest that, in response to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s gesture, the Afghans at least postpone their deadline
                        for termination of diplomatic relations. In his reply to this instruction,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> expressed the
                        opinion that the suggestion to postpone the deadline would be regarded as a
                        request for unilateral action on the part of the Afghans and would have an
                        adverse effect if it were proposed to the King. He suggested that he be
                        authorized to inform Prince <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s willingness to work out
                        arrangements to continue the transit agreement, and to convey to <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> our offer of good offices—which he
                        apparently had not done previously. In a cable sent last night, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> was authorized to talk to
                        Prince <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> along these lines.</p>
                    <p>I believe further action on our part should await a report on Ambassador <hi
                            rend="italic">Byroade</hi>'s talk with <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName>. Factors contributing to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s cocky attitude are his apparent belief that if the
                        Afghans are treated roughly they will come to heel (despite possible Soviet
                        backing), and his realization that we are eager to maintain certain
                        facilities in Pakistan. Many Afghans apparently believe we are conniving
                        with the Pakistanis, but continue to exploit our interest in keeping
                        Afghanistan neutral—in the hope of obtaining increasing aid from us.</p>
                    <p>As of today diplomatic relations between the two countries have, for all
                        practical purposes, been terminated.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">On September
                            6, Pakistan and Afghanistan broke relations and closed their respective
                            Embassies in Kabul and Karachi. (Telegram 164 from Kabul, September 7;

                        doubt that a Presidential <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0118"/>message
                        could have the effect of preventing the break in relations generated by the
                        Afghan note. The desirability of such a message might well be considered
                        when it appears that the President's personal representatives in Kabul and
                        Karachi have had an opportunity to make the maximum possible use of the
                        current offer of good offices.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> began by mentioning the
                        fact that two days earlier Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName> had discussed the Pakistan-Afghanistan problem with
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> and this
                        morning had called upon Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName>. The United States was particularly interested in the
                        continued flow of traffic into Afghanistan. If the border remained closed
                        for any length of time most of our programs in Afghanistan would come to a
                        halt because of a shortage of supplies including asphalt and motor fuels.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> pointed out that our aid
                        to Pakistan had been significant because Pakistan had a well-planned program
                        for economic development. He said it was our understanding that Afghanistan
                        has just completed its development plan and that the planners were hopeful
                        that about one-half of the foreign exchange requirements would come from the
                        West. If the door to the outside world were slammed shut, the Afghans would
                        have to turn to the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> said the Soviets will use
                        the struggle between Pakistan and Afghanistan for their own ends, which
                        could easily bring the Red Army to the Pakistan border and thus jeopardize
                        the whole region of <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0119"/>South and
                        Southeast Asia. The Red Army had been an important factor in contributing to
                        the effectiveness of Communist control as witnessed by the fact that
                        Communism had made little progress in areas where it was not assisted by
                        military strength. The Communists had lost ground in Africa, in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and in Iraq, and were able to maintain
                        their position in East Germany, Hungary, and Poland only with the assistance
                        of the Red Army. <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> replied
                        that his Government was aware of the Soviet threat to South Asia and had
                        mentioned this fact several times in the past but the State Department had
                        not agreed. He said he was referring to the previous Administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> said that in thinking of
                        various possibilities for Afghan windows on the outside world it had
                        occurred to him that it might be worth reviving the idea of a route from
                        Kabul through Iran to the sea involving the construction of a road as well
                        as a port. Such a facility might be rented on a 99-year lease.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> said that such an idea
                        suggested that Pakistan had stopped the traffic, which was not true. Also,
                        such a route would shift the problem from one trade route to another but
                        would not solve the real problem, “Paktoonistan.” He asked if there were a
                        historical precedent for such a leasing arrangement. In reply the Suez Canal
                        was suggested.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> said that if this impasse
                        continues for another thirty days we may be in trouble. He then asked if the
                        trade offices might be reopened. <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz
                            Ahmed</persName> said that he did not see how this would solve the
                        problem unless the required personnel were permitted to operate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> reiterated that he was
                        trying to visualize a mechanism for solving the transit problem and if a
                        likely solution could be found he would be willing to discuss it with
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> provided there were a chance
                        of success and provided the Pakistanis were agreeable.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> remarked that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was a Pathan; he understood
                        the Pathan mind and he understood the thinking of the Royal Family in
                        Afghanistan. He was of the conviction that the only effective means of
                        dealing with the Afghans was by following a tough line. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> suggested that if the United
                        States held back, and gave the Afghans time to cool off, the Afghans would
                        be more likely to take steps to solve their problems. He thought that if
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> said to <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>, “If there is anything we can do,
                        please let us know,” this would be the most effective way to encourage the
                        Afghans to solve the transit problem.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> said that he did not believe
                        the Afghans would walk into a Russian trap. Likewise, he thought it unlikely
                        that the Afghans would substitute free world trade routes for Soviet
                        transport. He said if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName> has given <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName> the impression that the State Department is disturbed
                        by the transit problem, such an impression would give the Afghans confidence
                        to take a strong line with both the <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0120"
                        />Pakistanis and the United States. Then, he thought, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> in talks with Americans would try to
                        exaggerate the seriousness of this situation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> wondered whether we had any
                        information on the degree of support the people of Afghanistan were giving
                        the Government on this problem. He thought <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName> was the person taking the strong line and that the King
                        and <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> probably were not supporting
                        it fully.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> said that on this question
                        we were all guessing, but that one thing certain in his mind—the Soviets
                        were going to make the most of this situation, and would develop this
                        opportunity into a diversion action to their probable losses in the Berlin
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> asked if the Ambassador
                        could think of a mechanism that would permit the transit traffic to flow
                        into Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> said that he would ask his
                        Government for its suggestions, adding that he would also like to ask the
                        State Department to ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName> for his suggestions as well.</p>

                            After expressing concern for developing situation, <persName

                            but it would mean that, if Afghan did not now cut itself off from sea,
                            there was hope of being able to look forward to alternate lifeline in

                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>Also I said that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> had
                            expressed to me his hope that further aid assurances might be given to
                            Afghan if our present lifeline of supply not cut. I explained carefully
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> that I was not giving him
                            at this stage formal assurances by US Government, but rather the
                            intention of <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> to start
                            working on these things if we could make arrangements to keep things
                            going in interim.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> said he much appreciated what he
                        had been told. Even though he understood informal nature of what I had
                        relayed he would consider it carefully and discuss with Cabinet. He said,
                        however, even though what I had said of great importance, he afraid
                        Washington did not quite understand problem. Daily movement of goods, even
                        though extremely important, was not as important as cause of tension between
                        Afghan and Pakistan, which had resulted in present situation. Grateful
                        though he was for our present efforts, he wished we could devote equal
                        energy to core of problem itself. He said “the Pakistanis think that if they
                        are given free hand they can settle Pushtunistan problem by force. As
                        sincere friend of US I wish tell you that if Pakistanis are proceeding on
                        this basis this is greatest mistake you can imagine, and if they persevere
                        in this policy it is certain to cause disaster for whole area.” He went on
                        to say that world apparently knows very little about Pushtunistan problem
                        while it sometimes seemed to him that concerted effort was made to keep veil
                        of silence on it. World opinion knew nothing of Afghan side this issue. What
                        little was known all came unilaterally from Pakistan side. Said in his own
                        view <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> had never asked anything
                        inconsistent with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or US principles. He
                        referred to Kennedy's statements on self-determination. He said Afghans had
                        always looked to US as country which had greatest desire to protect weaker
                        countries in freedom and important principles such as right of
                        self-determination. He did not feel <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>
                        position unreasonable. Pakistanis say Pushtun tribes happy under Pakistan
                        domination. <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> maintains they are not. All
                        he asks is that Pushtuns be given chance express their honest view. If it
                        were proved that <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0122"/>Pushtuns wished to
                        be under Pakistan rule, he would give me his word of honor that <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> would abide willingly by their
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Under circumstances did not wish give appearance no consideration would be
                        given <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>'s views. On other hand did
                        not feel could remain silent. Therefore general discussion followed with
                        effort on my part make him understand difficulty his position from US point
                        of view, along lines general principle self-determination one thing, but US
                        support to one of its friends attempting apply principle inside territory of
                        another was quite another. Also made reference, as had to <persName

                        to indicate a real indigenous independence movement.</p>

                        consulates and trade agencies. He must be concerned Pakistanis will, as
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> Wali predicted, occupy

                        but there no doubt in my mind that if they do, <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName> will fight with everything he has, regardless of

                        not. He would of course be welcomed here. Seems to me key factor to consider
                        is what assurances for future he could get from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> under these circumstances, and whether these could be
                        in form which <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> would believe,
                        even if he could secure them.</p>

                            of purchasing military equipment on a qualitatively comparable basis to

                        <item>Most importantly, certain senior members of the Indian military have
                            made informal and unsolicited approaches to representatives of the U.S.
                            Department of Defense with specific proposals for circumventing what
                            they consider to be the negative policies of Defense Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> toward the purchase of U.S.
                            equipment. In general, they appear to be willing to move for closer ties
                            with the United States and consider it essential that some means be
                            found whereby India could purchase U.S. equipment at prices competitive
                            with those offered by Russia. Specifically, an Indian general officer
                            currently in this country for medical treatment has advised that he will
                            contact the Indian Ambassador in Washington to persuade him to take this
                            matter up with the Prime Minister in connection with his forthcoming
                            visit. In effect, the desire and interest of the Indian military is to
                            bring about, if possible, a high level discussion of this subject
                            between President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>You will appreciate the extreme sensitivity of these conversations, the
                        details of which and the names of the individuals concerned are known to you
                        and are therefore not mentioned in this correspondence.</p>
                    <p>Our understanding, at the time of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s last visit, was that the next move was his. It
                        was made clear to him that any sales whatever of classified material to
                        India (this would include Sidewinder notably) would necessarily entail some
                        form of SD/MICC over-all check on Indian security practices; and that any
                        sale on favorable terms which would require an element of grant aid would
                        have to be revealed to the Congress (through the medium of a Presidential
                        Determination) and <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0124"/>would also
                        inevitably become known in India so that it could not be represented for
                        other than what it was. The Ambassador realized that these two problems
                        would pose extremely serious obstacles from the Indian standpoint, and so
                        far as we are aware, he has not indicated that they can be surmounted, or
                        even that the chances are sufficiently likely for us to warrant making the
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>On the question of SD/MICC requirements, this is a matter on which the
                        Department of State has the leading role. We cannot, I should suppose, adopt
                        any policy toward India that is inconsistent with our over-all policy on
                        these clearances. The essential point is that we have insisted on them in
                        the past for our close allies so that it is most difficult to relax in the
                        case of nations not allied to us. However, the more limited problem of
                        releasing classified equipment should not be allowed to block the
                        formulation of a general policy for some form of subsidized sales to India,
                        the advantages of which would be substantial.</p>
                    <p>Despite recognized problems, the Department of Defense continues to recommend
                        that a U.S. Government position be established whereby military equipment
                        may be offered to the Indian Government on monetary terms at least as
                        favorable as those offered by any other source of supply. It appears most
                        urgent that a firm position be established on this in consultation with
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> and well in
                        advance of Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s visit; and that such a proposal

                    <p>State believes that the time has come to bring your prestige to bear in the
                        potentially dangerous Afghanistan-Pakistan dispute, initially by a <pb

                            >Naim</persName>'s visit to Moscow lends new urgency to this move.</p>
                    <p>I have certain reservations as to the wisdom of engaging you personally in
                        repeating a plea for the Afghans to reopen transit trade which <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> made successively to <persName

                            >Daud</persName>, with turndowns from both. However, I defer to the
                        State experts who feel that the chief impact to be sought at this juncture
                        is the fact of your intervention itself, and that we should avoid premature
                        revealing of any further moves we contemplate. Your letter would also serve
                        as a peg for a presentation by <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName>.</p>
                    <p>State's intent is to start a dialogue. They feel <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Zahir</persName> will reply in effect that they want to reopen transit
                        but cannot do so unless the Pakistanis reopen trade agencies, etc. Then
                        State hopes you could write <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>,
                        telling him of the Afghans' reply and urging him to do so. (Meanwhile, we
                        are informing <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> of your personal
                        concern over the crisis and the letter to <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"

                    <p>I recommend that you approve State's draft, but bear in mind that quite a
                        [lot of] correspondence may be required if our “good offices” are to
                        succeed. Both sides are playing for our intervention on their behalf.
                        Neither is willing to give as yet, so the thankless job of suggesting a way
                        out and selling it will probably be ours.</p>
                    <p>State feels the sooner we get the letter out the better, so request immediate
                        approval.</p>

                                agreement of May 29, 1958, was an historic achievement. <gloss

                            >In telegram 213 from Kabul, September 18, the Embassy proposed three
                            amendments to the letter, to prevent it from having a “deleterious
                            rather than benefical effect.” (Ibid., 689.90D/9-1861) The Department
                            accepted two of the proposed amendments, as noted in footnotes 2-3
                            below. It did not approve a revision of the last sentence in the third
                            paragraph to make reference to exploring possible additional transit
                            routes. Such a change, the Department concluded, might have the effect
                            of raising false hopes. (Telegram 116 to Kabul, September 18;

                            <p>“September 17, 1961. Your Majesty: I cannot but be deeply concerned
                                over the break in diplomatic relations which has resulted from the
                                recent exchange of notes between Your Majesty's Government and the
                                Government of Pakistan. As a friend I am distressed to know that
                                Your Majesty's efforts to bring the fruits of progress and freedom
                                to your people may be seriously curtailed, and that the United
                                States efforts to be of assistance may be severely hampered.</p>
                            <p>While I realize that a variety of factors is involved in the present
                                tensions between the Royal Government of Afghanistan and the
                                Government of Pakistan, I wish to take the liberty of expressing the
                                view that if the normal flow of traffic between Afghanistan and
                                Pakistan were to be resumed under the existing transit agreement, an
                                immediate source of tensions might be removed. As Prime Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> and Prince <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> have been informed by
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, we have
                                received assurances from the Pakistan authorities of their desire to
                                maintain the flow of traffic to and from Afghanistan under the
                                transit agreement. This to me is an element of hope.</p>
                            <p>As Your Majesty knows, the shipment of equipment and materials
                                through Pakistan is essential to the continuation of United States
                                aid projects in Afghanistan and to the planning of future
                                    projects.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">The first sentence of this
                                    paragraph was changed to read: “As Your Majesty knows, vast
                                    quantities of equipment and materials essential to the
                                    continuation of US aid projects in Afghanistan have been and are
                                    being shipped to Pakistan.”</note> I therefore venture to
                                inquire whether Your Majesty will be willing to take steps to permit
                                the resumption of shipments from Pakistan to Afghanistan.<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d45fn3">The last clause of this sentence was changed to
                                    read: “to take steps to permit the movement of these shipments
                                    through Pakistan to Afghanistan.”</note> It is my understanding
                                that this can be accomplished if Your Majesty's Government adopts
                                measures to provide incoming vehicles with the necessary
                                documentation. In this connection I should like to reaffirm the
                                offer of good offices made to Your Majesty's Government through
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>, and to
                                underline my desire to provide practical assistance in working out
                                the transit problem.</p>
                            <p>I earnestly hope that Your Majesty will take steps to continue the
                                operation of the transit agreement—a move which I would hope might
                                pave the way for improvement in relations between Your Majesty's
                                Government and the Government of Pakistan. This would be in keeping
                                with the call being made to many of us in these critical days to
                                resolve differences through patience, negotiation and peaceful
                                purpose.</p>
                            <p>Please be assured, Your Majesty, of my deepest personal interest in
                                the solution of this problem and in the well-being of the Afghan
                                people.</p>

                                Previous experience—e.g. 1955—shows Afghans for reasons of pride are
                                fully capable of falling into the Soviet trap. We will strongly

                        situation. Had thought that perhaps he not fully informed these practical
                        matters but it became apparent he was quite up-to-date.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty said his reply would be preliminary as he wished study carefully
                        text of President's letter before formal reply. He had one general thought
                        however wished give me right away. He wanted express his appreciation for
                        good intentions our President. This motivation on part our President was
                        apparent not only in this crisis but in many others around world. He hoped I
                        would express his appreciation for this sign personal interest of
                        President.</p>
                    <p>He hoped President would understand that, in view present state of high
                        feelings and emotions arising out of strained relations with Pakistan,
                        practical aspects of movement of goods which we naturally considered so
                        important. [sic]</p>
                    <p>King said he regretted that we could not be effective in compelling
                        moderation on part of Pakistanis. Said this not only because recent Pakistan
                        actions had been aimed at damage to Afghan, but because he thought policies
                        of present military government of Pakistan would prove unbeneficial, not
                        only for this area, but for people of Pakistan themselves. <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> looked upon recent premeditated (he
                        indicated his intelligence quite good on this point) actions of Pakistan as
                        designed divest Afghan of right of transit that existed for so many years.
                        This unilateral act, aimed at what was an inherent right of Afghanistan, was
                        such that they could not close their eyes and go to Pakistanis seeking new
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>King then spoke bitterly of Pakistan decision close, as practical matter,
                        their borders this year to nomadic tribes. This was inhumane act of great
                        importance causing him great anxiety. It gave further proof of real
                        intentions Pakistan and was significant added factor in total picture.</p>
                    <p>King said he had listened carefully to my remarks about their northern
                        neighbor. He had only one thing to say in this regard. The most basic of all
                        national policies of Afghan was to retain independence and Afghan would
                        never sell that independence nor would any amount of pressure ever change
                        that basic policy.</p>
                    <p>King said he would like talk to me as private person and not as King. He
                        asked that I not take notes as his only reason was impress upon me depth of
                        his feeling. He talked at some length on Pushtunistan issue, illustrating
                        with frequent examples distortion he felt we received from general lack of
                        knowledge of area and misinformation given us by Pakistan. The long history
                        of tribal area could not be washed out by imposition of an artificial
                        border. He spoke of an attempted revolution in northern Afghanistan many
                        years ago. <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>, in time of his father, had
                        practically no armed forces at all. Tribal elements from areas across what
                        is now called Durand Line, came at great distances in middle of winter to
                        help Afghanistanis put down this revolt. What was he now to say to <pb
                            n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0132"/>people of Bajaur when they ask for
                        Afghanistan help, and what was he to say to his own bodyguard which
                        contained many sons of tribesmen who had once fought shoulder to shoulder
                        with Afghanistanis? He wished we could take deeper look at what is actually
                        going on. For instance, we probably believed over-simplification by
                        Pakistanis in painting Bacha Gul as Afghan agent. If we really studied
                        history of resistance of Bacha Gul's father against British, and of Bacha
                        Gul's own efforts during years he attempted to work in close cooperation
                        with Pakistanis and the Moslem League in an effort find solution
                        Pushtunistan problem, we would find it a distortion to label him simply an
                        Afghan agent.</p>
                    <p>However, of most importance he considered policies of <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> dangerous in extreme, even to people
                        of Pakistan itself. We should study more deeply what is happening even in
                        areas as accessible to us as Peshawar area. There, people were being beaten
                        by sticks, exiled and thrown into prison in manner almost unbelievable in
                        present age. Effects of this on minds of people even in Pakistan were very
                        unfortunate.</p>
                    <p>King wanted me to know that he personally felt their Pushtunistan policy was
                        right one for Afghanistan to follow. He even felt we would agree in the end,
                        as coming events would undoubtedly remove cover of secrecy over events in
                        that area. Afghanistanis could not compel others to see things as they saw
                        them, just as they could not always see things as others do. Even if
                        Afghanistanis were suffering many losses at the moment this probably not as
                        important in long run as losing a basic principle. However, he wanted me to
                        report that the friendly relations between our countries, which included
                        sentiments of the people themselves, were real; even if Afghanistanis
                        complained to us at present he wanted me to know that this was not an
                        important indication of real feelings of he and his people for America and
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> There nothing particularly new in substance
                        of above. Had not of course expected, nor did I get, any indication of

                            >Daud</persName>. This perhaps designed put to rest any suspicion of
                        exploitable differences between King, <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>. Also
                        was impressed by his apparent sincerity in talking about mistakes Pakistanis
                        are making in tribal areas. In this connection it interesting that British
                        Ambassador told me yesterday that, while complete evidence lacking, he was
                        beginning to feel Pakistanis headed for more trouble on their side of border
                        than they had anticipated. We of course without information on which to form
                        any judgment.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Phil</hi>: Last night I had a long and exceedingly
                        interesting conversation with <persName>Nehru</persName> about the arms aid
                        to Pakistan, non-aggression and, less expectedly, Kashmir. In accordance
                        with our arrangement on communications I am passing this on to you by letter
                        with the understanding that you will inform the Secretary. I don't need to
                        persuade either of you of the importance of holding these matters closely
                        for the time being and I hope I have persuaded the Indians of the need for
                        doing so. I say Indians because I thought it wise to try the subject out
                        first with <persName>Desai</persName>. He provides useful guidance on
                        approach and, since he warns the Prime Minister, one is assured of a more
                        stable reaction there.</p>
                    <p>I began by cautioning <persName>Nehru</persName> on the delicacy of the
                        subject I was about to take up and the fact that were it to become public
                        knowledge in any inconvenient way Washington would be at liberty to dismiss
                        it as purely personal talk. I then said that we were far from satisfied with
                        our present relations with the subcontinent and mentioned my recent talks
                        with the President and Secretary. Our arms aid to Pakistan could doubtless
                        be explained to Indian officialdom. We could not hope to explain it to the
                        Indian public; the arming of the Muslims by the Americans would forever be a
                        fertile breeding ground for anti-American agitation, something which did not
                        please us for its own sake. The most plausible occasion for changing the
                        policy would be a rapprochement between India and Pakistan—a declaration of
                        non-aggression and of their common concern for the defense of the borders of
                        the whole subcontinent. (These were my precise words; one needs to be very
                        cautious about using such military terms as a mutual defense pact.) I added
                        that this was no naive excursion nor were we searching the world for
                        disputes to mediate. We were fully aware of the history and its rich yield
                        of difficulty but our aid involved us inevitably in the problem. So long as
                        things were wrong one should beware of the easy course which is to shut his
                        eyes and say nothing can be accomplished. Finally I asked if there were any
                        way of preventing the discussion from becoming immediately a discussion of
                        Kashmir.</p>
                    <p><persName>Nehru</persName>'s response was warm and sympathetic. He said it
                        would be a mistake to assume that nothing could be done. But he said that as
                        a practical matter, especially from the viewpoint of the Pakistanis, it was
                            <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0134"/>impossible to avoid Kashmir.
                        One cannot think realistically of a settlement which puts aside the major
                        subject of dispute. Then he talked in a relaxed and, indeed, rather amusing
                        fashion of the history of the Kashmir dispute. Nothing, he said, has so
                        taxed his pacifist spirit as sending soldiers into the Valley though he had
                        found considerable moral support in the discovery that Gandhi was agreeable.
                        There was a good deal more detail of this sort including discussion of the
                        military campaign, much of it known, which brought him down to the present
                        Indian position: the ceasefire line presents the only possible settlement.
                        He has people who insist that Azad Kashmir is part of India. The Pakistanis
                        lay their claim on all of Kashmir and Jammu. Neither side can dislodge the
                        other; the only thing is to accept the line as it exists.</p>
                    <p>This, of course, leaves India in possession of the most desirable piece of
                        real estate, namely, the Valley. I asked <persName>Nehru</persName> if he
                        would be averse in the interest of a settlement to giving Pakistan rights in
                        the Valley. I noted that after the Republic of Geneva had joined Switzerland
                        a tributary area had been left in economic union with Switzerland but under
                        the political administration of France and had so remained to this day. If
                        the Valley were to remain under Indian administration, why not give both
                        countries free trade with and population access to the Valley? This would
                        mean that communications could again flow up the traditional route from
                        Rawalpindi and the Muslim population of the Valley would have free
                        intercourse with that of Pakistan. <persName>Nehru</persName> was not
                        specifically averse to the idea. He asked if this would involve some control
                        posts on their roads out of Kashmir to India; I pointed out that the French
                        had them outside of the Zone. He also noted that there would be a danger of
                        a heavy migration from Azad Kashmir and Pakistan to the Valley because of
                        the higher standard of living there. But then he added: “If there were a
                        general settlement we wouldn't have to worry about troublemakers.”</p>
                    <p>After a little discussion of the possibilities of Pakistan acceptance of some
                        such development we left the subject with the observation by the Prime
                        Minister that to settle this problem would remove one of the worst causes of
                        communalism in India. He noted, incidentally, that in his view Hindu
                        communalism was more vehement and troublesome than the Muslim version.</p>
                    <p>I would very much appreciate your reaction to this conversation. You will see
                        that I have moved at least a little in the way of a joint tenancy—hardly a
                        condominium—in the Valley. I left the way open for another talk with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> with a view to firming up our thoughts prior
                        to his trip to Washington and we should consider what might be said in
                        Washington. It will occur to you that the conversation if it accomplished
                        nothing else has substantially eased the way for anything that the President
                        might wish to say on this subject.</p>
                    <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0135"/>
                    <p>Especially I would like your suggestion as to the next step. Much as I like
                        Bill Rountree personally he is not committed to an escape from the military
                        arrangements of which, indeed, he was one of the authors. Therefore, there
                        is no chance that he would be a good avenue of approach to the Paks. It is
                        my view moreover that this should be part of a much larger approach which
                        includes the waterlogging and salinity problems—we say among other things
                        that we are seeking a settlement which eases tensions between the two
                        countries in order to concentrate resources on saving the Punjab. One
                        possibility might be to get Dave Lilienthal, who did a good job on the Indus
                        settlement, to try his hand again on this one. Or perhaps I might ask the
                        President and Secretary to enlarge my charter in the region to see what
                        could be worked out. Of course, if the Laos conference were ever to end

                        Indeed I would rather trust it to him than anyone else. What is needed is
                        someone who is a master of all the ingredients—our military commitment to
                        the Paks, our needs there, the salinity and waterlogging problem, the need
                        of India for a settlement and an imaginative view of the concessions she
                        might make—who could work out a package that both could conceivably buy.</p>

                            <p>“Kabul, September 26, 1961.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency: I sincerely appreciate Your Excellency's expression
                                concern over severance diplomatic relations between my country and
                                Pakistan. But I must herewith clarify this undesirable state affairs
                                brought about solely by Pakistan's unilateral action on basis
                                imaginary pretext. It therefore evident development this unfortunate
                                situation is contrary to policy Afghan Government.</p>
                            <p>Government Afghan convinced transit to and from sea-ports through
                                territory sub-continent, which divided today into India and
                                Pakistan, has been inherent traditional right this country in
                                traditionally accepted form implementation by responsible Afghan
                                offices such as consulates, trade bureaus in different parts
                                area.</p>
                            <p>Government Afghan has always been convinced that right transit and
                                its means implementation is completely apart from any political
                                differences between two countries.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately however, Government Pakistan has continuously
                                interfered in matter, by creating handicaps in application our right
                                and even by having blocked transit, obviously with view bringing
                                political pressure upon this country.</p>
                            <p>Government Afghan does not consider historical indisputable right
                                transit as mere facility or favour accorded Afghan, and any
                                unilateral decision to deny these rights wholly or partially, or to
                                depart from their traditional forms, will be unacceptable to
                                Afghanistan. Otherwise it becomes evident these basic rights are to
                                be left to whims fancies of Pakistan Government.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency fully aware how deeply Government Afghanistan aspires
                                to develop country and bring progress prosperity our people, and how
                                it has made every possible effort attain these aims. Accordingly,
                                government, people Afghan greatly appreciate efforts US help us in
                                development our country and have always tried facilitate
                                implementation your friendly aid for assurance better future for our
                                people.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan's unilateral decision expressed in her note August 23 to
                                close Afghan consulates, trade agencies which existed for no other
                                purpose than the application our transit rights—implementation of
                                which was their recognized accepted duty, has posed fait accompli
                                which Government Afghanistan cannot ignore. We consider this
                                unilateral action of Pakistan Government as blatant and unlawful
                                violation our rights.</p>
                            <p>In note delivered Pakistan 30 August, Afghanistan formally requested
                                reconsideration Pakistan's decision close Afghan consulates, trade
                                agencies.</p>
                            <p>Government Afghanistan reiterates its views that restitution transit
                                possible only when pertinent Afghan offices can render their
                                services normally as of before.</p>
                            <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0137"/>
                            <p>If Government Pakistan persists in its position we have no other
                                alternative than propose to US Government continue her friendly aid
                                to Afghan via Iran, transit goods through Iran being by no means
                                impracticable.</p>
                            <p>Although Government Afghanistan deplores latter development tension
                                in our relations with Pakistan, we confident that this tension
                                created only by Pakistan Government.</p>
                            <p>Government Afghanistan hopes Your Excellency's government, friendly
                                as it is to both parties, will make every possible effort for
                                re-establishment Afghan offices responsible for implementation our
                                transit rights through Pakistan, and thus help return normal
                                conditions and reduce tension between two countries.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency's personal interest in matter will be deeply
                                appreciated and it expected that continued American effort will make
                                it possible to bring situation back to normal.”</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador delivered a letter from King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Zahir</persName> of Afghanistan in response to the President's letter
                        of September 17.<note n="1" xml:id="d50fn1">See <ref target="#d49">Documents
                                49</ref> and <ref target="#d45">45</ref>.</note> He then outlined
                        the Afghan view of the crisis between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Afghanistan
                        believes Pakistan set off the present difficulty by taking advantage of
                        Afghan dependency on the consulates and trade agencies <pb n="112"
                            xml:id="pg_112" facs="0138"/>in Pakistan. The Ambassador admitted that
                        there had been fault on both sides in connection with the activities of
                        consulates, but said that steps had been taken to open discussions with
                        Pakistan with a view to rectifying the situation. Meanwhile, Afghanistan had
                        feared that the <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> visit to the
                        United States would result in a lessening of United States regard for
                        Afghanistan. The Ambassador was in fact in Kabul during August arguing on
                        the basis of reassurances from the President and Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> that there had been no change in
                        United States policy toward Afghanistan. It thus came as a surprise to the
                        Ambassador that Pakistan suddenly levied its demand concerning the
                        consulates and trade agencies. The Ambassador concluded by expressing his
                        gratitude for United States interest in Afghanistan's welfare.</p>
                    <p>The President said he thought King <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Zahir</persName>'s letter was a good one. He promised to see what the
                        United States can do, and concluded by saying that Afghanistan would be
                        hearing from the United States very shortly.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>After a short opening discussion on Canada, I referred to my mission to South
                        Asia. I said that the more I examined the problem the less optimistic I was
                        over the possibilities for an early solution. I spoke of the irreconcilable
                        public positions already adopted by the two governments. <pb n="115"
                            xml:id="pg_115" facs="0141"/>The President agreed that the problem was
                        difficult and complicated. He added that if a solution were soon found, he
                        would be both surprised and pleased.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say that the sole ingredient for success lay in the President's
                        prestige and personal interest since there were obviously no benefits nor
                        sanctions which could be applied or offered to either side with profit.</p>
                    <p>The key appeared to be whether or not there existed with both parties a
                        desire for a solution and I said that I thought this would become apparent
                        quite quickly. Under these circumstances I said that I hoped to restrict my
                        presence in the area to about two weeks and had already laid the ground work
                        for this. To risk cooling my heels for an extended period I felt would be
                        damaging to the President's own prestige and render more difficult the
                        future task of Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName>. The President
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p>Finally I said that whereas there were many ideas produced by the Department
                        for a practical formula to start the trade moving, I believed that I would
                        have to rely principally on our people on the ground for the exact formula
                        or formulas which might work.</p>
                    <p>Finally I said that whereas my bias was naturally in favor of a stout ally, I
                        fully appreciated the strategic importance of a genuinely neutral
                        Afghanistan and hence we could not lightly contemplate abandoning our effort
                        to achieve this objective. The President expressed himself as being in full
                        agreement on both points.</p>
                    <p>As I was about to leave I asked the President whether I could hold out to the
                        King of Afghanistan the possibility of his making an official visit to the
                        United States in 1962, if this appeared to be a necessary inducement to
                        arriving at an agreement on transit trade. The President said he saw no
                        reason why I should not do this but said he would like to check the matter
                        with the Secretary of State who was about to enter the room with another
                        group for a meeting on another subject. The Secretary agreed that if this in
                        fact seemed to be the necessary final clincher for a successful outcome, I
                        should be authorized to indicate that an invitation from the President would
                        be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The President then gave me the signed letters for me to bear to the King of

                            <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> can pull this one off in
                        a few weeks, no one will be more surprised than he.</p>

                        talks during which I floated no possible formulae for settlement transit
                        problem but sought frank expression each government's policies and attitudes
                        while taking occasion myself to underline the President's deep personal
                        interest this matter and elements in situation which led US to see urgency
                        in arrival at some arrangement under which transit traffic would again move.
                        Reception and atmosphere both capitals cordial. Pakistanis, while showering
                        me with good wishes, did not conceal their belief timing good offices
                        premature and hence seriously in error tactically. Afghans repeatedly stated
                        appreciation my presence even if mission failed.</p>
                    <p>As you are aware from my earlier reports each government maintained with no
                        significant modification or even nuance public positions already taken with
                        same intensity of feeling as reported in detail in past weeks by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> respectively.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> stated he desired friendly
                        relations with Afghans and restoration diplomatic relations. He furthermore
                        reaffirmed in precise terms Pakistani intent to abide by 1958 transit
                        agreement and desire to see traffic resume, attaching however as conditions
                        (A) no reopening Afghan consulates in Pakistan, and (B) no venturing
                        Pakistani trucks and drivers across Afghan border in view Pakistan inability
                        protect them against mistreatment.</p>
                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0144"/>
                    <p>Afghan Government, notably <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> who
                        excelled <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> in frankness, stated
                        Afghans desired friendly relations with Pakistan and resumption diplomatic
                        relations. He denied Afghans in effect blockaded themselves on transit route
                        through Pakistan but stated flatly reopening of Afghan consulates and trade
                        agencies in Pakistan was sine qua non for freight to move once more on
                        transit route.</p>
                    <p>In effect <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> hoped I would “beat
                        some sense into bloody minds of Afghan Royal Family”, while <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> quite plainly said Pakistanis were
                        people to whom I should talk since they had unilaterally blocked transit and
                        Afghans the injured party.</p>
                    <p>First round my talks confirmed public positions two governments are
                        diametrically opposed with little in common save reciprocal professions of
                        desire to improve relations. Despite my emphasis in both capitals on limited
                        terms my mission, greater part my listening time was spent on Pushtunistan,
                        which is black background of their relations with each other and makes
                        extremely difficult devising solution to transit problem, resumption of
                        which is of such vital importance to Afghan and of some economic benefit to
                        Pakistanis in Peshawar region. Being now on the ground, I feel even greater
                        urgency attached to effort restore transit traffic. Every week which passes
                        will I believe increase Afghan's already substantial economic dependence on
                        Soviet Union and lead ultimately to its total loss of freedom. Delay in
                        reopening Karachi route will make it daily more difficult for us to justify
                        to ourselves continuing forward programming and procurement for present US
                        economic aid program to Afghan. On latter, however, I recommend no negative
                        decisions be taken in Washington at least until outcome my mission
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>I have in mind a formula to present early next week separately to both
                        governments. In essence it would entail successive unilateral declarations
                        by Pakistan and Afghan Governments in that order which would include
                        statement intention of each to appoint liaison officer provided for under
                        transit agreement but never appointed. Afghan liaison officer with
                        “additional liaison officers” (latter posted in Peshawar, Chaman and Karachi
                        respectively) would operate with appropriate facilities and immunities in
                        Pakistan to facilitate transit services. This would be portrayed in
                        presentation by me hopefully as first in series of steps, last of which
                        would be renewal diplomatic relations and thereafter negotiation re
                        establishment such consulates in each country as might then be agreed as
                        necessary to meet legitimate needs.</p>
                    <p>At Chaman Afghan trucks would enter Pakistan for distance necessary to load
                        at storage area located at present rail head. In Peshawar Pakistani trucks
                        would carry goods from storage areas to border point on Pakistan side Tor
                        Kham (at foot Khyber Pass) and transfer loads to Afghan vehicles. Pakistanis
                        would start promptly construction necessary storage and related facilities
                        at Tor Kham. As interim measure pending provision minimum facilities at
                        border Afghan trucks would be <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0145"
                        />admitted to Peshawar to load food, medicine and diplomatic shipments now
                        there. Pakistan and Afghan liaison officers would be charged to undertake
                        urgent study repairing present rail line in Khyber area to actual border,
                        thereby in long term future enabling shipments from Karachi direct to Afghan
                        customs on both border crossing points. Finally, each government's
                        declaration would contain certain preambular recitals of desire restore good
                        neighborly relations, and suitable reference to US good offices, to
                        convention high seas, to transit agreement of 1958 and hopefully some
                        innocuous salad dressing mixed to recipe of each party. I would also seek
                        Pakistan agreement promptly to ratify and deposit instrument high seas
                        convention dealing with rights of land-locked countries, which conventions
                        both countries have signed but only Afghan ratified.</p>
                    <p>I will reduce foregoing formula with more precision and detail to draft
                        declarations. My plan thereafter is to return Rawalpindi and Kabul in that
                        order first of next week. In this second, and I assume final pair of visits,
                        I will explain these are not negotiating documents in usual sense but
                        represent my best effort find road out of impasse. Naturally, I will
                        consider any constructive counter-proposals or amendments not affecting key
                        elements but I believe it would be great mistake for me to become entangled
                        in protracted talks placing us in the middle. I will use my best efforts at
                        persuasion and as agreed before my departure will hold out no hope of reward
                        or threat of reprisal to either party. I will, however, be franker than by
                        design I was during first round in delineating consequences which I foresee
                        would follow failure achieve early resumption transit traffic.</p>
                    <p>I am deeply impressed with dangers inherent in present situation to
                        Afghanistan's continued freedom and non-alignment. I am also aware emotional
                        depth of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> commitment to policy of
                        firmness on northwest frontier. The latter attitude renders it dangerous to
                        our own national interest to apply what Paks would regard as excessive
                        pressure on them, with resultant harm to our relations with an ally which is
                        staunch and now cooperates in area vital to our own security. Realistically,
                        I believe odds are against successful achievement purpose my mission, but I
                        am by no means devoid of hope. One more week I judge will determine success
                        or failure and thereafter I believe it would be unwise for me to remain in
                        area.</p>

                    <p>“November 2, 1961</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I am sending you this personal note because of my deep conviction that only
                        your statesmanship can point the way to a resolution of the serious <pb
                            n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0147"/>situation which now exists between
                        your country and Afghanistan. I have been grateful to you for receiving
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>, and I hope you
                        will understand this more personal message.</p>
                    <p>The factors involved in this difficult problem are of course more familiar to
                        you than to me, and it is not in the spirit of our alliance for me to
                        attempt to press my judgment upon you. Nonetheless, I do venture to put
                        before you the thought that your own stature as a statesman, and the
                        strength of your country, may both make it possible for you, in this
                        situation, to take the large-minded and forgiving course, without any risk
                        that such a decision would be misinterpreted as weakness. Can you not take
                        the lead, as a strong neighbor, secure in his power and sure in his
                        judgment, by authorizing the re-establishment of consulates—or other
                        arrangements of comparable significance—which would assure the early
                        resumption of trade and traffic between your country and Afghanistan?</p>
                    <p>You must be concerned, I know, with serious questions of opinion among your
                        own people, and I understand the complexities which attend your relations
                        with Afghanistan. But from the point of view of our common interest in
                        limiting the further spread of Communist influence, there does seem to me to
                        be real danger in sustained interruption of Afghan freedom of transit. Your
                        country and mine, accustomed to our access to the sea, do not face the
                        problem which land-locked states so sensitively feel. It would be dangerous
                        for all of us if Afghanistan, in a search for alternatives, were forced into
                        excessive dependence on its northern neighbor.</p>
                    <p>Let me repeat, in closing, that I write quite personally, on the strength of
                        our friendship and understanding. I understand and respect the fact that the
                        authority and responsibility here are yours. Needless to say, if your
                        judgment takes you on a different course it will have no effect on our very
                        warm friendship. I have wanted, however, to share with you in this private
                        way my sense of the opportunity which your personal qualities make possible,
                        at a time of serious difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> remains at your
                        disposal for the exercise of our good offices in whatever way may be
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>With the warmest personal regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>“</p>
                    <p>If delivered, President desires message treated as privileged communication

                            that his government would agree to it. He agreed to review the proposal
                            with his colleagues “as a matter of routine,” and would meet again with

                            their response, but he anticipated that the meeting would only be a
                            “matter of form.” (Ibid., 689.90D/11-361) <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"

                            689.90D/11-561)</note> I also talked to him at Ambassador's dinner same
                        evening but nothing new developed. He was gracious but unwilling to discuss
                        transit or in fact any topic more recent than a millenium ago. He confirmed
                        my appointment with him Saturday morning but in reply my expression eager

                        meeting of Royal Family at Palace and of course it is possible new attitude
                        will emerge from that conclave.</p>
                    <p>At moment my judgment which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"

                        understimate difficulties <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would face in
                        restarting any suspended or sharply reduced country aid program. In this
                        connection, I am satisfied that a significant US aid program with
                        substantial though less effective presence of US advisors and technicians
                        could and should be maintained in Afghan even if (as might be unavoidably
                        decided by Washington) end came to projects dependent on bulk imports
                        delivery of which possible currently only though Karachi. Not all the
                        reasons for Afghan stubborness are openly stated or acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan position likewise not entirely on top of table. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> frankly has told me my good offices
                        mission prematurely timed. Reopening transit traffic promptly would no doubt
                        in his view relieve very pressure on Afghans which his hard policy is
                        designed to apply. Accordingly I believe his present purpose vis-a-vis US is
                        to give enough to avoid our being able exclusively to blame him for
                        intransigeance but not enough in any formula to enable Afghans in their
                        pride to accept.</p>
                    <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0150"/>
                    <p>My consequent conclusion is that it is best to leave matter as it stands
                        (assuming I can prevent final and flat Afghan “no”) and personally to depart
                        area making every effort by my departure statement (which when drafted I
                        will cable) that no legitimate basis will exist for public assumption good
                        offices effort has failed or ended. To try to push <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> further right now by any means I
                        believe would be unproductive. We must bear in mind his importance as an
                        ally and recognize he has in fact already made some distasteful concessions
                        in my present formula in order to meet part way our concern and sense
                        urgency which he decidedly does not share. Similarly I do not believe non-US
                        influence (such as by sympathetic third country ambassadors in Kabul) will
                        help with Afghans at this point. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1"
                            >Byroade</persName> can and will work unrelentingly on Royal Family and
                        other personalities in Kabul, but basically I think passage of time with (1)
                        more evident disastrous effect on trade and economic development from loss
                        German as well as US imports resulting from what is substantially
                        self-imposed blockade of Pakistan route and (2) increasing feeling of
                        nakedness with Russians must do its essential work before any formula
                        falling short of their currently stated demands will prove acceptable. On
                        this point Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> is far
                        from convinced of validity my estimate Afghan reaction to pressures of time
                        will be rational.</p>
                    <p>Foregoing paragraphs are premised on no change in present Afghan attitude as
                        stated to me November 2 before I depart for Karachi.</p>
                    <p>I wish to repeat that formula I brought here from Pindi in my judgment would

                        believe early visit to US unrelated to good offices on transit would

                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> and his party on
                        November 6 in Newport, Rhode Island. The visit continued in Washington
                        November 7-9. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>'s memorandum
                        noted that <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> was the only
                        Department of State official present during or informed of the other
                        meetings during the visit between <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName>, and indicated that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> would prepare memoranda
                        regarding those meetings. No such memoranda have been found.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of tension between the United States and the Soviet
                        Union over Berlin.]</p>
                    <p>Turning to another subject, the President acknowledged the importance India
                        places in its geographic situation in relation to its foreign <pb n="129"
                            xml:id="pg_129" facs="0155"/>policy. He also recalled that the United
                        States had been neutralist for a long time. Nevertheless he wanted to say
                        that we would like India to oppose us on issues when we were wrong and to
                        support us on those occasions when we might be right. The Prime Minister
                        welcomed the opportunity afforded by this comment to explain the Indian
                        approach to international issues. Indians naturally seek to act on the merit
                        of each matter, the Prime Minister said, but he attaches importance to the
                        manner of approach as well. He wants to create the feeling that India wants
                        to be friendly and wants to cooperate with other nations even though it does
                        not necessarily agree with each of them on a particular point. It is not a
                        question of finding a midway position between the United States and the
                        Soviet Union; that would have no meaning, really. The worst of the cold war
                        is that it makes everyone rigid in mind and in spirit and so it becomes
                        difficult for either side to deal with the other side. If the way to war is
                        obstructed, then a feeling will come that matters can be dealt with in other
                        ways, and the approach becomes easier.</p>
                    <p>The President described the foreign policy of the United States as, of
                        course, to support countries with democratic systems, but even more
                        basically to support national sovereignty. Sometimes this means, unhappily,
                        that we support governments not fully supported by their own people. Yet it
                        is not always easy to withdraw. In some places we believe that if we should
                        withdraw communism might take over by subversion. This is the problem that
                        faces us; we don't object when communists take over by electoral means as
                        Jagan did in British Guiana.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked why communism has an appeal to many people. Mainly,
                        he felt, it develops in poor and underdeveloped countries. The President
                        pointed out that in many areas communism takes over by force and subversion.
                        The Prime Minister agreed that no one would view with approval terroristic
                        tactics, adding, however, that military actions bring unfortunate results.
                        The very act of meeting a situation militarily may make it worse. For
                        example, with the help of United States forces a situation may be cleared
                        but it is very likely that the position of the leaders then becomes weaker
                        because of their dependence on an outside power. Thus the problem is not
                        settled.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained that we
                        are faced with a situation in which we are making efforts to settle the Laos
                        problem but at the same time there are serious attacks on South Vietnam,
                        some of them via Laos. If these should succeed, it would look as if by our
                        willingness to negotiate on Laos we had lost both Laos and Vietnam. That
                        would discredit our efforts and make it impossible for us to negotiate on
                        other issues, including Berlin.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> interjected that
                        several members of this Administration have had the view that truly neutral
                        countries offer opportunities for us to help economically to build them up.
                        If in Laos or <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0156"/>in any other country
                        neutralism becomes merely a stage which precedes a communist takeover then
                        the whole concept of neutralism will become a stench in the nostrils. The
                        question is what India and other countries can do about this.</p>
                    <p>Agreeing that there is a question of what to do, Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> observed that the whole idea in the
                        Geneva Conference of 1954 was to create international commissions to meet
                        this situation. To some extent it has been the failure to live up to these
                        commitments that has led to later difficulties. If the commissions had not
                        been there he was convinced that trouble would have come much sooner in
                        Vietnam. In Laos, indeed, trouble did come after the commission was closed
                        down. These things don't always happen according to plans or our decision.
                        We can affect them sometimes but not always. The Prime Minister said he
                        realized the position of the United States is difficult because the United
                        States is tied up in many matters from which it is difficult to come
                        out.</p>
                    <p>On Laos the President said that the United States will try to persuade the
                        three Princes to come together promptly, in this month of November. But, he
                        added, we don't want our efforts in Laos to end in a collapse in South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the question of nuclear testing, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> began by assuring the Prime
                        Minister that the United States had not prepared for testing during the test
                        ban negotiations. Since those negotiations broke down we have had about
                        three small underground tests. This is in sharp contrast to what the Soviets
                        have done. We are now faced with what to do in the future. A few days
                        earlier he had announced that we would now prepare for testing in the
                        atmosphere. This does not mean we will necessarily conduct tests in the
                        atmosphere. We will examine the Soviet tests. If they have done something
                        that would really change the balance of power—such as making a genuine
                        anti-missile missile or a way of disrupting radar—we could not ignore that.
                        Obviously, however, the President would prefer not to have tests. The U.S.
                        will not have them unless we must. The President wished that the Soviets
                        would agree to ban atmospheric testing. If they do not agree either to that
                        or to inspection, we will face a difficult decision. It is hard to be
                        optimistic when after three years of negotiations the Soviets will not agree
                        to the kind of inspection the British and we think necessary. In fact,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added, they have
                        interjected the troika concept into the inspection process. We cannot accept
                        the veto inherent in that.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister, agreeing that these are difficulties, asked how then are
                        we to deal with these problems? Presumably the present drift can land the
                        world in a nuclear war. This is a terrible prospect. The moratorium by
                        itself does stop the testing. That could allow the treaty to come in. The
                        treaty has been discussed for three years; it need not require too much
                        further discussion.</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that it
                        seems obvious the Soviet Union made the decision to resume testing some
                        months ago, perhaps last February or March. This Government made a major
                        effort to get an agreement with the Soviet Union and he is very disappointed
                        that it has not been achieved. He quite agreed that the drift goes on. The
                        Chinese are going to start testing. The French already have done so. In the
                        absence of an agreement, testing will be started by one country after
                        another.</p>
                    <p>How then to stop this, the Prime Minister asked. It will be a very dangerous
                        situation if the Chinese start testing. In India people rather pooh poohed
                        that prospect but the Chinese are proceeding with it, probably more for
                        prestige reasons than otherwise. The hope in the situation lies in the fact
                        that it is to the advantage of the Soviet Union not to have war. If some
                        treaty can be obtained fairly soon it may be possible for the Soviet Union
                        to forestall testing by China.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> suggested that
                        perhaps the Soviet Union resists a test ban either because it feels that
                        China would not agree to this or because it really does not want an
                        inspection process operating within its borders. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that if Khrushchev believes
                        secrecy of the Soviet system to be of very large strategic value then it is
                        very difficult to see how we can proceed into another moratorium without
                        running the risk of being duped. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName> agreed that the Secretary had correctly described the
                        Soviet position on secrecy. The problem will remain as long as there is a
                        danger of using nuclear weapons. If an assurance can be obtained that they
                        will not be used then the fear does not arise. If disarmament can go that
                        far there is some hope. Anyhow the big question is how one can deal with the
                        situation with its risks of accidents and all.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that the
                        records of the 1914 war, the second world war and the Korean war, each of
                        which started in quite distinct circumstances, make it rather hard to see
                        which course will succeed in preventing a future war. Possibly the best
                        course is to indicate with precision where our vital interests lie—and then
                        (he added with a smile) hope that India can be effective as a
                        peacemaker.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> went on to say that
                        one matter that had been discussed with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> when he was in Washington was the
                        problem of Kashmir. The danger to the peace is obviously of deep concern to
                        us and to others. We hope our role can be as helpful as possible. In this
                        spirit, the President wondered whether the Prime Minister could see any line
                        of settlement that would be acceptable both to India and to Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Responding, the Prime Minister noted that the Kashmir case is now in its
                        fourteenth year. The matter arose in October 1947. At the end of 1948 after
                        fifteen months of fighting a cease-fire was arranged. Since then, apart from
                        occasional troubles, the cease-fire has functioned. Naturally, he said,
                        India's desire has been to settle the issue. India has discussed <pb n="132"
                            xml:id="pg_132" facs="0158"/>the problem directly with Pakistan and
                        there have been several <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediators—good
                        people—but without result.</p>
                    <p>Recalling in some detail the history of the Kashmir case, the Prime Minister
                        added that basically the Indian position is that no settlement is possible
                        except on the basis of the situation as it now exists—with minor
                        modifications. India cannot accept the Pakistani theory that because the
                        majority of the people in Kashmir are Muslims, Kashmir should go to
                        Pakistan. That theory would crack up India which has 45,000,000 Muslims and
                        is the third largest Muslim state in the world. Without any fault of theirs,
                        the 45,000,000 Muslims in India have become associated with the religious
                        argument that Pakistan puts forward, and would suffer.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister noted that in Kashmir there had been two general elections
                        and economic progress and land reform. Nothing like this had occurred on the
                        other side. Probably if India allowed people from the other side to come
                        into Kashmir, there would be considerable inward migration.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister observed that one Pakistani Prime Minister, before General
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, had accepted the idea of
                        the status quo in Kashmir. This man had thought it better to let the Kashmir
                        issue simmer down while India and Pakistan were solving their other
                        problems. Toward this end there had been resolution of the canal waters
                        issue, with India contributing many tens of millions of dollars. Various
                        frontier matters had also been settled. In the last year or so, however,
                        there had been renewed agitation over Kashmir. This was a matter of surprise
                        to India, which thought the Kashmir situation settling down.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister pointed out that the partition of India left tens of
                        thousands of families with members on both sides and many emotional ties
                        between people in the two countries. It is a most extraordinary situation,
                        which now needs to be allowed to quiet down. Perhaps later the two countries
                        could have some form of confederation or something else. Kashmir is not a
                        matter of the territory—actually, the territory is a burden on India—so much
                        as it is a matter of life. The Prime Minister recalled that his own
                        ancestors had come down from Kashmir nearly 300 years ago and that Kashmir
                        has been one of the biggest centers of Indian culture for the past 2000-3000
                        years; thus the Kashmir question is a largely emotional issue. As a
                        practical matter, raising the Kashmir issue now would uproot all the Indians
                        have done. In three months India is going to have general elections
                        (something Pakistan does not have) and if this problem is touched off now
                        there will be huge troubles. People would be migrating with all their
                        bitterness. That would not be a solution—just more upheavals. With Pakistan
                        developing a conservative Muslim outlook (although <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> is not a religious figure, but a
                        Sandhurst product) practically speaking the present situation cannot be
                        changed. No government of India could function, certainly not his
                        government, if <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0159"/>this were to happen.
                        Possibly a narrow vindictive government might then function, but only that
                        kind. It would be a difficult enough matter to get the Indian Parliament and
                        people to accept the status quo. They certainly would not accept a revision
                        of boundaries to India's detriment.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> asked whether,
                        while the two parts of Kashmir remained, a much more relaxed access could be
                        arranged from one side of Kashmir to the other. Could this be a possible
                        alternative to the narrow territorial debate? The Prime Minister responded
                        that if the territorial claims were dropped all other questions could be
                        resolved easily. He then recapitulated the history of the military action in
                        Kashmir, concluding that India is now again threatened by tribal invasion.
                        Although nothing is officially stated, there are reports of 100,000
                        tribesmen coming. That is a very difficult situation.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether in the Prime Minister's judgment it would then
                        not be feasible to anticipate a solution to the problem that both India and
                        Pakistan could accept. The Prime Minister replied that he had felt a little
                        before <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> came in that the two
                        countries would settle on the basis of the status quo, with some
                        modifications of the cease-fire line to make it a proper international
                        frontier. However the difficulties remain. Another difficulty is that in
                        part of Kashmir, Ladakh, the Chinese have committed their aggression. To
                        annoy India, the Pakistanis started to flirt with the Chinese on this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Returning once more to the question, the President observed that there would
                        be a somewhat better use of resources if India and Pakistan were at peace
                        and asked whether there is anything the United States can do to help the
                        situation. Responding, the Prime Minister said that even now the bitterness
                        of partition is dying down. While it can again be whipped up by exploiting
                        religion he felt and hoped it would settle down. The Prime Minister noted
                        some important differences between the leaders of India and Pakistan. When
                        independence came the Indian group had been leaders and they came naturally
                        into the government and then stayed on through elections. Pakistan, however,
                        was a negative proposition based on hatred of India and the feeling of
                        landlords to exploit Islam. Its only policy was hatred of India. Persons who
                        came to the front had actually opposed freedom. They all came from top
                        landlord families. A nation could not be built, however, just on hatred of
                        India and Pakistan found that out. When <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> came to power he had some following at the beginning
                        because he got rid of the unpopular people who had been in charge. Once that
                        was done <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, with his rather
                        limited military mind, could think of nothing but cleaning up the streets of
                        Karachi under martial law. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> is no
                        stranger to Indians. Every senior officer in the Indian Army knows Ayub well
                        and has his judgment of him.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister added that throughout he himself has been popular with
                        people in Pakistan, even though some of his closest friends <pb n="134"
                            xml:id="pg_134" facs="0160"/>have been jailed for their political
                        activities there. The situation is such a pity.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> observed that the
                        Prime Minister was being somewhat severe in describing Pakistani policy as
                        only hatred of India. The Ambassador had worked with their planning people
                        and Pakistani planning, while not up to the standard of India, has been
                        quite good. The Prime Minister agreed that of course there are some people
                        interested in helping the country.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> then turned to the
                        question of American aid to India and Pakistan. Many Americans, he said,
                        believe that we would do better to give actual funds to Pakistan and let
                        them decide what they want to spend on military aid and what on economic
                        aid. The difficulty is that it is easier to get funds from Congress for
                        military assistance than for economic assistance. The military assistance
                        enables the Pentagon to sell second-hand equipment to other countries and in
                        effect to use the proceeds to get new equipment. Nevertheless, if giving
                        only economic assistance to Pakistan is the right thing to do, we should
                        look into ways to do it.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> added military
                        assistance to Pakistan still makes big headlines in India. The United States
                        gave India a half billion dollars for economic aid and gave Pakistan twelve
                        airplanes. There were twelve times as many questions in the Indian
                        Parliament about the planes as about the aid. The Prime Minister responded
                        that no one in India except communists want to run down the United States.
                        Indians do not doubt the intentions of Americans, but Pakistan is still a
                        military dictatorship and Indians doubt what it might do.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> intervened to suggest to
                        the Prime Minister that in talking of “minor border adjustments” in Kashmir
                        the Prime Minister had used the same phrase that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had used when he discussed the Kashmir
                        issue with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed, however,
                        that we did not know exactly what President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> had had in mind when he spoke of “minor border
                        adjustments.”</p>
                    <p>The President then asked the Prime Minister what, as a student of
                        personality, is his estimate of Nkrumah in Ghana. Does the Prime Minister
                        think Ghana is a good investment for the United States?</p>
                    <p>Ghana itself is a good investment, the Prime Minister responded. However,
                        Nkrumah is rather paranoic and does think of himself as the leader of
                        Africa. He asked Indian help in training their Air Force. The Indian
                        officers did go and ultimately he turned them out and handed the job to the
                        British. Now he has turned them out. Some Israelis have had experience there
                        too. The Prime Minister himself had not been to Ghana nor indeed to Africa,
                        except Egypt and Sudan.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had also wanted to ask the Prime Minister about Tito,
                        i.e. does the Prime Minister think Tito is likely to tie into the <pb
                            n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0161"/>Soviet Union more closely? The
                        Prime Minister responded that the Yugoslavs have done rather well. He does
                        not think they will change their basic policies. In foreign policy the
                        Yugoslavs are basically anti-German. Thus they will agree with the Soviet
                        Union on German questions though not really on others. He must admit that he
                        was rather surprised at the Soviet position at the Belgrade Conference.
                        There were many countries there. Non-aligned countries are so non-aligned
                        that they do not agree even among themselves. Africa, of course, is in a
                        state of turmoil. This is a fascinating and dangerous time. There are many
                        Indians in Africa and the Prime Minister advises them to be friendly and
                        helpful. In spite of everything Africa is a confident nation, full of
                        vitality.</p>
                    <p>Returning to Tito, the President explained that our ambition has been to see
                        Tito's Yugoslavia succeed as a national communist state which we have felt

                        my recommendations. In the matter of the future economic aid program to
                        Afghanistan, he indicated to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"

                        steps to be taken to overcome difficulties caused by continuing impasse.
                        Basic conclusion is that since resolution of transit impasse is not an

                        program to Afghanistan is unavoidable due to sheer physical circumstances.
                        At same time, it is <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desire to maintain

                                    to alter the U.S. aid program in Afghanistan unless there was a
                                    political motive for doing so. He stated that Afghan Government
                                    studies indicated that it would cost no more to ship the
                                    materials involved through Iran than through Pakistan. Hence,
                                    the only purpose for altering the aid program must be to put
                                    pressure on Afghanistan to settle the dispute. <persName

                                    intent underlay the proposed changes in U.S. aid to Afghanistan.
                                    He stated that U.S. information indicated that the costs
                                    involved in shipping through Iran would be considerably greater
                                    than through Pakistan. (Telegram 359 from Kabul, November 16;

                                    in Afghanistan should continue, by whatever means possible. He

                    <p>The President received the Indian Defense Minister to fulfill informal
                        commitments that had arisen in a brief encounter between them at the United
                        Nations last fall and in the course of the President's recent meetings with
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>. The role of the
                        United Nations and the situation in Southeast Asia figured prominently in
                        their talk, which exposed significant differences in their views. In
                        particular they debated whether the external penetrations are responsible
                        for current troubles in South Vietnam. Countering the President's analysis,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> asserted he would
                        have to see the evidence to support any view but the domestic opposition to
                        the Diem regime explains South Vietnam's difficulties. After their meeting
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> met the press
                        before leaving the White House. Without saying what he had discussed with
                        the President, in response to questions he extensively restated his known
                        views on many issues.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's inquiry about the Defense Minister's health
                        following his recent operation, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> said he was feeling quite well now apart from headaches
                        and pains along his left side and his left arm and leg.</p>
                    <p>The President mentioned Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName>'s meeting in Cairo with Tito and Nasser. Commenting
                        that these meetings are not as important as the press makes them out to be,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> observed that the
                        meeting was possibly useful to Nasser, who had been somewhat shaken by the
                        loss of Syria (which of course he had not wanted in the first place) and had
                        encountered some opposition to his new land reform and other economic
                        programs—opposition not among the people, but among the more privileged
                        groups.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> told the President he
                        had suggested that disarmament discussion at this session of the U.N.
                        General Assembly be terminated, <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0166"/>as
                        continuation would only generate more bitterness and reduce the chance of an
                        agreement between the great powers. The United Nations cannot write
                        contracts between countries, he said; it can only formulate principles.
                        After they have been formulated, the next step is to find modalities by
                        which the affected parties can negotiate agreements. The President observed
                        that if this argument were carried far the U.N. might sink to merely urging
                        that disputing powers meet bilaterally and solve their problems. In his view
                        the U.N. has a more important role. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> replied that the United Nations cannot do everything.
                        It has no sanctions. It is not a parliament of man. It is a place where
                        people come together to talk and to that extent it is a concert of nations.
                        Its effectiveness is in laying down certain principles, as when the U.S. and
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> agreed on principles of
                        disarmament which had grown out of last year's twelve-power resolution. If
                        the great powers agree on any motion, it will go through. The President
                        noted that, whereas in 1945 the U.N. had been built on the presumption of
                        accord among the great powers, the situation had changed since then and the
                        U.N. could not ignore these changes.</p>
                    <p>The President raised the question of Vietnam. He urged the importance of
                        doing an effective job in Vietnam now, else that country will disintegrate
                        into an arena of actions and counter-actions that could have serious
                        consequences. There have been problems about the International Control
                        Commission, but if the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could function
                        effectively now and identify the forces from the North that are operating in
                        South Vietnam, that would help the situation. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Krishna Menon</persName> asserted that effective operation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Vietnam has been jeopardized not
                        by its own actions or by positions taken by its Polish or Canadian members
                        but by Diem, who had refused to let the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                        function freely. As to the presence of forces from North Vietnam in South
                        Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> was
                        skeptical. He would like to see the evidence. He believes that North Vietnam
                        does not have the forces to send south. Even when the Viet Minh were
                        fighting the French their forces were in a bad way. What South Vietnam has
                        in fact is a lot of locally-based Communists who are adherents of Vietnam by
                        day and of the Viet Minh by night.</p>
                    <p>Without impugning <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s
                        approach to the problem, the President stated that we would be delighted to
                        participate in any objective examination of the facts in the situation and
                        in any real observance of the Geneva accords. Indeed, we ourselves had
                        observed the Geneva accords on entry of personnel into South Vietnam until
                        the last few days. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>
                        asserted that the Geneva accords had allowed a certain number of French to
                        remain in South Vietnam, but had not transferred this allowance to other
                        countries. Rightly or wrongly, India had subsequently agreed to let
                        Americans be substituted for French, even though India had been criticized
                        by some for taking this position. What is really needed, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> added, is the neutrality of
                        all areas in Indochina. In Laos it is a question of the three Princes.
                        Souvanna Phouma knows <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0167"/>that his
                        future depends upon his not being absorbed by either the left or the right.
                        The sooner he gets a government functioning, the better it will be.
                        Souphanouvong is not a Communist but rather a “left-nationalist” like some
                        of India's progressive former Maharajahs. Phoumi is just a vagabond, though
                        of course he must be included in the government. The three Princes are
                        brothers and aristocrats and they ought to be able to get along. Once the
                        government is set up, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Laos can be
                        helpful, though it can only function with the good will of the government
                        and as India has said from the beginning cannot become a super-government.
                        That conception is not practical. If Laos can be settled, that will be a
                        factor of stability in the whole area. The President agreed that the latter
                        point was correct and that we would have to rely on Souvanna Phouma. He made
                        it clear he did not share <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName>'s estimate of Souphanouvong.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the question of South Vietnam, the President explained that he
                        would like to see the United States out of that area, but would not want its
                        withdrawal to leave control to the North. If South Vietnam should fall under
                        the Viet Minh in the next few months, a wave of domination by Communist
                        China could then sweep over South East Asia. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Krishna Menon</persName>, without commenting on this point, urged the
                        President to recognize that the United States can deal with the Russian
                        Communists, who have been in office for fifty years and are settling down.
                        Unless the U.S. settles the Indochinese issues while the Russians are still
                        there, however, it will have the Chinese to deal with and that would be much
                        worse.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> said that India is
                        sending a new man as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in
                        Vietnam and that the Chairman had told him he is quite clear that the North
                        does not want to unify Vietnam by warfare. Like Germany, Vietnam will remain
                        divided for a long time to come. The President observed that under present
                        circumstances the best thing is for Vietnam to remain divided. Our interest
                        is to get a neutral government in Laos and to avoid an unfavorable shift of
                        power in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>There followed a further exchange on the role of the North in South Vietnam's
                        troubles. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> insisted he

                        he had heard that some people from the South had gone North for training and
                        then returned South. He felt that the troubles in Vietnam result from
                        popular discontent with Diem's government and from militaristic opposition
                        in the South. The President agreed that in some parts of the world there are
                        popular movements against governments, as originally Castro's campaign
                        represented a popular movement against the Batista government. Such
                        movements do not, however, need to rely on terrorism, mutilation and
                        assassinations of the sort now going on in South Vietnam. This is not just
                        popular opposition to the Diem regime; this is a calculated attack intended
                        to undermine and destroy the South Vietnam Government. <pb n="142"

                                up this quarrel between two Muslim countries. Specifically,
                                suggestion might be made that King Saud address personal letter to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Dept has been
                                impressed by solution proposed several times here by Afghan
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMH1">Maiwandwal</persName>
                                (probably with <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> concurrence). It
                                calls for reopening of Afghan consulates and/or trade agencies but
                                in deference to <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> charges against
                                previous <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> officials would
                                authorize only <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> personnel who
                                have never before served in Pakistan. If Saud made this suggestion,
                                of course unattributed to <persName corresp="#p_MMH1"
                                    >Maiwandwal</persName>, it might find some favorable response
                                from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Coming from
                                “Keeper of Holy Places,” Saud letter might stress interest in Muslim
                                brotherliness and perhaps contain additional suggestion that feast
                                marking end of Ramadhan would be appropriate time for magnanimous
                                gesture by <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and for
                                public announcement resolution Pak-Afghan difficulties. Dept
                                believes letter might be sent some time in January assuming Saud has
                                left US by that time. If <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                                accepted this simple proposal, Dept foresees no great difficulty on

                            the force to drive the Chinese Communists from Ladakh. Thus the
                            Government is tempted to answer its foreign policy critics by making at
                            least a demonstration of force against Goa.</item>

                        <item>A widespread press campaign is now underway in India for government
                            action on the Goan issue. Two recent incidents off the Portuguese island
                            of Anjidiv (just south of Goa) have been widely publicized; Portuguese
                            military reinforcements are alleged, as well as Portuguese “atrocities”
                            against Goan “patriots.” It is public knowledge that troop movements
                            from Northern India to the vicinity of Goa are being organized. We have
                            learned that a movement of at least a division is being planned and the
                            logistics for this move were being arranged as of Dec. 1.</item>

                        <item>It should be our objective to counter these pressures for military
                            action, and to get the military activity halted well short of the
                            possibility of a full-scale military action. It can be argued with
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> that to attempt to resolve the Goan issue
                            by force will do enormous damage to Indian prestige and friendship where
                            India most needs friends (among the developed nations) to further the
                            Indian economic development drive. Such a resort to force would only
                            tend to promote further chaos in Africa, where India has done so much to
                            try to restore order, as in the Congo.</item>

                            private U.S. counter-pressure is likely to be ineffective. Should such
                            U.S. pressure take a purely negative form (e.g., “please stop your
                            military moves”) it will put the U.S. in the position of defending
                            reaction and, insofar as it becomes known, will provide highly
                            emotionally-charged ammunition to the Indian Communists and other

                            be adequate to enable U.S. representations to <persName>Nehru</persName>
                            to have some effect, and might dull the edge of the expected left-wing
                            attack on the U.S. in India. U.S. public support should come from the
                            President, and it should contain clear support at least for a greater
                            degree of self-government as the immediate goal the U.S. favors for Goa,
                            and the other Portuguese territories in South Asia.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>We recognize the possible disadvantages, vis-a-vis the Portuguese, of
                            taking a public position in support of self-determination for a
                            Portuguese territorial unit, and we recognize the difficulties inherent
                            in equating our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> relationship with
                            Portugal with this phase of our relations with India. Nevertheless, it
                            may be argued that recognition of the principle of self-determination,
                            and practical application of this principle to the extent of granting a
                            greater degree of self-government or at least holding a plebiscite,
                            could rebound to the advantage of the Portuguese. Since
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> undoubtedly realizes that his government
                            does not possess a God-given right to take over Goa but is supporting
                            the ideal of freedom from colonial rule, Portuguese measures to grant a
                            greater degree of self-government should relieve
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> of the necessity of yielding completely
                            to the extreme agitators. This in turn would place the Portuguese in a
                            more nearly tenable position. While the Portuguese will undoubtedly
                            condemn a U.S. Government statement as intervention in their internal
                            affairs, such action may be defended on the ground that it is part of
                            the peace-keeping process.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>It must be remembered that a declaration in support of
                            self-determination for Portuguese territories in the subcontinent would
                            undoubtedly have repercussions throughout the Portuguese empire in other
                            parts of Asia and Africa. On this point, however, we are inclined to
                            agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                            that the time has come to deal with this issue as a whole.</item>

                            the build-up of Indian military forces in the vicinity of Goa. Foreign
                            Minister Nogueira referred to an earlier assurance that the United

                    <p>His own position has been to assume <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                        not use force because it has said it would not; it would be contrary to its
                        basic policy; it would do such harm to Indian image. We have noted troop
                        movements but assumed they were not prelude actual invasion. He hoped
                        Ambassador could confirm these assumptions correct. Talbot pointed out US
                        position to oppose use force and that were troops to move across juridical
                        frontier we would expect matter to come to Security Council where US would

                        after 14 years in which Portugal has made no movement towards resolving
                        issue. He noted continuing Portuguese oppression in Goa and recent
                        Portuguese military reinforcements. He noted that Mexico December 6 had
                        offered in Delhi to use its influence to organize Latin American countries
                        to persuade Portugal “relieve tensions.” Prime Minister <persName

                            telegram 1038 from Karachi, December 16. The Ambassadors agreed that it
                            was inadvisable to inform the Pakistani Government about the policy
                            concerning the sale of military equipment, as proposed in this telegram.
                            The principal objection was the conviction of the Embassy in Karachi
                            that to do so would cause major damage to U.S. relations with Pakistan.
                            The Ambassadors disagreed on the desirability of indicating to the
                            Indian Government U.S. willingness to receive military aid requests from
                            India. <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> felt strongly
                            that to accede to such requests would have a similarly adverse effect

                    <p>The foregoing is our strongest line of argument. It remains my view that no
                        decision has been taken for land action and that with second thoughts on
                        relation of action to Indian traditions, danger will if anything recede.
                        However, I keep an escape clause on the effect of some incident, real or
                        contrived and the possibility of some form of sea blockade.</p>
                    <p>The following points bear emphasizing.</p>

                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>We must sharply separate our case against the use of force, which is
                            valid, against any suggestion that we are responsive to pressure by
                            Portuguese. This commits us to support of Portuguese Empire since
                            everyone knows this is the interest of the Portuguese Government. In
                            this connection statement to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1"
                                >Nehru</persName> that we are approaching him at the behest of the
                            Portuguese was ill-advised. Gore-Booth notes that British also anxious
                            to avoid giving impression they are responsive to Portuguese.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In asking Indians to forego force on this issue question remains as to
                            what brings the Portuguese to settle. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"

                            and known attitudes of President and administration are helpful. A much
                            stronger declaration of non-support to Portugal on colonies would do
                            more to persuade Indians to be patient though I realize practical

                        <item>We are surprised by suggestion Portugal will take issue to <gloss

                        <item>Our latest reports from India indicate there has been an Indian
                            Government decision at least at the Cabinet Defense Committee level to
                            proceed with an armed attack on Goa. The Indian military forces appear
                            to be very nearly in position for such an attack which could be made
                            this week. The reports stress that the final decision has not yet been
                            made and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> is
                            capable of calling off the action at the last minute. However, the
                            build-up for an attack has already gone so far that it would create a
                            morale problem among the public as well as in the armed forces if the
                            attack were to be withheld without any progress being made towards
                            freeing Goa from Portuguese control.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>On December 8 I called in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1"
                                >Nehru</persName> and made clear to him the United States opposition
                            to the use of force by India in the Goan situation. On that day
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, at his press
                            conference, made the <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0180"/>same point
                            and added that we welcomed the indications then evident that both sides
                            wished to avoid force. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                                >Galbraith</persName> spoke to Prime Minister <persName

                            not to use force in the Goa situation, emphasizing that in the present
                            state of the world we felt it would do a serious disservice to peace for
                            India to put its armies in motion. He reports that the Prime Minister
                            gave no impression as to any effect of this plea. Yesterday afternoon I
                            made a similar plea to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1"
                                >Nehru</persName> when the latter called on me to report the answer

                            aware of its opposition to the use of force through conversations of

                            Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The U.K. feels that because of

                            activist groups within Goa who are capable of some subversive action

                            Office rejected this proposal out of hand. The Portuguese have indicated
                            they would like our public support for their international observer
                            proposal, but we have not yet given an answer. The proposal may be a

                            Delhi, December 9, reported that the Department had received information
                            that a journalist in India had filed a story alleging that an Indian
                            attack upon Goa was imminent, and that India had been assured that if
                            the attack took place the United States would not support Portugal. The
                            Department emphasized that no such assurance had been given and
                            reiterated its opposition to the use of force in the Goan dispute. The

                            filed the story. (Ibid., 753D.00/12-961)</note> In view of the overnight
                        developments, I decided to make one more effort this morning to persuade
                        India against armed action on Goa. I accordingly delivered letter quoted
                        next following telegram to <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName

                            xml:id="d70fn3">In his letter, Galbraith pointed out that India's
                            leading role as a champion for the peaceful settlement of international
                            disputes would be seriously compromised by armed action against Goa, and
                            a dangerous precedent set for similar action in disputes festering
                            elsewhere. He cited The New York Times editorial that noted that
                            colonialism was dying in Africa and Asia and U.N. resolutions calling
                            for an end to colonialism, as evidence that India was not without
                            resources in seeking a peaceful settlement to the dispute over Goa.
                            (Telegram 1691 from New Delhi, December 12; ibid.,
                            753D.00/12-1261)</note> To be at all persuasive you will understand it
                        was essential to suggest sympathy for anti-colonial aspect and some
                        alternative. Hence The New York Times extract which avoids official
                        commitment and the reference to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and world
                        support. Portugal will not like but presumably will appreciate armed action
                        less.</p>

                    <p>I had a long and urgent talk with <persName>Desai</persName> afterwards
                        impressing on him the stake which India had in the avoidance of armed
                        solution. He <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0182"/>noted the shooting on
                        border and adjoining waters. I also said they surely realized the world
                        would not believe that Portugal was attacking India and that what India was
                        calling a naval concentration consisted of a couple of antique gunboats. I
                        have a feeling that <persName>Desai</persName> admitted the force of my
                        argument but he made it clear that the matter was passing rapidly beyond his
                        hands. At the end of the discussion he said specifically that unless the
                        Portuguese made some major concession within the next couple of days, he
                        believed action would go forward. My estimate of the likelihood of such
                        action is now getting rather high. Some vague indication of U.S.
                        acquiescence to action was picked up by <persName corresp="#p_NBK1">B.K.
                            Nehru</persName> in Washington. I told <persName>Desai</persName> this

                        addressees). We appreciate great efforts you are making to stop Indians from
                        a decision to use force against Goa and we wish we could help with
                        Portuguese. Unfortunately, unanimous estimate here is that Portuguese will
                        not give an inch on this in any time span that would help you, and an
                        approach from us would only bring recriminations and bitter comparisons to
                        our consistent stand on negotiating in face of threat of force in Berlin and
                        elsewhere. So we have few cards to give you.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we believe you should make it clear to <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        now that, if Indians attack Goa, issue will certainly be brought to <gloss

                    <p>Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> recognizes that Goa is
                        a colonial issue, and recognizes that colonial age is passing, and has and

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> emphasized U.S. belief some

                        Pakistan, so that both countries could concern themselves more fully with
                        other problems. If settlement not reached at time when Indian and Pakistani
                        officials in office who had previously served together and had basic
                        friendship, difficulties in future would be greatly enhanced. He thought
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> would like to settle Kashmir. Latter had
                        indicated his concept of settlement as being partition at cease-fire line
                        with some adjustments. Moreover, Indians now preoccupied with forthcoming
                        elections and this did not seem propitious time to press negotiations. U.S.
                        Government was, however, hopeful that progress might be made after elections
                        and would continue to do what it could in line with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s discussions with <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> expressed gratitude that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had discussed
                        matter with <persName>Nehru</persName> and that he had arranged to have him
                        informed of developments. He then outlined his position on Kashmir and
                        emphasized that settlement this issue indispensable to good relations
                        between India and Pakistan. Until settlement reached, large portions of
                        their armies would be facing each other and nations could not collaborate in
                        such matters as defense against common external threat to the subcontinent
                        in which they both should be vitally concerned.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> reported
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s comment that settlement with Pakistan would
                        help internal communal situation in India, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> said this was a point he had previously stressed to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and seemed pleased to hear it affirmed.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said important thing in any
                        talks with <persName>Nehru</persName> was for them to come together with a
                        view to working things out. Talks not predicated on desire on both sides for
                        solution would not improve matters.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> talked generally of line of
                        settlement he had mentioned to <persName>Nehru</persName> which avoided
                        direct clash on territorial question by mutual access arrangement to Vale.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> listened with interest but
                        did not comment specifically.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was not specific in
                        indicating his view of elements of settlement, he again referred
                        particularly to importance of Pakistan controlling headwaters of rivers
                        flowing from Kashmir upon which its economy depends. In describing dangers
                        of possible future diversions, he emphasized only Chenab river and included
                        territory considerably below Srinagar in the Vale of Kashmir as important
                        for Pakistan to control. He said while problem related also to other rivers,
                        this would not concern Pakistan greatly since possibilities of diversion
                        were small.</p>

                    <p>1767. I saw Prime Minister at 10 a.m. for half an hour. I told him we could
                        not honestly promise to move Portugal in immediate future, and if issue came
                        before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> we would be obliged to take stand
                        against India, not with a view to embarrassing him but consistent with our
                        opposition to use of force. I then said I had done all that persuasion could
                        accomplish and would not reiterate previous arguments. We then had a long
                        discussion in which I went back over previous arguments and several new
                        ones. Latter included impression of grave weakness conveyed to all,
                        including ghost of Gandhi, if India, having removed the British and French
                        without fighting, should now have to resort to it for mere Portuguese. I
                        noted age of Salazar and indications of internal dissent in Portugal as
                        harbingers of change emphasizing the obvious time limit on the Portuguese
                        colonial empire in Africa and all that meant. <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        noted situation deteriorating rapidly and that many innocent people were
                        likely to suffer or be killed in this situation. I pointed out that most of
                        the shooting so far had been in newspapers, he himself had said the
                        casualties were negligible, and that my research indicated that only one
                        unfortunate seemed to have got in front of bullet. Why then should a strong
                        government with a well-disciplined army anticipate disorder and bloodshed
                        that had not occurred.</p>
                    <p>The conversation throughout was friendly even on the tough points like the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the newsprint atrocities.</p>
                    <p>It is my feeling I may have moved him a bit, that he was even looking for
                        arguments. Would also note he was very sensitive to the reactions of the
                        President. It is still my feeling that the decision is to act on Goa or
                        conceivably other enclaves probably tomorrow, but possibly we may have
                        produced one more pause for reflection and pressure from <persName

                            invasion of Goa would trigger a reaction in the United States that would
                            force the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> administration
                            to oppose the Indian action in the United Nations and make it difficult
                            to maintain Congressional support for assistance to India. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that if Prime Minister

                            suspension of action for 6 months, the United States would be willing to
                            undertake a serious effort to help bring about a peaceful solution to
                            the problem. (Ibid., 753D.00/12-1661) A memorandum of this conversation
                            is ibid., Secretary's Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D 330.</note> On
                        receipt of reference telegram 4:00 this afternoon I sought appointment with
                        Prime Minister and got to him at 8:00 for an hour. I used every resource at
                        my command for acceptance of proposal but so far as I can presently tell
                        without success. It wasn't a bad card but it was too late. In
                        might-have-been department, last week might have worked.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> was still very angry over Portuguese refusal
                        to accept part of U Thant letter specifying <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> resolutions.<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">On December 14,
                            Acting U.N. Secretary-General U Thant addressed identical letters to
                            Indian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> and
                            Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Salazar. He urged them to “ensure that
                            the situation does not deteriorate to the extent that it might
                            constitute a threat to peace and security,” and to enter into
                            negotiations to seek a solution to the problem. (Public Papers of the
                            Secretaries-General of the United Nations, Vol. VI: U Thant, 1961-1964,
                            p. 74)</note> I argued this not known to the world and at this moment
                        Salazar's response looked better than his. The six months also set him back
                        a bit. He said that once the pressure was off Portuguese would sit still as
                        before. I provisionally modified the six-month period to sufficient period
                        to give time to put the arm on the Portuguese but without effect. He also
                        asked what success we had had in budging Portuguese so far. Both question of
                        what Portuguese would do in six months and effect of our approach so far
                        exceedingly tough to handle. Then we got to the gut issue which is he
                        believes they have gone beyond point of no return in public involvement.
                        This reinforced by assertion that volunteers are about to move in, internal
                        disorder is imminent along with accounts of Portuguese firing this morning.
                        I repeated my argument that none of this had yet involved serious bloodshed
                        and I referred finally to effect on American public opinion and mentioned
                        West New Guinea and again Congo. I asked if I should report there was no
                        chance, then fuzzed my question to keep issue open. He virtually told me
                        there was none. I said our offer stood and asked him to call.</p>

                    <p>I would now guess they are going to move and my estimate in fact is for
                        tomorrow morning. This confirmed by a heavy propaganda briefing by <gloss
                            target="#t_MEA1">MEA</gloss> this afternoon, a report this morning that
                        a police official of Diu had asked for a peaceful takeover and departure of
                        Gen <persName corresp="#p_KGBM1">Kaul</persName> without cancelling a Monday
                        dinner in my honor. Vice President who is much opposed to action also
                        reported to have said it is imminent. However I don't entirely exclude the
                        thought that they are keeping up a very high level of tension on the theory
                        that this is the only thing that really gets results. Sorry not to have
                        better news. If they move I will wire suggestions on Washington reaction for
                        which I urge close attention.</p>

                        marched into Goa and the smaller neighboring Portuguese territories of Damao
                        and Diu. Portuguese forces were heavily outnumbered and surrendered in all
                        three territories on December 19.</p>

                        reacted to the first reports of Indian troop movements by calling Indian

                    <p>2168. Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called in
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1">Nehru</persName> today on American
                        reaction to Goa. Said he hoped Ambassador informing his government fully of
                        American views so there would be no misunderstanding of problems we face
                        following Indian action. In response to Ambassador's question <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he not distinguishing between US
                        Government's views and non-official opinion because our ability achieve our
                        governmental goals greatly influenced by Congressional and public opinion.
                        Full effect of Goa action on American opinion yet to become evident but we
                        particularly concerned about impact on many facets U.S. policy, notably our
                        support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> including Congo operation and
                        our foreign aid program. Additionally, we fear “chain reaction” on thinking
                        of other nations on disputed territories elsewhere, as in West New Guinea.
                        Forces in US opposed to present policies would cite Indian action as further
                        argument we on wrong track. Added personal view that <persName

                        further complicates the situation. Looks as if by sending or allowing

                    <p>1918. I had extremely important meeting with <persName>Nehru</persName> this

                            noted that the Department of State was instructing Rountree to take the

                            however, that <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> was afraid

                            >Rountree</persName> a couple of days ago that Pakistanis were planning
                        to take Kashmir issue to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, the Indian
                        newspapers this morning carry stories of this intention. I went in to see
                        Prime Minister this afternoon ostensibly to say goodby but in fact to urge
                        direct discussion along lines of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RWM1"
                            >Rountree</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                        talk. I concentrated on this for an hour. At first he was disinclined and a
                        bit distant. I pictured unhappy consequences of a <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss> debate on this issue for all concerned. I asked him directly
                        if he were attracted by idea of a verbal slugging match between Zafrullah
                        Khan and <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>. He said no.
                        I pointed out that it would revive Goa antipathies, transfer them to Kashmir
                        and have a further bad effect on American public opinion. I reminded him
                        that he was being unfaithful to the comradeship of democratic leaders by
                        making matters worse for the President. He said he had no desire to do this.
                        I then asked him to consider the affirmative gains. By taking the lead in
                        asking Pakistan to discuss the question India would rehabilitate her moral
                        position, affirm her support of orderly process and persuade her critics she
                        had generosity of spirit. He asked what could be talked about and here I
                        improvised, noting that all problems including canal water dispute had
                        seemed impossible until the effort was made. Ingenuity and imagination might
                        partly modify, partly circumvent the territorial question, give the
                        Pakistanis firm guarantees on the river sources, provide access to the
                        valley, make it a free trade area, so forth and so on. I noted I had made
                        same points to both <persName>Nehru</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> without explosion. He said he was attracted by these
                        ideas and I then pressed him on the shortness of time involved. He then said
                        he was leaving town for two weeks, very soon thereafter would be out
                        campaigning and noted that the discussions were difficult while an election
                        was going on and his need to prepare public opinion including Kashmir
                        Government. I said <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> and I had
                        pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> the improbability
                        of progress before the Indian elections. But the important thing was to get
                        a clear manifestation of will to act and any case preparatory discussions
                        were essential for success. I urged that a prompt invitation go to General
                        Burki with a view to laying the ground for a
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        meeting. This would affirm Indian willingness to move further on the
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing will give the flavor of a much longer discussion. In the end in
                        response to a pin-down question, he said I could cable affirmation of his
                        sympathy for the idea and went on to say he would try to put steps in train
                        about General Burki's visit before leaving tomorrow and take matter up on
                        his return.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I feel it very important that the Pakistanis
                        know confidentially of this effort and respond agreeably to any initiative
                        while holding their fire on the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. There is
                        some chance that by real effort we can get <persName>Nehru</persName> to
                        negotiate after the election and give an earnest of progress. <gloss
                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debate would be bad for the Indians as well
                        as ourselves and while doing <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0192"
                        />nothing real for Paks would of course harden all lines. It would also be
                        opportunity for another Soviet intervention on behalf of India which one
                        sector of Indian public opinion will cheer. Would urge that <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> indicate discussion and make these
                        points to President with request for total discretion until I can do more
                        here. Pakistanis will be aware that having asked for a strong “intervention”
                        with <persName>Nehru</persName> on the Kashmir issue, they have had it. We
                        have right to hope accordingly they will take advantage of it and not pursue
                        the unpromising course of the New York debate.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName>Nehru</persName> that the matter was of so much importance
                        that I would plan to remain in Delhi rather than proceed to Switzerland as
                        planned and on to the States. He queried as to why since my absence would
                        coincide roughly with his. (I had previously told him reasons for journey.)
                        Accordingly, I will plan to leave as scheduled tomorrow evening but will
                        remain available next week through Martin, Geneva.</p>

                    <p>You may tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that as friend of

                        we are constrained to inquire whether, in light of Ambassador <persName

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear President</hi>, The forcible taking of Goa by
                        India has demonstrated what we in Pakistan have never had any illusions
                        about—that India would not hesitate to attack if it were in her interest to
                        do so and if she felt that the other side was too weak to resist. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, in fact, blatantly said as
                        much in his statement of the 23rd of December.</p>
                    <p>The inability of the United Nations to prevent aggression has added to the
                        loss of public confidence in its efficacy.</p>
                    <p>We had decided to take our Kashmir case to the Security Council after the
                        Indian elections. In view of the recent developments, however, I have come
                        to the conclusion that to re-affirm our continued faith in the United
                        Nations, as the only force which might provide an alternative to naked
                        aggressions of the kind we have just witnessed, it is imperative that the
                        Kashmir question be raised now.</p>
                    <p>It is not our intention to ask the Council to discuss the substance of the
                        question at this stage. Our Permanent Representative will ask in the first
                        instance for a directive from the Security Council to the United Nations
                        Representative for India and Pakistan, Dr. <persName>Frank P.
                            Graham</persName>, to set forth his own views of what needs to be done
                        by Pakistan and by India to comply with the relevant resolutions of the
                        Security Council and of the United Nations Commission for India and
                        Pakistan. My Government regards this step as an essential preliminary move
                        without which the deadlock in the Kashmir question cannot be broken. We are
                        asking for this step to be taken about the middle of this month.</p>
                    <p>It is my understanding that a directive of the above kind can be given to Dr.
                            <persName>Graham</persName> without the adoption of a formal resolution
                        by the Security Council and the attendant risk of a Soviet veto, provided a
                        clear majority of the members of the Security Council express themselves in
                        favour of a directive for the reason that Dr. <persName>Graham</persName>'s
                        recommendations would enable them to appraise the present status of the case
                        correctly.</p>
                    <p>The details of this procedure will be explained by Ambassador Zafrulla Khan
                        to your Delegation in New York and by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1"

                    <p>I have been advised that the Presidency of the Security Council in February
                        1962 will be held by the United States. In view of the crucial role of the
                        President of the Council in the scheme of things that I have mentioned,
                        Pakistan places the utmost reliance on his goodwill and support <pb n="171"
                            xml:id="pg_171" facs="0197"/>to surmount the initial procedural

                        course of action of the Security Council.</p>
                    <p>I am confident, Mr. President, that you will appreciate the reasons for my
                        decision and that I may rely on your sympathetic understanding and fullest
                        support.</p>
                    <p>I cannot end this letter without expressing the gratitude of the people of
                        Pakistan, of their Government and my own sincere appreciation for the
                        consistent and unwavering support that has been extended by the United
                        States Government to Wilsonian principle of self-determination of peoples,
                        whether strong or weak, and for upholding the Purpose and Principles of the

                        that he had just received a message from Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> stating that he had informed the
                        Pakistan Foreign Minister of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s report that the Indians planned to approach the
                        Pakistanis with a view to arranging bilateral talks on the subject of
                        Kashmir, and that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had
                        appeared receptive to the idea.</p>
                    <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0198"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador mentioned his Government's plans to raise the Kashmir question
                        in the Security Council later in the month and said President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had appointed him a Special
                        Representative to visit Venezuela and Chile [whose representatives are
                        scheduled to preside over the Security Council in March and April].<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d84fn1">All brackets are in the source text.</note> The
                        Ambassador said he was planning to depart on the evening of January 9 but
                        [if this new development resulted in postponement of Pakistan action in the
                        Security Council] he might now be able to delay his departure.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary remarked that no serious talks were likely to occur during the
                        Indian elections, but that India and Pakistan had two almost legendary
                        debaters who would probably clash if the Kashmir matter were brought to the
                        Security Council. Smiling, the Ambassador said he did not know whether Sir
                            <persName>Zafrullah</persName> would like being compared with <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, but his Government had no
                        desire to embarrass <persName>Nehru</persName> during the Indian
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said his Government had instructed him to discuss with
                        the Secretary the post-Goa picture in South Asia as set forth in an
                        aide-memoire which he handed to the Secretary (copy attached).<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d84fn2">The aide-mémoire is summarized in <ref target="#d88"
                                >Document 88</ref>, but not printed.</note> The Ambassador offered
                        “a few words in explanation” of certain portions of the aide-memoire. He
                        emphasized India's inconsistency in using one justification for its
                        occupation of Junagadh and another justification for claiming all of Kashmir
                        and for occupying Hyderabad. He stressed his belief that India had no
                        intention of fighting Communist China and asked why, if India does intend to
                        fight Communist China, it does not settle its differences with Pakistan and
                        seek Pakistan's assistance. With reference to the United States military
                        sales agreement with India, the Ambassador said Pakistan did not want to
                        take an obstructionist position, and that Pakistan would go along with the
                        United States provided the United States and Pakistan were satisfied with
                        the bona fides of India's requests for military supplies and with India's
                        foreign policy. He said his Government believed there might be a
                        reconsideration of the quantum of aid if India is diverting most of its
                        foreign exchange for arms and is not making a proper effort to develop its
                        economy. He said India must be deterred from foreign adventures. He then
                        referred to the two requests in the aide-mémoire—for a public statement by
                        the United States, and for steps to increase Pakistan's strength—and added
                        that there might be “other courses”.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador whether he could comment further on his
                        impressions of agitation in India to take over Pakistan. The Ambassador said
                        “numerous statements” had been made and that <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                            facs="0199"/>extremist organizations, such as the Jan Sangh, were
                        gathering strength as Congress strength declined.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would like to comment in a very preliminary way on the
                        very important questions raised by the aide-mémoire. He said Goa and a
                        possible attack on Pakistan were two quite different things. He said if the
                        question of Goa had been taken into the General Assembly we would have
                        almost certainly have failed to succeed in our objective. As Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had pointed out, it was
                        true that the case involved “a double standard.” It was a muddled issue,
                        involving the question of colonialism, the U.K.'s commonwealth tie with
                        India and alliance with Portugal, and the obvious unwillingness of any
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to fight India over Goa. The
                        Secretary pointed out that the case of Pakistan was quite different. There
                        was no colonial issue, Pakistan had allies, and there was a United States
                        military presence in Pakistan. The situations were as different as night and
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that in the case of Goa, where the use of force was the
                        issue, India was able to get the sympathy of the Afro-Asian group. In the
                        case of Kashmir, the Soviets had said Kashmir belonged to India. The
                        Pakistanis feared they were no match for the Indians in the propaganda
                        field, and that the Indians could even make a case for an attack on
                        Pakistan. He said that in 1950 Indian troops were “poised for an attack on
                        East Pakistan” and it might have been just providential that the attack did
                        not materialize; but that when the Indians wanted “to make propaganda” they
                        told the Hindus in East Pakistan to move out as refugees, and the Hindus
                        followed these orders.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he could not imagine that the Government of India would
                        try to confuse people on the issue of an attack on Pakistan, or that the
                        Afro-Asian bloc would support India in this matter. The Secretary also
                        pointed out that the U.S.S.R. attitude on Goa had nothing to do with the
                        United States position. The Ambassador replied that if India decided to
                        attack Kashmir or Pakistan, the U.S.S.R. would welcome the confusion and
                        would presumably encourage India.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the Secretary observed that the Goan development might
                        well mean that India would be forced to consider how to work things out with
                        Pakistan. He asked the Ambassador to let him give the aide-memoire some
                        study and said he would see the Ambassador again.</p>

                    <p>436. Deeply appreciate quick and helpful holiday response by Department and
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> on question moving US
                        supplies out of Pakistan. It is therefore with more regret than usual that I

                    <p>Thinking it best we reserve a level for final negotiations, I asked <gloss

                        points on which our text was not acceptable. These were as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Failure of our note to refer specifically to their note.</item>

                            <item>Change from “US owned” to “US financed” goods in first sentence,

                            <item>Use of phrases “as far as is practical and financially feasible”

                        </list></p>
                    <p>It quite clear that <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> concern on all four
                        points based not on question of substance but upon their public position,
                        with eye on future Pakistan propaganda. It seemed, therefore, that points
                        two and three could be easily met, while points one and four presented more
                        difficulty. Use of word “proposed” was unfortunate. While it is true that
                            <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> note appears to “propose,” yet we
                        should not forget that this arises out of our previous proposal to move US
                        goods out of Pakistan with use American teams. Similarly, the difference
                        between US “owned” and “financed” goods is a technicality presenting no real
                        problem. <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> simply desires that no goods
                        under Afghan title be brought in under this agreement. This could be handled
                        by defining goods intended more specifically.</p>
                    <p>With Hannah, I saw <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> this morning in effort resolve
                        these difficulties and explained our disappointment that <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> had not seen fit accept simple text note
                        which I convinced Washington thought to be helpfully drafted. Told him I was
                        ready recommend Department drafting changes on points two and three which I
                        thought he would find satisfactory, adding, however, I had no leeway on
                        point one. If <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> insisted upon direct
                        acknowledgment their note, it would be incumbent upon us to take exception
                        to some of the phraseology of Afghan note. This I thought would not be
                        helpful, either in problem of <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0201"
                        />immediate movement of goods, or toward eventual solution transit problem.
                        I therefore proposed, with understanding it on ad referendum basis, the
                        following substitute paragraph to meet first three Afghan points, explaining
                        that closest link I could make between our note and theirs was a reference
                        in our note to same conversation mentioned in introductory paragraph Afghan
                        note: “The Embassy of the USA presents its compliments to the Royal Afghan
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has the honor to refer to the understandings
                        reached between His Royal Highness, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA1">Byroade</persName> on December 23,
                        regarding the movement into Afghanistan of US aid goods, presently in
                        Pakistan, and under the title of the Government of the USA or American or
                        other foreign contractors.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> said he would accept this redraft
                        to meet their first three points.</p>
                    <p>Discussion on point four above lasted about an hour. It was difficult for
                        some time to determine real basis his objection on this point which
                        obviously he considered important. It eventually became quite clear to both
                        Hannah and myself that his only valid objection was based on public
                        impression and fear of Pakistan propaganda. He reasons that the language in
                        US note would imply to Pakistanis that US applying pressure on Afghan by a
                        partial or veiled threat to limit its aid program as result use Iranian
                        route. This would be used by Pakistanis to Afghan disadvantage so as to
                        weaken Afghan position vis-a-vis Pakistan. He made one additional point in
                        this discussion. He said he had received report from Afghan trade delegation
                        in Tehran which indicated their negotiations so successful that he doubted
                        cost factors through Iran would henceforth be real problem for US. I said I
                        hoped this correct, but could not base today's negotiations upon this
                        factor. Nor could I accept it myself without substantiation.</p>
                    <p>When it became apparent that <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>
                        would accept none of the drafting compromises I suggested in effort meet his
                        problem re publication while still retaining our qualifications on use
                        Iranian route, and that further discussion along this line could only lead
                        to complete stalemate, I made what I had previously decided would be my
                        final fallback position for recommendation to Department. I asked for and
                        received, again, <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>'s assurance
                        that there was no misunderstanding in substance between us and that his
                        concern stemmed from public relations considerations. I then said I would
                        propose to Washington deletion these particular phrases from notes provided
                        he would agree with me to formal secret minute which would make it
                        absolutely certain there was no actual misunderstanding between governments.
                        Believe this procedure a new one for him, but he said he would entertain
                        idea and seek clearance his government as well if we could agree on wording.
                        Two hours later Hannah gave <persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> a
                        suggested text which I felt satisfactory for negotiating purposes. Text

                                January 3, 1962, American Ambassador explained it is intention

                                Afghanistan and, in doing so, to utilize route through Iran, giving
                                due consideration factors which, in absence actual experience,
                                cannot yet be fully defined. These factors concern question cost and

                                stated he understood this to be position <gloss target="#t_USG1"

                            <p>“It was further understood by both parties that this understanding
                                would remain secret but would become part of record in connection

                    <p>Upon receipt above draft, <persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> said
                        he had no authority discuss text but would deliver to Foreign Minister. It
                        was agreed that if Foreign Minister found text satisfactory, he would
                        present to his government and I would propose to Department. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> gave his personal opinion that
                            <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> would not approve the whole idea of
                        secret minute. Two hours later <persName corresp="#p_ENA1"
                            >Etemadi</persName> telephoned Hannah to say Foreign Minister had
                        concluded that text had only the barest minimum chance of being accepted and
                        that therefore I should not propose it to Department. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> made no proposals for modification,
                        and in answer to question replied that Foreign Minister did not feel he
                        could recommend acceptance to Afghan Govt. Subsequently, Hannah phoned
                            <persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName> at my instruction to ask
                        him relay my deep disappointment to Foreign Minister, my belief that we had
                        come more than half way to meet <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>
                        legitimate points particularly re publicity but had observed very little
                        inclination understand our problems, and finally that I was at loss how to
                        proceed since I had no new suggestions to offer.</p>
                    <p>It is too early to form final conclusions as to meaning this encounter. I
                        would not recommend at this time that US accede to Afghan demand. It is
                        possible that upon more mature consideration Foreign Minister will modify
                        his view and adopt more tractable attitude. I am not hopeful that this will
                        happen quickly since I suspect that his sudden change of action on the
                        secret minute concept resulted from a lunchtime consultation with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName>'s remarks to Hannah expressing
                        fear that Pakistanis might obtain access to secret minute suggest <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> may fear a leak to <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. Perhaps significantly, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> suggested at one stage this morning
                        that we await return Afghan delegation from Tehran in hope that terms
                        brought back from Tehran would suffice to obviate necessity for US to make
                        any qualifications re cost and feasibility.</p>

                    <p>By being explicit on our qualifications we are not motivated by desire exert
                        pressure on <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>. On the contrary, US efforts

                        constitutes formal agreement, Dept must not make commitment which in fact it
                        may not be able fulfill. For example, if Iranian route were to prove
                        impracticable for sustained heavy truck traffic, <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> would not wish to be accused of bad faith. Furthermore Dept
                        must consider Congressional reaction to unqualified commitment. <persName

                        legally and with Congress.</p>
                    <p>However Dept has concluded it could not agree publication our Note along with

                        could cause lengthy wrangle, Dept suggests press statement be issued by

                        concerning Iranian route since US not bound by <gloss target="#t_RGA1"

                        agrees to utilize its facilities to complete the movement of these goods.
                        The US stated that it is willing to utilize temporarily the transit route

                    <p>“The <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> wishes to emphasize that this

                                public, might cause Pakistan adopt uncooperative attitude.<note

                        the Afghan, Kashmir, and Indian problems have been apparent in the series of
                        exchanges the New Administration has had with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s main concerns are Pakistan's
                        position versus Afghanistan and especially India—he isn't really much
                        interested in the larger conflict in which we are involved. He patently
                        views his alliance with the US primarily as insurance against Indian and
                        Afghan threats, and as a means of leverage vis-à-vis
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Daud</persName>.</p>
                    <p>One can understand and sympathize with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s preoccupations. As the weaker power on the
                        subcontinent, fearful of eventual Indian attempts to reunify it, he sees a
                        need both for an aggressive stance and for an outside counterweight to
                        India. One can also sympathize with the Pakistan case on Kashmir and
                        Pushtunistan. But to the extent Ayub uses his alliance tie to push us into
                        supporting his forward policies vis-à-vis India and Afghanistan, he forces
                        us into a position which runs contrary to our larger strategic interests in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>And this is what he is trying to do. His “post-Goa” letter makes this
                        abundantly clear. I am well aware that we always try not to fall into this
                        trap, but in our very forthcoming policy toward Pakistan, and in our concern
                        lest we offend a staunch ally, do we lean over too far? I fear that in the
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> visit last July, and the
                        many exchanges since, we have failed to get across to him the limitations
                        on, as well as the benefits from our support. Instead he seems to have
                        gotten the feeling that we are so attached to him <pb n="180"
                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0206"/>as an ally that he can pursue his own aims
                        with renewed vigor, and drag us along with him. Whatever the merits of the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> case on Pushtunistan and Kashmir, it
                        is <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> who has taken the tactical
                        initiative on both issues. Now he wants us to lower the boom on India.
                        Meanwhile, we continue to shower him with favors (the latest a forthcoming
                        $500 million commitment to the consortium supporting his new development
                        plan).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">What do we get from our <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                            alliance?</hi> True, we get some highly important facilities, and I am
                        the last to deprecate their value. However, I'm not sure that we've gotten a
                        lot else from it so far, except a paper commitment to <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> on which it is hard to see how <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could effectively pay off in more than
                        peanuts.</p>
                    <p>I would presume that, broadly speaking, our strategic interest lies in having
                        a strong and stable subcontinent as a counterweight and counter-influence to
                        the Communists in Asia. Essentially, this goal requires us to ameliorate and
                        eventually dissipate the tensions between the countries within the
                        subcontinent, not only in our long-range interest but in the interest of
                        their own survival against a much larger threat. Thus, our aim must be to
                        resolve such disputes as Kashmir and Pushtunistan which essentially distract
                        and divert these countries from the goal we have in mind.</p>
                    <p>But if we must choose among these countries, there is little question that
                        India (because of its sheer size and resources) is where we must put our
                        chief reliance. True, the <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> regime
                        is far more “pro-Western” than the Indians (though it is questionable
                        whether most Pakistanis are really less neutralist than Indians). In any
                        event, are we more interested in a Western-oriented weak ally or a strong
                        neutralist India able to defend its own national interests (which happen to
                        broadly coincide with ours).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">What has moved India toward us in the last few years?</hi>
                        Essentially it isn't our policy or our increasing generosity in supporting
                        India's ambitious five-year plans. It is the Chinese pressures on the
                        northeast frontier. Over time, the conflict of interest between Peiping and
                        Delhi will almost certainly grow rather than decrease. And sooner or later
                        the Indians will come to realize that the arena of conflict is not only
                        along the Himalayas but in Southeast Asia as well.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Pakistan's chief preoccupation will long remain India.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s whole policy is built
                        around this central theme (as his post-Goa letter makes abundantly clear). I
                        question whether it is in our strategic interest to cater even indirectly to
                        his concerns, beyond reinsuring him against Indian attack.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Would <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> go
                            neutralist if we were tougher with him?</hi> I wonder. As the weaker
                        power on the subcontinent he needs external support. And where can he get
                        it? The Russians, no more than we, are going to give Pakistan priority over
                        India. Could the Chinese help much? In the last analysis, Pakistan needs the
                        U.S. connection more than we need it.</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0207"/>
                    <p>What I am leading up to is my growing conviction that we had better take a
                        new tack in our approach to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>.
                        Instead of showering him with consortium aid, instead of using kid gloves on
                        the Pak/Afghan transit issue, instead of letting ourselves be dragged along
                        on Kashmir, and instead of allowing him to think that he can continually get
                        more military aid from us to use against India, perhaps we had better give
                        him a clear idea of the limitations on our ability to come to his support.
                        Otherwise, we are simply storing up more and more trouble. If the objective
                        of our policy is to achieve compromise solutions on Pushtunistan, Kashmir
                        and related intra-<gloss target="#t_SOA1">SOA</gloss> disputes, we are going
                        to have to start leaning a bit more on one side or the other. Whatever the
                        merits of either side in the dispute, it is pretty clear where we'll have to
                        lean.</p>
                    <p>We should guard against regarding such disputes as Pushtunistan and Kashmir
                        as intractable quarrels which only time will solve. History suggests that
                        more often they flare up eventually into serious crises, especially when
                        agitated by an activist like <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                        >Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In sum, so many problems are piling up in our relations with Pakistan that
                        before we approve a new consortium which will involve some $500 million in
                        U.S. cash, perhaps we had better take a new look at our Pakistan
                        relationship and ask whether we are giving too much and not getting enough
                        in return. I urge we do this before we have played a hole card in firmly
                        committing ourselves to massive development aid.</p>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>Our political and economic policies are well-charted and reasonably
                        successful in strengthening the domestic structures of these countries.
                        Similarly, within the bounds of current capabilities, our general posture of
                        defense against Soviet bloc pressures in this region are not per se an
                        immediate cause of concern. The chief proximate threat to the success of our
                        policies in South Asia arise from the pervasive, corrosive intra-regional
                        disputes. In the end these troublesome controversies probably cannot be
                        greatly ameliorated either bilaterally or mainly through the influence of
                        the United Nations or other nations such as Britain; the United States must
                        continue to play a major role. The problem is what additional instruments we
                        should use to influence the governments concerned.</p>
                    <p>The policy issues we face immediately include the Afghan-Pakistan trade
                        impasse, the Pakistani intention of raising the Kashmir dispute in the
                        United Nations, the recent Pakistani requests and suggestions to the United
                        States that we restrict aid to India and give additional positive
                        reaffirmations of the U.S.-Pakistan alliance, suggestions emanating from
                        India that American arms would be welcome to increase India's capabilities
                        vis-a-vis the Communist Chinese, and the aftermath of the Goan invasion.</p>
                    <p>Compared with most states in Southeast and Southwest Asia, India and Pakistan
                        enjoy a relatively high degree of political stability and sustained economic
                        growth. India's size and strength, plus its historic role in the vanguard of
                        Asian nationalisms, give it the political influence with other countries
                        that can be damaging to the United States when India and the United States
                        are at cross purposes (as in some colonial issues) or extremely helpful when
                        we can cooperate (as in the Congo or, hopefully, in achieving peace and
                        security in Southeast Asia). India stands sometimes on the side of the Bloc,
                        sometimes on our side and always on its own side (Goa, Kashmir).</p>
                    <p>Pakistan, though less than a quarter as populous as India, politically and
                        economically behind the Indian pace and less influential with other
                        countries, ranks as another country of major importance to the United States
                        because of its location, size and policies. Its most important policy is its
                        alliance with the United States. From this it expects a place at the
                        councils of the free world, military and economic strengthening beyond the
                        usual level of aid for an unaligned nation of its size, and assured <pb
                            n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0209"/>American protection against India.
                        We expect the alliance to give us Pakistan's general support in the United
                        Nations, a South Asian anchor position for our system of pacts around the
                        rim of the Communist Bloc, and certain special facilities.</p>
                    <p>In general political terms India's weight in international affairs can do
                        more to help us or harm us than can Pakistan's. To have to choose between
                        the two countries would, however, be a failure of policy: we need both.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan is a traditional buffer area between Russia and South Asia. While
                        less important to the Free World than either India or Pakistan, for it to
                        come under Communist domination would greatly aggravate the problems of
                        defense for Iran as well as India and Pakistan. Its conflicts with Pakistan
                        over “Pushtunistan” and related problems are the single greatest threat to
                        its retention in the Free World.</p>
                    <p>The bitterest of the regional disputes in South Asia arises out of events in
                        the late 1940s. In the 1960s South Asia will face new and profoundly
                        different situations which can be met only if Afghanistan, Pakistan and
                        India perceive the necessity of much closer cooperation than they have ever
                        yet achieved. With economic development village economies are giving way to
                        regional cash economies; these can ripen far more effectively when trade and
                        exchange flow freely across the sub-continental borders. Economic
                        cooperation will also be essential to successfully meeting the competition
                        of the European Common Market. The advantages of close political cooperation
                        are self-evident. In military defense, joint or coordinated policies in the
                        face of the threat from the north will greatly strengthen each country, and
                        therefore the Free World generally.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, it is essential to our interests that these countries find ways of
                        compromising their bitter disputes. Hundreds of millions of dollars of our
                        aid to India and Pakistan are in effect dissipated by their feud over
                        Kashmir. The stability and strength that we need in South Asia as a
                        condition of our global defenses against Communist pressures is also
                        jeopardized. To overcome these difficulties and to settle these disputes it
                        may be necessary for the United States to undertake further new initiatives.
                        It is also essential to United States global security interests that we
                        maintain in these countries an image of strength, and of determination to

                    <p>In our dealings with South Asian governments we must bear in mind the fact
                        that individual leaders and oligarchies can exert tremendous influence on
                        millions of constituents. The importance of personal diplomacy cannot be
                        overestimated. In our discussions with South Asian leaders it is important
                        that we keep them aware of United States interests in the area; that we
                        impress them with our disapproval of their self-destructive squabbles; and
                        that we constantly remind them of the <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184"

                    <p>The intra-area disputes confront us, with several direct, immediate policy
                        issues. These are discussed in the following paragraphs:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. Pakistan-Afghanistan Disputes</hi></p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">“Pushtunistan”</hi></p>
                    <p>The “Pushtunistan” question continues to affect directly every aspect of
                        Afghanistan-Pakistan relations and United States relations with both
                        countries. Pakistan flatly rejects the Afghan claim that for historical,
                        ethnic, cultural and linguistic reasons Afghanistan has a special interest
                        in the four to five million Pushtu-speaking peoples in Pakistan and that
                        these people should be given the right of self-determination. In the last
                        two years the Government of Pakistan has dealt increasingly firmly with
                        Pushtun tribal unrest and relations between the two countries have
                        correspondingly worsened. There is little likelihood of a solution of the
                        “Pushtunistan” question in the foreseeable future. Pakistan has a strong
                        legal position. Most nations, including the United States, recognize the
                        Durand Line as the international boundary.</p>

                        establish conditions of mediation for this dispute.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that we not do so, but continue to work toward the obsolescence
                        of this problem through resolution of the associated transit trade issue, on
                        which we may have more leverage.</p>

                    <p>The complex of actions and counter actions which led to the disruption of the
                        traditional transit trade route through Pakistan into Afghanistan in
                        September has opened the door for rapidly and sharply increased Soviet
                        influence in Afghanistan. Because a substantial part of the transit trade
                        consists of United States aid supplies and equipment (which we ship to
                        Afghanistan with ample political as well as economic justification) we
                        believe we have some leverage with Afghanistan, though very little with
                        Pakistan except at the possible cost of a degeneration in our relations with
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Policy Issues:</hi> (a) Whether we should make efforts to
                        keep the aid pipeline open to Afghanistan if it can be done at moderate
                        extra costs for shipments by a temporary alternative routing through
                        Iran.</p>
                    <p>We believe this should be done and that it is desirable to add the necessary
                        amount to the Afghan aid bill to continue the movement of selected aid goods
                        to Afghanistan. This will indicate to the Afghans our intention of
                        continuing a portion of our aid programs while the Pakistan route is closed.
                        At the same time we recommend that after the Afghans and Pakistanis have had
                        an opportunity to realize the dangerous consequences of their stubborn
                        positions, we make a new diplomatic approach.</p>

                        for Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>This issue will become acute if the trade impasse shows no significant
                        prospects of improvement over the next one or two years. We recommend no
                        immediate action in support of the development of a permanent alternative
                        route for the reason that it would release Afghanistan from pressures for
                        seeking a resolution of its issue with Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>If Pakistan, as it now intends, raises the Kashmir issue in the Security
                        Council in January we can expect a deterioration in the relations between
                        the two countries and a setback in prospects of progress toward the
                        resolution of this overriding issue between Pakistan and India. Possibly
                        even more important, the United Nations debate and the position the United
                        States takes with respect to the issue in that forum probably could lead to
                        a noticeable deterioration of United States relations with one or the other
                        of the two countries.</p>
                    <p>Tension between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has risen markedly in recent
                        weeks. India's seizure of Goa by force, and the inability of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to prevent this, has raised Pakistan fears
                        that India may have in mind the eventual forceful seizure of
                        Pakistan-occupied portions of Kashmir. The Goa action has also served to
                        embarrass India internationally with Western nations. The initial Pakistan
                        reaction to Goa was to advance the prospective date for presentation of
                        Kashmir in the Security Council to mid-January. At the same time, Indian
                        leaders, in the normal course of their election campaign, have been calling
                        for the return to India of the portion of the state of Kashmir which
                        Pakistan now occupies.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, following Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s initiative, he and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWM1">Rountree</persName> have been quietly attempting to
                        stimulate ministerial-level talks between India and Pakistan which would
                        hopefully lead to <persName>Nehru</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> talks after the Indian elections in February. (If
                        Pakistan adopts a constitution this winter, the top-level talks would
                        probably have to follow Pakistan elections in the spring.) At the same time
                        we have been making representations in both Karachi and New York with the
                        Pakistan representative in New York and giving the reasons why we believe
                        submission to the Security Council would be of no value to Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>No progress toward a solution of the Kashmir problem is seen possible through
                        Security Council action. Any resolution putting pressure on India would
                        receive a Soviet veto. This the Pakistanis know, but they seem to feel that
                        drawing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attention again to the problem
                        would at least draw world attention to India's intransigence and might serve
                        as a form of pressure on India towards concessions in eventual bilateral
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>Clearly no final political solution of the Kashmir dispute is presently
                        possible or in view in the near future. At the same time, other aspects of
                        the Kashmir problem—hydrological, economic, humanitarian, military—appear as
                        possible subjects of bilateral talks in the present context when it seems
                        impossible totally to avoid consideration of the Kashmir issue.</p>

                    <p>We should impress upon both parties that their failure to settle traditional

                        importance to their future security and that of the Free World, but also
                        jeopardizing the interests of countries outside the area desiring to assist

                    <p>On point (b), we should point out that the United States provides no hard
                        currency support to India which she could directly apply to military
                        purchases and that all of our economic assistance is involved in specified
                        projects or commodity purchases. In our opinion India would spend
                        approximately the same amount of its own resources on its armed forces, in
                        the light of its security interests as it sees them, regardless of the level
                        of United States and other aid. The sacrifice would fall in the economic

                    <p>Since 1951 we have sold to India relatively small quantities of military
                        equipment—mainly consumable or replacement items. The Indians have recently
                        shown an interest in the purchase of aircraft, missiles and electronic
                        devices, the sale of which would generate protests from Pakistan, and at the
                        same time help to prevent the Indians from turning to the Bloc for similar
                        items.</p>
                    <p>Since Goa we have informally suspended active consideration of possible sales
                        of major military items to India. This question, of course, involves
                        agreement among a number of Departments and agencies.</p>

                    <p>On January 11, 1962, Pakistan requested a meeting of the U.N. Security
                        Council to consider further action concerning the dispute between India and
                        Pakistan over Kashmir. In a letter to the President of the Security Council,
                        Pakistan stated that it was forced to request the meeting because efforts to
                        develop direct negotiations with India on the issue had failed, and recent
                        public statements by Indian officials had exacerbated the dispute. (U.N.
                        Document S/5058)</p>
                    <p>India responded, in a January 16 letter to the President of the Security
                        Council, that the Council should refuse to comply with Pakistan's request.
                        India stated that, contrary to Pakistani allegations, avenues for direct
                        negotiations concerning Kashmir were always open. Pakistan, India argued,
                        was trying to exploit the Council as a propaganda forum on the eve of
                        India's general elections. (U.N. Document S/5060)</p>
                    <p>Pakistan repeated its request for a Security Council meeting in another
                        letter to the President of the Security Council on January 29. (U.N.
                        Document S/5068) The Security Council met in response to Pakistan's requests
                        on February 1. After listening to divergent statements on the Kashmir issue
                        by Sir <persName>Muhammad Zafrulla Khan</persName>, Pakistan's Permanent

                        the Council decided to postpone further consideration of the problem until

                            which had been pending for a long time would be a good thing to start

                            so much aid going to India and Pakistan, in contrast to Latin America,
                            for example. He directed a restudy to determine whether we could tighten
                            up and increase interest rates on long term development loans. The
                            purpose would be to make it easier to sell larger aid programs on the
                            Hill, recognizing that we wouldn't actually get the money back anyway in
                            many cases. However, we shouldn't worry about problems <pb n="191"

                        <item>Pakistan and Transit Trade. The President was very reluctant to agree
                            to the extra outlays ($150 a ton as opposed to $50) required to ship aid
                            goods to Afghan over temporary Iranian route. He could not see why we
                            should pay extra to ship what was after all aid to the Afghans. He
                            agreed to the eight week moratorium proposal permitting US aid goods
                            already in Pakistan to go forward by the direct route but reserved
                            judgment on the Iran route. When Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> pointed out that Afghans would
                            not accept moratorium proposal unless we agreed also to go ahead with
                            subsequent shipments via Iran route, the President's inclination was to
                            let them stew, and tell them that Congress would not accept such a huge
                            increase in transport costs. However, he reluctantly accepted Talbot's
                            plea that we take a gamble for a few months, using a quarter of the
                            estimated $2 million it would take to ship the remainder of our aid over
                            the Iranian route during 1962.</item>

                        through Iran to Afghanistan while Kabul and Rawalpindi maintain adamant
                        positions. It is hoped this concession can be justified on ground it is in

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister: You know of my deep concern over relations between
                        Pakistan and India and my firm conviction that peace and progressive
                        development for the people of Asia require a resolution of problems as
                        between these two countries. These problems, and particularly that of
                        Kashmir, are difficult. But in the last fifteen years numerous and important
                        issues between Pakistan and India have been resolved. It would surely be a
                        tragic error of pessimism to assume that nothing can ever be accomplished on
                        the one major problem that now remains. Above all it would be a misfortune
                        if the search for solution by the statesmen most concerned were at any stage
                        to be impeded by the desire of anyone else to exploit controversy for its
                        own sake.</p>
                    <p>In recent months I have talked with the leaders of both countries. It is my
                        sincere belief, influenced I do not doubt by my feelings of friendship for
                        both heads of state, that a real possibility of accommodation does exist.
                        This possibility will not be served by public debate and recrimination. It
                        can be served by patient and continuing discussion and negotiation. In this
                        effort the United States willingly proposes the services of a good and
                        sympathetic friend. We have a deep and active concern for the peace and
                        development of both countries and we cannot be without interest in the
                        external dangers which they face in common. So I am writing to inquire
                        whether you would be willing to request a trusted friend of both countries—I
                        have in mind Mr. Eugene Black of the International Bank for Reconstruction
                        and Development, who would be prepared to respond to such a request—to
                        explore with each head of government the outlines and prospects for
                        negotiations and discussions which hopefully might lead to a final
                        resolution of this troubled and contentious matter. If you agree to this
                        approach, I would, of course, expect that other steps which would work
                        against, rather than for, a solution—including an appeal to the Security
                        Council of the United Nations—would be suspended. And I would also hope
                        that, in a spirit of reconciliation, responsible <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195"
                            facs="0221"/>leaders on both sides might avoid work or action that would
                        be prejudicial to the settlement we seek.</p>

                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>, I believe following observations may
                        help remove any misunderstanding our position.</p>
                    <p>In our strenuous efforts serve Afghan and American interests by keeping aid
                        flowing to Afghanistan despite troublesome Pak-Afghan dispute, we have never
                        been willing to let Afghanistan use these efforts for propaganda advantage
                        against Pakistan or vice versa. We object to being associated with
                        publication of Afghan note only because terms “illegal” and “Pakistan and
                        Peshawar, Chaman and Quetta” carry legal meaning which we cannot accept.
                        Afghanistan's insistence on retaining these terms has increasingly suggested
                        to us Afghans intend use them propagandistically. Therefore we cannot now
                        agree to joint publication notes if these terms remain.</p>

                    <p>We have no other objection to the Afghan note. We would agree publication of
                        notes jointly if these terms deleted or we would agree to other alternative
                        procedures specified below. Our prime immediate object remains to get border
                        open so aid goods now in Pakistan can be moved directly into

                        me at length and in personal vein on the Goan matter.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d95fn1">See <ref target="#d77fn1">footnote 1, Document
                            77</ref>.</note> Your letter, incidentally, was delayed in transmittal
                        and it reached my desk only in the last few days.</p>
                    <p>You have my sympathy on the colonial aspects of this issue. There is, I am
                        sure, a feeling in your part of the world that this is a matter we do not
                        quite understand. I believe we do understand. Sometimes, perhaps, we are
                        inclined to talk a little too unctuously about the colonial origins of the
                        United States, now nearly two centuries in the past. But, like many others,
                        I grew up in a community where the people were barely a generation away from
                        colonial rule. And I can claim the company of most historians in saying that
                        the colonialism to which my immediate ancestors were subject was more
                        sterile, oppressive, and even cruel than that of India. The legacy of Clive
                        was on the whole more tolerable than that of Cromwell.</p>
                    <p>But I should like to say a word about the more immediate issue, that of the
                        effect of the Goan episode on the relations between our two countries. It
                        has not been good, but there may be useful lessons from the experience.</p>
                    <p>One difficulty was, of course, that the action followed so soon after your
                        visit. I had naturally hoped that the candor of our exchange might have
                        extended to all of the problems with which we were mutually concerned. I
                        confess to a feeling that we should have discussed this problem; it is at
                        least possible that if we had talked about it, our efforts to help prevent a
                        solution by force could have been more helpful.</p>
                    <p>I have also been disturbed by the chain effect of this action on other parts
                        of the world. Public opinion does not easily differentiate between the use
                        of troops for good and bad purposes. And all countries, including of course
                        the United States, have a great capacity for convincing themselves of the
                        full righteousness of their particular cause. No country ever uses force for
                        reasons it considers unjust.</p>
                    <p>Probably we should be glad of the existence of this adverse reaction,
                        discriminating or otherwise, to the setting of armies in motion. We both
                        want a world in which disputes are settled and oppression is ended by
                        alternative means; it is good that on this matter opinion is with us. I fear
                        that the episode in Goa will make it harder to hold the line for peace in
                        other places.</p>
                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0224"/>
                    <p>But my major concern was and continues to be the effect of the action on our
                        joint tasks, especially in terms of its impact on American opinion.
                        Unfortunately the hard, obvious fact for our people was the resort to
                        force—and by India. This was a shock to the majority who have admired your
                        country's ardent advocacy of peaceful methods, and a reinforcement to those
                        who did not enjoy what they called “irresponsible lectures.” Moreover, the
                        action occurred at a time when our joint efforts in the Congo were subject
                        to especially harsh criticism here and it added a new dimension of
                        criticism. Critics asked how we could claim to work with you for peace in
                        the Congo while force was being used by you in Goa. The action brought also
                        some setback for our efforts to develop the strength of the United Nations
                        and confidence in its effectiveness. In the next few weeks, as we seek
                        authorization by the Congress to purchase the bonds of the United Nations, I
                        fear we shall hear a good deal about the failure to find a non-violent
                        solution in Goa. Yet the finances of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        depend upon this action in our Congress.</p>
                    <p>There is also the problem of aid appropriations. This, I should make clear,
                        is not a question of strings; nothing could be farther from my thought than
                        to make our assistance to India Contingent on her acceptance of our
                        particular wishes in foreign or domestic policy We seek to help develop
                        independence, and independence exists to be used. Still we must both weigh
                        the effects of action by one country on public opinion and political action
                        in the other. We both lead countries that are not easily governed. You are
                        justified in asking that American action be considerate of the problems of
                        Indian democracy. I should not willingly do anything to make your problems
                        more difficult—shall hope, when something bears on Indian public opinion, to
                        consider this closely, and to be informed if I am ever indifferent.
                        Similarly I think it is reasonable that American public opinion should be a
                        subject of concern to you. Each year our appropriations to help, not India
                        alone, but also the other developing countries of the world, involve our
                        most difficult political battle. This aid is of prime importance—to help
                        countries to independence, to show compassion for the less fortunate, to
                        ease the strains and passions that arise from poverty. I hope that you will
                        agree that we have a common concern in maintaining the political atmosphere
                        and the public attitudes that are sympathetic to this effort. If India had
                        large-scale aid programs to other countries, would you not face a similar
                        problem if one of those countries should adopt a course of armed action? And
                        what is worse is that these difficulties spread out and affect not just one
                        country, but the whole principle of disinterested aid.</p>
                    <p>You and I stand for cooperation and understanding, but not all our countrymen
                        agree with us—and some of them would like nothing better than to see our
                        hopes disappointed. It is not an accident that the men who are taking most
                        advantage of the Goa matter here are the same men who <pb n="199"
                            xml:id="pg_199" facs="0225"/>are already attacking our aid programs and
                        our support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They are also the men
                        who would noisily advocate certain armed adventures by the United States. I
                        hate to see our common purposes impeded in this way.</p>
                    <p>I feel, Mr. Prime Minister, that you would wish me to write you candidly of
                        matters as I see them. I do so in no mood of self-righteousness, and with no
                        feeling that our own policy is above reproach. Indeed, I trust that you will
                        continue to make clear in equal candor your views on matters of common
                        concern. Meanwhile, you can count on me to do all that I can to ensure that
                        any damage to our common interests is temporary. Good and fruitful relations
                        with India have been a matter of great concern to me for many years, and I
                        have taken satisfaction in the progress we were making together before this
                        episode. I believe we can and must get back on this high road, and I shall
                        work steadily toward this end.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2"

                        at this post on Thursday morning. Hannah and I saw <persName

                    <p>Certainly agree that first alternative proposed by Department preferable
                        solution and ordinarily would have been prepared stick at this as
                        negotiating tactic in first meeting. However, in view of several local
                        factors, including deplorable state situation as regards our contractors,
                        decided to seek complete agreement today if at all possible. Following
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>'s negative reaction
                        successively to proposals contained in paragraphs A and B of <gloss
                            target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 260, I therefore proceeded to that of
                        paragraph C. Based on broad authority given me by your telegram, I have
                        reached agreement with <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> along following
                        lines: <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> note will be published and our
                        reply will remain confidential. In finally agreeing to this alternative, I
                        insisted upon change in last substantive paragraph of <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> note, as felt we should not accept phrase
                        “on receipt of confirmative reply to this note” as this would imply that
                        confirmation reply to entire contents had been made on behalf <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, whether privately or publicly. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> agreed to following substitution: “on

                        etc.” It seems to me that this is acceptable from our point of view as it in
                        effect excludes our association from objectionable phrases <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> note and does not even indicate our reply
                        given in write up. Of far less importance, the words “the traditional route
                        of” were inserted between the words “through” and “Pakistan” in second
                        paragraph Afghan note. The commencement date in numbered paragraph three was
                        changed to January 29.</p>
                    <p>The text of our note remains in substance the same except for slight
                        modification first sentence paragraph 2 which now reads as follows: <quote

                        reasons or for assistance in translation. Order that exact text be

                    <p>“Dear Mister President,</p>
                    <p>Please accept my sincere thanks for your message of January 15,<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d97fn1">See <ref target="#d93fn1">footnote 1, Document
                            93</ref>.</note> on the Kashmir issue.</p>
                    <p>I would also like to express to you my gratitude for the deep concern and
                        interest that you have shown over the relations between Pakistan and India
                        and the efforts that you have been personally making to bring about
                        negotiations between the two countries to relieve the dispute, which is, as
                        you have truly said, the one major problem that now remains between the two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>I entirely agree with you that it would be a tragic error to assume that this
                        problem cannot be settled. I do not think I should tire you by setting forth
                        the efforts that I have been making during the last three years to persuade
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> to enter into
                        direct negotiations with me, to find an equitable and realistic solution of
                        the Kashmir dispute. At no time, however, have I had any assurance that the
                        Indian leader was ready to enter into discussions with me except on his own
                        terms.</p>
                    <p>You have inquired whether I would be willing to request a trusted friend of
                        both India and Pakistan—Mister <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Eugene
                            Black</persName>—to explore with Mister <persName>Nehru</persName> and
                        myself, the prospects for negotiations and discussions which might lead to a
                        final solution of the problem. I am deeply grateful to you for this
                        constructive initiative and I welcome it as yet another manifestation of the
                        deep concern of the United States and yourself personally for the peaceful
                        existence and well-being of the peoples of the sub-continent.</p>
                    <p>I know Mister Black to be a man of high stature in international life and as
                        a statesman who has given proof of his talents for mediation and
                        conciliation.</p>
                    <p>While my final answer to your inquiry must necessarily be formulated after
                        taking into consideration Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName>'s reactions, I consider your offer to assist in
                        negotiations between Pakistan and India by making available the good offices
                        of a trusted statesman of international prestige as one that I could readily
                        accept.</p>
                    <p>You have said that if I agree with the approach to the Kashmir problem
                        suggested by you, you would expect that the appeal of Pakistan to the
                        Security Council would be suspended. I must, of course, attach the utmost
                        weight and importance to any suggestion that you feel it necessary to make.
                        At the same time, may I assure you that the decision of my government to
                        make the appeal has been prompted solely with a view to ending the
                        intolerable impasse in which the question of self-determination <pb n="203"
                            xml:id="pg_203" facs="0229"/>of the people of Kashmir has become
                        embedded for the past 13 years.</p>
                    <p>There is another consideration of a basic nature which is at the back of our
                        appeal to the Security Council. The political independence and territorial
                        integrity of Pakistan, and indeed its very existence, have never been free
                        from threat by India. Confident of its growing strength and encouraged by
                        the failure of the world to thwart its successful recourse to force in the
                        past, our colossal neighbor has become more emboldened than ever to proclaim
                        its aggressive intentions towards Pakistan. Since the danger of an armed
                        attack by India is real and ever present to us, Pakistan is under the
                        obligation and has indeed the right to invoke the political and moral
                        protection of the United Nations. in the attempt to safeguard its security.
                        It would be neither wise nor statesmanlike, for comparatively small
                        countries like Pakistan, to discard the instrumentality of the United
                        Nations whenever they feel themselves threatened by more powerful neighbors.
                        Therefore, our motivation in appealing to the Security Council flows from
                        our deep concern for the future of our country, and from our anxiety to
                        guard against a mounting threat to its very existence. That this threat has
                        become more grave and imminent is manifest not only from the recent
                        statements of the Indian Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, Mister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, and the President
                        of the Ruling Congress Party, Mister Sanjiva Reddy, but also from the fact
                        that 85 percent of the Indian Armed Forces, including their armoured
                        formations, are now concentrated within striking distance of our borders.
                        This situation is causing grave concern in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>I hope you appreciate that in the circumstances suspending our proposed
                        action in the Security Council at this stage would shock public opinion in
                        Pakistan and provoke severe criticism as [of] the value of our present
                        alignments. This is scarcely desirable, particularly at this time when we
                        are about to introduce our constitution.</p>
                    <p>The Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations is an eminent
                        statesman and I have no doubt that insofar as his interventions in the
                        Security Council are concerned, they will rise above the level of mere
                        controversy and recrimination.</p>

                    <p>I have made the determination requested by you in your memorandum of January
                        18, 1962<note n="1" xml:id="d98fn1">Not found.</note> with respect to the
                        Pakistan Second Five-Year Plan. In it you are authorized to make a pledge at
                        the forthcoming Pakistan Consortium meeting which would bring our
                        contribution up to $500 million out of the $945 million needed by Pakistan,
                        subject to a number of conditions. One of these conditions is that pledges
                        from other Consortium members must be sufficient to assure that the target
                        will be substantially met.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">The conditions
                            established by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            were met when the Pakistan consortium reconvened in Washington on
                            January 24, under the auspices of the International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development. The consortium, which had initiated
                            consideration of Pakistan's development plan in June 1961, endorsed
                            Pakistan's request for $945 million in aid for the years 1961/1962 and
                            1962/1963. Of the $945 million, the United States committed to provide
                            $500 million. (Telegram 1496 to Karachi, January 26; Department of

                    <p>I am concerned at the prospect that the total amount of the pledges as
                        indicated so far may be insufficient to meet the agreed upon target, since a
                        failure to provide what competent analysts have determined to be Pakistan's
                        needs would seriously weaken the image of the United States and the West as
                        determined to advance the development of our staunchest partners. In the
                        event that a shortfall threatens, therefore, I would like you to consult
                        with me immediately in order to determine what steps may best be taken.</p>

                        <persName>Ahmed</persName> expressed Pakistan's heightened fears of India's
                        aggressive intentions against Pakistan-held portions Kashmir and Pakistan
                        itself. Citing recent statements by Jha, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"

                            <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> argued <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> believes that prospective Soviet veto would protect it
                        against adverse Security Council action and that Allies would be fearful of
                        coming to Pakistan's aid if latter attacked lest general nuclear war result.
                        Emphasized that Pakistan has always felt India to be aggressive. President,
                        questioning validity of these views, pointed out that for India Pakistan is
                        very different matter from Goa. Goa action over in 24 hours; no one thinks
                        India could deal with Pakistan that way.</p>

                    <p>Pak had suggested (1) US terminate 1951 military sales agreement with India,
                        since India violated agreement by Goa aggression; (2) US review quantum of
                        aid to India, which at present levels (along with aid from other Western
                        countries) frees India's entire foreign exchange earnings for military
                        purchases and other domestic needs outside development program; (3) public
                        restatement of past assurances that US would come to Pakistan's aid if it
                        attacked; and (4) stepped up military assistance to strengthen Pakistan
                        against Indian threat. Amplifying these requests, <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                            >Amb</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> would not oppose
                        future US military aid to India if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>

                        seriously intend take on ChiComs. He urged importance of deterrent actions
                        because any new fighting over Kashmir would not be localized. To contrary,
                        it would become total war between India and Pakistan involving not only
                        armed forces but massacres of Muslim minority in India and doubtless
                        reprisals against Hindu minority in Pakistan. Ambassador said <gloss

                        as whole since neither India nor Pakistan can withstand Sino-Soviet Bloc

                        as unduly pessimistic in appraising apparent Indian intentions since it is

                    <p>President replied he not persuaded that likelihood of an attack by India was
                        demonstrated by Goa action or by statements cited by <gloss target="#t_Amb1"
                            >Amb</gloss>, even though we all know <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Krishna Menon</persName> and what he is like. Our concern with Indo-Pak
                        dispute has led us, however, to suggest that Eugene Black might make helpful
                        contribution. If both countries accept him, we hopeful of results though
                        unlikely Black could do much till after Indian elections. <gloss
                            target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> responded that Pakistan welcomes this
                        suggestion though not very optimistic about its success because of India's
                        apparent lack of desire to settle Kashmir issue.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> told President Pakistan public has
                        noticed that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has repeatedly given public
                        assurance to India of American support if Pakistan should attack India but
                        has given no comparable public assurances to Pakistan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> intervened to explain assurances to
                        India based on condition that if US aid to Pakistan is misused and directed
                        against another country in aggression US would take appropriate action to
                        thwart such aggression. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> agreed this
                        initial official <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> statement but said some
                        US spokesman in years past had omitted that condition and given India full
                        assurances. He added Pakistan knows <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                        acting from highest motives and that Pakistan and US desires are the same,
                        but believed public assurances to Pakistan now would have helpfully
                        deterrent effect on Indian leadership.</p>
                    <p>President expressed our deep concern that full effects US aid siphoned off
                        into disputes between two countries. Said we feel our aid goes down drain;
                        that is why we suggested Black mission. Added we have no evidence that
                        Indo-Pak situation now likely to degenerate into war.</p>

                            Pakistan had used what influence it had with the other members of the

                            economic development plans for fiscal years 1962-1963. If those

                        asking <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to take sides but only to support
                        right of self-determination of peoples and let that right be exercised in
                        Kashmir. Pakistan fully aware of the need to settle disputes with India and
                        anxious to do so. Pakistani people uneasy, how-ever, because impression been
                        given that US reaction to Goa was a directive to New Delhi saying that
                        because India vital to US there will be no change in US policy toward India.
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> public also worried by reports US
                        pressing Pakistan not go to Security Council. President said he is not aware
                        of any special directive but of course we wish to continue friendly
                        relationship with India as well as with Pakistan. As for Security Coun- cil
                        hearing of the Kashmir case the Pakistan Govt knows our attitude full
                        well.</p>
                    <p>On self-determination of peoples President commented that we don't have power
                        to enforce <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions unilaterally nor
                        would Pakistan expect us to. On Goa, he said, US opinion is clear and will
                        have an effect on our relationship with India for a long time. He thought
                        Goa action could affect our entire aid program. Ambassador commented that
                        consequences of Goa not merely economic, though that could be important
                        Graver situation is fact that bulk of both India and Pakistan's armies are
                        concentrated against each other and consequently immobilized against greater
                        threat from north.</p>
                    <p>President noted that Ambassador had been somewhat critical of <gloss
                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policies, at least by implication, but he
                        sure Ambassador recognizes we are not always able to persuade others to do
                        the things we wish, as for example our difficulty in persuading Pakistan of
                        the rightness of our views on such matters as Red China, Afghanistan and
                        Security Council action. <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> answered that
                        on Chinese representation Pakistan had virtually eaten its words, despite
                        promises to support Chinese Communist admission this year. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had instructed Pakistan delegation at
                        our request to vote for Chinese representation as “important issue.”
                        President <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0234"/>said he was thinking
                        specifically of over-all issue of Chinese representation, but in generally
                        merely wanted to point out that even its friends do not always see eye to
                        eye with US, though US and Pakistan do pretty well together. Expressed his
                        pleasure that <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> had come to see him and
                        said he would consider <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>'s comments though
                        he thought <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> now pretty well understood

                                permit small offices officially designated as Freight Forwarding
                                Offices be opened in Peshawar and Quetta manned by Afghan officials
                                with consular status but not designated as consuls. In granting

                                functioned mutually satisfactorily for reasonable length of
                                time—e.g., six months—they would be expanded to perform full
                                consular services and redesignated consulates with freight
                                forwarding sections. Trade agencies as previously constituted, would
                                never be reopened, and all functions would be integrated in one
                                office. Again providing everything went smoothly, after reasonable

                        better balance between economic and military aid. Discussion then shifted to

                        that such a meeting would be helpful. He then noted that the Kashmir problem
                        impinged on the broader subject of US-Indian relations. The Ambassador said
                        that the major positive factor working for an improvement in relations
                        between the United States and India is American economic aid to India.
                        However, the appreciation for this assistance was more on an intellectual
                        level and actions on an emotional level frequently had a greater impact on
                        relations between countries.</p>
                    <p>At the emotional level, in his judgment, there were two factors working
                        against improved US-Indian relations. One was of a temporary nature and the
                        other of a longer-run nature. He stated that the temporary reaction in the
                        United States and in Western Europe against the takeover of Goa by India was
                        being widely misinterpreted in India. Indian public opinion is virtually
                        unanimous in the conviction that the Indian action with respect to Goa was
                        right, and the adverse reaction in the United States and Western Europe was
                        being interpreted as support for colonialism. The longer-run problem was the
                        image in the Indian public mind that the United States was giving
                        preferential treatment to Pakistan and the United States through its
                        military support to Pakistan has caused a diversion of Indian resources to
                        defense. This latter problem is further complicated by Kashmir and the
                        Pakistani actions on this subject in the Security Council. The Indian public
                        has the image of United States support to Pakistan on this issue and of
                        Soviet support to India. Furthermore, the Ambassador concluded, as matters
                        now stand, India needs the support of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> veto in the Security Council on Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that while we do not support Pakistan per se as a
                        matter of principle in the Security Council on Kashmir, we are aware of the
                        problems that the raising of this issue in the Security Council causes for
                        us and that is a major reason for our reluctance to see the issue debated in
                        the United Nations. On the question of military assistance to Pakistan, the
                        President said it would be better in many ways if all our aid to Pakistan
                        were in the form of economic assistance as it is to India. However, this is
                        not possible for a number of reasons, a major one being that the Executive
                        Branch cannot get enough money out of Congress for economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that the reactions in this country on Goa have been
                        intensified by the preacher role adopted by India on many international
                        issues, and by <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> in
                        particular. He said, also, that we <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0241"
                        />are in a very difficult position with Portugal because of our statements
                        on Angola and Goa. He noted that the Azores was the site of extremely
                        important facilities for the United States and there were many in the United
                        States who could not understand our jeopardizing such vital facilities for
                        such apparently remote issues as Angola. He thought that the reaction on Goa
                        was now becoming gradually a matter of the past in the United States and
                        hoped that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>'s trip to
                        India would serve as a major antidote there.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that his government had noted and was appreciative of
                        the President's public stance on Goa. His Government also recognized the
                        importance of the Azores facilities to the United States. He expressed the
                        hope that the President and his staff could allay the adverse Congressional
                        reaction to the Goa takeover. The President said it would be most helpful
                        with Congress if <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> would
                        tone down his statements and actions which create such resentment here.</p>
                    <p>The President then stated that we would like nothing better than to withdraw
                        from South Vietnam and return to the Geneva Accords but this would be
                        possible only if North Vietnam would withdraw from South Vietnam. As it now
                        stands, we have no alternative to our present military support and cannot
                        disengage until we see the situation improve in Laos and South Vietnam. He
                        stated that we are conscious of the dangers involved in the steps we are now
                        taking in South Vietnam, but we are also conscious of the dangers of
                        non-action.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of United States resumption of nuclear testing, the President
                        stated a decision was imminent. He noted that unless the Soviets are willing
                        to sign a test treaty of the type presented in April we have no alternative
                        but to resume testing. In response to the Ambassador's question as to
                        whether such tests by the United States were necessary for military
                        purposes, the President replied strongly in the affirmative.</p>

                        had advocated these commitments as essential offset to Soviet pressure,
                        others had feared they might upset regional balance. Any event commitments
                        had been made and must be honored although relative emphasis on economic and

                        Afghan devotion to independence and neutrality and hard lessons of Afghan
                        history. Alluding to current problem re transit, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> discussed in general terms possible Iranian routes

                        while he knew every effort would be made ensure US money would be well
                        spent, there was concern in US over large number Russians in Afghanistan.
                        Stated US does not desire enter bidding game against Soviets. Gave personal
                        conviction that although Afghans have no intention of permitting Soviets

                    <p>4. My overriding impression was of tremendously increased Indian
                        self-confidence, both in economic field and vis-a-vis China. Country is
                        moving forward in economic field rapidly; increased decentralization of real
                        political power to elected councils at village level achieved during last
                        two-three years is very impressive sign of progress; problems in many areas
                        which appeared to Indians almost insurmountable only three or four years ago
                        are now being tackled vigorously. In the international field this confidence
                        is greatly bolstering India's resolve vis-a-vis Chinese.</p>

                        <item>The relative weight of Soviet influence in Afghanistan has grown in
                            recent years and Afghanistan has been increasingly isolated from the
                            West. These developments have been greatly facilitated by the
                            Pushtunistan dispute with Pakistan, in which the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has emerged as Afghanistan's
                            principal source of diplomatic support. The Bloc has also been the sole
                            supplier of large quantities of arms and a, heavy investor in Afghan
                            economic development. Although there is little reason to believe that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will seek to cash in on its
                            investment at an early date, it is now virtually assured of having the
                            dominant foreign influence on Afghanistan's future. (Paras. 15-17,

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>At the same time, Afghanistan will remain deeply concerned with the
                            preservation of its independence and will continue to exercise its
                            considerable skill in hedging Soviet influence. While probably already
                            convinced that the US role will be a secondary one, Kabul will continue
                            eager for US aid and maintenance of the US presence. In general, we are
                            likely to have with us for a considerable future time an Afghanistan
                            very like that we have known for the past few years. (Paras. 21,

                    <p>At the present moment the Pakistan Government is considering whether to
                        accept Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>'s
                        invitation to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to come
                        to Delhi, possibly in April, to discuss Kashmir. This invitation was
                        conveyed by <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Rajeshwar Dayal</persName>, Indian
                        High Commissioner in Karachi, on March 1 and allows for lower-level
                        preliminary talks if desired by Pakistan. At the same time, Zafrullah Khan
                        has indicated to us in New York that Pakistan intends to raise the question
                        again in the Security Council “sometime this month,” a move which Pakistan
                        states can be carried on in parallel with bilateral discussions with India.
                        The Pakistan Embassy had requested a meeting with the Secretary for the
                        Pakistan Ambassador and Zafrullah this week. In the Secretary's absence, the
                        meeting would be with you. The first mutually convenient time, however, will
                        not be until March 19 or later.</p>
                    <p>With the recent Presidential initiative on Kashmir, repeated expressions of
                        American concern over the problem by the President, the Secretary and
                        others, the completion of the Indian elections, and the publication of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s Constitution, we believe a
                        possibility exists for meaningful improvement in Indo-Pakistan relations
                        through bilateral discussions on the Kashmir problem. We also believe a
                        simultaneous consideration of this problem in the Secretary Council would be
                        counterproductive and should be discouraged by us.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, recommend the following sequence of actions by the U.S.
                        Government. (A more detailed report of recent actions is attached as Tab

                        $150 million in development aid over next five years, developing alternative
                        Iranian transit route, and some passenger and cargo aircraft pronto. He
                        justifies all this by stressing the critically adverse effect: on our

                    <p>Big problem is not whether to invest this much in gamble to keep Afghan free.
                        It is whether to do so until transit issue resolved and Afghans calm down on
                        Pushtunistan. So long as they press this, they tend to force us to back our

                        such a policy would merely thrust Afghans even more rapidly into Soviet

                            noted that during the 8-week period that the border had been open, some
                            26,000 tons of U.S. aid material had been transferred into Afghanistan
                            from Pakistan. The border was scheduled to close again on March 29.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> stated that as much

                            definitively to the demarche but, like <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                                >Naim</persName>, he indicated that no progress in the dispute with
                            Pakistan was possible until Pakistan took the initiative to reverse the

                        Department). At outset he said he could not emphasize too strongly how much

                        reconciliation. Our good offices activities vital and he trusted we would

                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>As base for his response to me he said that all must understand that should
                        Pakistan and Afghanistan fail in mending relations both would be ultimate
                        losers. <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> fully recognized this; Pakistan
                        must also understand. This view unassailable whether considered from
                        historic, economic, ethnic or cultural viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>He then launched into careful and detailed reply which he said was final.
                        Minimum upon which <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> willing re-establish
                        relations with Pakistan and of course raise all restriction with respect to
                        matters of transit was re-establishment of Consular and trade agency offices
                        on basis status quo ante. He said firmly that there was no point in
                        attempting begin on basis of trade commission in Karachi with possibilities
                        of gradual expansion. A return of these offices was symbolic restitution
                        their transit rights. These rights must be immune from political
                        considerations. Further the restitution was only proper in view of fact that
                        Pakistan <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0254"/>had taken initiative in
                        dosing these agencies and Consulates without due recourse to unilaterally
                        recognized diplomatic usage. He said it was interesting to note that when
                        Pakistan committed this discourteous and undiplomatic act it did not even
                        inform the United States before doing it. If Pakistan were willing to
                        restore these offices, Afghanistan willing reciprocate by allowing
                        establishment similar Pakistani offices in Afghanistan. If such gesture
                        forthcoming <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> would be willing act
                        immediately to restore transit, allowing details in connection with
                        re-establishment of relations to follow in train. (In subsequent telephone
                        conversation with Hannah, <persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Etemadi</persName>
                        elaborated sequence of steps implicit in above sentences as follows: (1)
                        Decision by <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to restore offices existing
                        before last August; (2) <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> immediate action
                        to resume transit; (3) arrangement of details regarding restoration trade
                        and Consular offices within reasonable time; (4) after actual restoration
                        these offices resumption diplomatic relations.) He pointed out that trade
                        commission in Karachi was no new idea as this had been suggested before even
                        during <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> visit. It would not
                        accomplish what was required and was therefore unsatisfactory and
                        unpromising.</p>
                    <p>With respect to entire Pushtunistan issue which was discussed at considerable
                        length he insisted this question must be treated as subject by itself, and
                        item for continuing negotiation with the Pakistanis (and by implication with
                        tribal leaders themselves). But difference of opinion on this subject must
                        bear no relationship to permanent transit rights and minimum facilities to
                        maintain that right. He emphasized Afghanistan had no territorial ambitions
                        and made it clear that in holding views they do with respect to welfare of
                        Pushtuns, they did not claim that answer to this problem lay in direct or
                        indirect affiliation with Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>So far as closure of border is concerned it will become effective 6 p.m.
                        Thursday March 29. No regular transit of goods will be allowed beyond that
                        point. Diplomatic goods will be subject special permission on basis
                        notification but he indicated that it would not extend to goods other than
                        those considered as personal effects of diplomats. He further asked that no
                        pipeline of supply be allowed to build up backlog in Pakistan until position
                        clarifies. Other items raised during the conversation will be reported in
                        subsequent messages.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment and recommendation:</hi> There is little doubt in
                        my mind that this is firm decision of <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>
                        and that <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> was speaking on Cabinet
                        instruction.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_ENA1">Nur Ahmed Etemadi</persName> was present to be
                        sure there was no misunderstanding in language and careful notes were kept
                        of everything the Foreign Minister told me. It is my considered opinion that
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> government thinks it knows
                        the risks involved and is quite willing to face consequences in pursuit of
                        policy set forth by <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> today. At
                        same time I believe there would be a great sigh of relief if Pakistan could
                        see its <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0255"/>way clear to move in this
                        rather far reaching, rather dramatic and probably unexpected act of
                        restoring permission for the establishment of these Consulates and trade
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>When I consider far-reaching possible results to free world interests in this
                        area and especially to Pakistan I cannot do otherwise than recommend that we
                        urge Pakistan muster necessary courage, imagination and far sighted
                        self-interest to thus restore her influence in this area. As all concerned
                        will of course know, I make this recommendation with no history of prejudice
                        or lack of understanding of Pakistan's position in our free world affiance
                        and certainly with no disregard for its immediate self-interest. If this
                        moment in history is allowed to pass and Afghanistan thus forced or
                        encouraged to strengthen her orientation elsewhere the non-Communist
                        neighbors in this area will lose far more than they possibly can [gain]
                        through this relatively harmless concession.</p>
                    <p>I have been much impressed by my recent conversations with German Ambassador
                        who is very strongly of opinion that some dramatic move is needed now to
                        stop the drift in the inevitable direction it [Afghanistan] is taking and
                        even the British Ambassador told me yesterday that while he thought
                        Pakistan's tough attitude had achieved something in the beginning, a
                        continuation of it was counter-productive.</p>
                    <p>An imaginative move of this nature is the type of which only the free world
                        and its members are capable. To do it in time would take much of the wind
                        out of the Communist sails and would bring great relief to many elements in
                        Afghanistan who only regard with horror the prospect of being forced more
                        closely into the Soviet embrace. A gesture of this magnitude to begin the
                        healing process would enhance Pakistan's prestige as well as our own,
                        placing us in an advantageous role in helping to guide Afghanistan policy
                        through hazardous shoals during this critical period.<note n="3"

                    <p>Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> opened the conversation by saying that he
                        had wanted to talk with the Secretary to explain Pakistan's motives for
                        bringing the Kashmir issue before the Security Council. He said that he had
                        had a long talk the previous day with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1"
                            >Stevenson</persName> on the subject of Kashmir and had gone into it at
                        more detail than usual since Ambassador Plimpton was his usual point of
                        contact on Kashmir. The Secretary said he had seen a brief report of the
                        talk but welcomed Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName>'s willingness to come to
                        Washington and give a full exposition of Pakistan's position.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that Pakistan was not wedded to
                        Security Council consideration, but it seemed that this offered the only way
                        at present to get attention focused on the Kashmir issue.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s recent statements that the only thing that
                        India could consider was an adjustment from the present situation, and, in
                        fact, <persName>Nehru</persName>'s whole performance in the face of
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s efforts since 1960 to
                        negotiate on Kashmir had convinced Pakistan that India would not enter into
                        meaningful discussions unless maximum pressure were brought to bear. The
                        people of Kashmir itself were being denied the right of self-determination,
                        and the President of Azad Kashmir, Mr. <persName>Khurshid</persName>, was
                        full of plans to take unilateral action. Khurshid had pressed Minister for
                        External Affairs <persName corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> to extend
                        Pakistan's recognition to Azad Kashmir, but <persName corresp="#p_QM1"
                            >Qadir</persName> had turned the request down. <persName
                            corresp="#p_QM1">Qadir</persName> had said that the new Pakistan
                        Government which would be formed in June would have a new Minister for
                        External Affairs since he was stepping down. The new Minister might
                        reconsider Khurshid's request. Khurshid had also raised the possibility of
                        seeking recognition from Communist China. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName>
                        questioned the wisdom of all of <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0257"
                        />these plans, but said they were evidence that the situation could develop
                        into something that was more than local if the issue were not settled. For
                        example, if Pakistan became militarily engaged in Kashmir, Afghanistan might
                        be tempted to make a grab at the Northwest Frontier.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> then recounted and elaborated on a
                        suggestion he had made to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1"
                            >Stevenson</persName> regarding possible practical Security Council
                        action. India continued to claim that it could not comply with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions because Pakistan had not
                        taken the first step by withdrawing its forces from Azad Kashmir. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> wanted to revive a suggestion made by
                        Swedish Ambassador Jarring in 1957 calling for a commission or an individual
                        to be appointed by the Secretary General to draw up a list of defaults by
                        both sides in non-compliance with the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1"
                            >UNCIP</gloss> resolutions and the several Graham reports. For example,
                        the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions did not call for
                        unilateral Pakistan withdrawal from Azad Kashmir first without corresponding
                        Indian action as <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>
                        always claimed. Pakistan would welcome an impartial investigation of the
                        whole issue. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> had told Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> that India would not agree to an
                        individual from the West but might agree to a neutral. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> had made no suggestions to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> but now would like
                        personally to say that he would prefer to have the Secretary General himself
                        undertake the task, but would welcome a man of integrity from any nation. He
                        suggested that someone from the new unaligned nations of Africa might be
                        appropriate. He specifically named Mr. <persName>Amachree</persName> of
                        Nigeria who has virtue in Indian eyes of being a non-Muslim from a country
                        which probably is more friendly to India than Pakistan. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> had asked what the United
                        Kingdom's reaction would be. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that he
                        was going to see both Sir <persName>Patrick</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName> and the Secretary General in the
                        next several days to discuss the proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether Pakistan was raising the issue at this time
                        purely on its own merits or whether internal pressures in Pakistan made it
                        necessary. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that he did not sense any
                        more specific pressure than usual but knew that there was a strong official
                        and popular feeling in Pakistan that somehow progress had to be made towards
                        a settlement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked how Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> saw the U.S.
                        role. He added that since the United States was trying to play an active
                        part in both capitals in an effort to bring about a solution, Security
                        Council action put us in an uncomfortable position. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> recounted Pakistan's efforts since last
                        summer to get action on Kashmir, and said that the Indian seizure of Goa had
                        made it even more urgent a necessity. Pakistan wondered whether the United
                        States was being active enough. For example, had anything been done since
                        India turned down the U.S. proposal regarding <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                            >Eugene Black</persName>? The Secretary said we were continuing to <pb
                            n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0258"/>examine the matter to see what we
                        could do. He wondered whether negotiations could be carried on bilaterally.
                        Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that Pakistan considered that a third
                        party was necessary. In response to a question from Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>, Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that India did not want a third party
                        in any possible negotiations. The Secretary asked whether a third party from
                        a member of the Commonwealth would be acceptable to India and Pakistan. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said this proposal would be agreeable to
                        Pakistan but probably not to India. He added that Pakistan would even accept
                        Nkrumah.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> then said that if Pakistan's proposal did
                        not work, Pakistan was faced with two alternatives: (1) to reconcile its
                        people to <persName>Nehru</persName>'s position; or (2) to go along with
                        whatever course Khurshid would take as President of Azad Kashmir. Pakistan
                        did not want the second alternative, and the first alternative in effect
                        provided for a partition without giving the Kashmiris any voice in their own
                        destiny and constituted basically a military settlement of a political
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> asked whether Pakistan's
                        proposed action might not appear vindictive. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> disclaimed any desire of this nature, and
                        said that Pakistan simply wanted to establish a reasonable procedure to
                        determine the defaults on both sides and get on towards the implementation
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether it was unfair to say that preliminary negotiation
                        between Pakistan and India was necessary to insure a successful outcome in
                        the Security Council and went on to ask what Pakistan's reaction would be if
                        there were no favorable result from the debate. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> did not respond to the Secretary's first
                        query, and said that a real failure would increase Pakistan's frustration to
                        a great extent.</p>
                    <p>Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> then said that it appeared as if April 27
                        was the first available date. He added that he assumed <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> would lead India's
                        delegation. The Secretary said that we should all try to reach agreement
                        before April 27 which would make the debate unnecessary. He asked Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> whether his government would postpone the
                        debate if the Indians agreed to negotiations. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said he could not commit Pakistan, but
                        thought a postponement could be arranged if the Indians appeared ready to
                        enter constructive negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked how long it had been since there had been a thorough
                        review of Indo-Pakistan relations by top level people. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said there had been none since the
                        September 1960 meeting of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> then said that
                        the internal pressures in Pakistan were greater than Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> had indicated. He sketched the history of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> meetings in July 1961 from which Pakistan <pb
                            n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0259"/>had gained hope of real progress on
                            Kashmir.<note n="1" xml:id="d114fn1">See <ref target="#d30">Document
                                30</ref>.</note> If there were further delays, the people of
                        Pakistan would begin to wonder whether U.S. assurances meant anything.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary reiterated the difficulties of the U.S. position. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> said he appreciated these
                        difficulties but his government could not explain this position
                        satisfactorily to the people of Pakistan in view of the popular
                        understanding of the U.S. commitment. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said
                        that US. approval of Pakistan's proposal would not mean that the United
                        States was clearly taking the side of Pakistan against India. The Secretary
                        said that we would have to think urgently about whether that would or would
                        not be the case.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName> said that the Security
                        Council should look forward to solutions rather than attempt to assess
                        blame. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that Pakistan did not want to
                        assess blame but to find out what needed to be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> wondered whether any useful
                        purpose would be served by basing inquiry on outdated resolutions. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that any other course would simply
                        prove to the Indians that their foot-dragging policy was succeeding. He
                        recalled various attempts in the past, notably by Sir Owen Dixon and
                            <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> Bogra, to get
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to take a new look. Each time
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had gone back on his word.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> asked whether there was any
                        special reason for bringing the matter up now. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> had really not had time during the first two years of
                        his regime, and last year had hoped that his efforts with President
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> would achieve progress.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> asked whether
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> had canvassed the Security Council. Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that his canvassing really was
                        circular because the other countries always asked what the US. position was
                        going to be. His personal guess was that the United Kingdom, France, China
                        and Ireland would vote for Pakistan. He was not sure about Ghana and the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. He said that really he believed if
                        a reasonable proposal got the necessary majority and was then vetoed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Pakistan could go to the UNGA
                        with a resolution that might pass.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether there was anything to be done quietly before
                        April 27. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that the Indian offer as
                        relayed by <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Dayal</persName> to <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was not sincere since it did not call
                        for adequate preparation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>
                        said our understanding of the offer seemed different.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked whether there would be any merit in Pakistan's holding
                        secret, discursive, agenda-less talks with India much as we were with the
                        Soviets on Berlin. Sir <persName>Zafrulla</persName> said that this would
                        only allow India to procrastinate further. The Secretary then said that he
                        would have to get into the matter promptly and Sir
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> thanked him and said that he hoped the
                        United States would give support to Pakistan's proposal.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>, Three months ago, I had the
                        honour of writing to you in connection with a procedural move by Pakistan in
                        the Security Council on the Kashmir question. The Council decided to
                        consider the substantive aspects of the dispute after March 1, 1962. It has
                        since been agreed by its Members to hold a meeting on April 27.</p>
                    <p>It is our hope that the Council will address itself squarely to the task of
                        resolving the deadlock which has been obtaining for the last several years
                        over the implementation of the relevant <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolutions.</p>
                    <p>In view of the disagreement between the parties as to which side is
                        responsible for the deadlock, an obvious step for the Council to take would
                        be to proceed to determine the state of implementation of the resolution of
                        the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan of 13 August 1948, and
                        to find out what needs to be done by either side so as to make progress
                        towards the achievement of the United Nations objectives in Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>The Council may well heed the assistance of a suitable person to be enabled
                        to discharge this responsibility. We are inclined to think that at this
                        stage of consideration of the Kashmir question, the designation of a person
                        of integrity and international standing from one of the non-aligned African
                        countries is likely to commend itself most widely to members of the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>If this proposition fails to obtain the necessary majority, the Security
                        Council could turn to a recommendation of Dr. <persName>Frank P.
                            Graham</persName>, in his report of 28 March 1958, that the two heads of
                        government should meet, in the presence of a United Nations representative,
                        to resolve the outstanding differences between India and Pakistan on the
                        implementation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions on the
                        Kashmir issue. The presence of the United Nations could be most effectively
                        ensured in such bilateral negotiations, for the reason stated, by the
                        designation of a suitable person from one of the non-aligned African Members
                        of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>In expressing these thoughts for your consideration, I am not oblivious of
                        Prime Ministers <persName>Nehru</persName>'s reiterated opposition to the
                        presence of a third party in any talks that may be held between him and
                        myself. I am only too painfully aware of this adamant stand of his on the
                        issue which to me, seems utterly unreasonable. At the same time, I must
                        point out <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0261"/>that if the good offices
                        of a third person are not made available to the two of us, no useful purpose
                        is likely to be served by our meeting. Pakistan will be bound to insist that
                        the two <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions should
                        constitute the basis of any settlement of the Kashmir dispute. On the other
                        hand Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> has been insisting on the status quo as
                        the only course open for a solution. It is in such circumstances that the
                        good offices of the United Nations through a designated representative,
                        become most essential if not indispensable, to the prospects of a fruitful
                        confrontation. It may be possible for this third person to suggest
                        approaches after taking into account the relevant <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> resolutions and the vital interests at stake—without placing
                        any responsibility for his initiatives on either Pandit
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> or myself—in order to prevent a breakdown in
                        our discussions.</p>
                    <p>I have ventured to share these thoughts with you in the hope that you will
                        appreciate the reasons why Pakistan feels it incumbent upon itself to ask
                        for Security Council discussion and act:ion on the Kashmir question. I am
                        confident that in our efforts to redeem the promise and pledge of
                        self-determination and justice to the people of Kashmir we may rely on your
                        sympathy and full support.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan's appeal to the Security Council is in no way incompatible with
                        bilateral talks between Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName> and myself. It follows from what I have said above
                        that the Security Council alone will be able to provide an element to such
                        discussions which is essential to prevent their precipitous breakdown and to
                        keep them going until an equitable and realistic solution of the Kashmir
                        dispute is achieved.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> invited me to
                        visit India to continue our previous discussions on the India-Pakistan
                        questions, including the Kashmir dispute. 'While expressing my readiness to
                        accept his invitation, I suggested to him that it would be advisable first
                        to prepare the ground for a fruitful outcome to a meeting at our level lest
                        a failure result in the exacerbation of relations between our two countries
                        and an aggravation of the existing tension in the sub-continent. To my mind,
                        prudence demands that preliminary talks should take place at the official or
                        ministerial level to explore the outlines and prospects of the negotiations
                        which might be held at the level of the heads of government if they are to
                        lead to a final resolution of this grave and tragic problem.</p>
                    <p>While agreeing to preliminary talks at official level, India insisted that
                        the move in the Security Council must first be abandoned. What I fear to
                        contemplate is the contingency of interminable meetings at a lower level
                        being protracted for weeks and months to circumvent Pakistan's appeal to the
                        Security Council. A suggestion made by us that we might have such a meeting
                        before the matter comes up in the Security Council in pursuance of the move
                        made by us, was turned down. I see <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0262"
                        />from certain reports that this suggestion is being misrepresented as a
                        demand for the Kashmir settlement within a week or ten days.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan, throughout the entire period of fourteen years for which the
                        dispute has lasted, has given proof, time and again, of its moderation,
                        patience and faith in the solution of international disputes by peaceful
                        means in the face of provocation, intransigence and threats of violence from
                        our great neighbor.</p>
                    <p>I realise only too well that without the goodwill and support of the United
                        States in the Security Council, the cause of self-determination for the
                        people of Kashmir will inevitably be lost I am confident Mr. President, that
                        your great country which had done so much for the freedom of men and nations
                        will not let this happen.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> stated that it was his
                        understanding the points had been discussed fully by the President and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> and that we had

                        there were new developments or changes in policy. At this time we had
                        nothing to add. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>
                        agreed to spell out the U.S. position so that there would be no
                        misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the assurances given President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> meet Pakistan's needs; a public statement or a
                        reiteration to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>
                        privately are not necessary and would serve no useful purpose (points 2 and
                        3).</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>, in referring to points 1
                        and 4, said the U.S. anticipates no further action. He stated that the U.S.
                        is very conscious of the problem of differentiating between military and
                        economic assistance; obviously large scale economic aid permits a country to
                        divert its own resources to the purchase of arms. The U.S. believes that it
                        is in Pakistan's long-term interest, as well as of the rest of the free
                        world, to have India's economy develop. The U.S. has no reason to believe
                        that, if U.S. economic aid to India were decreased, ipso facto military
                        purchases would decrease. Each nation establishes its own policies and
                        priorities; India would probably decide to maintain its forces and, if
                        necessary suffer the consequences in economic development. The U.S. also
                        believes that economic assistance should not be tied to a particular
                        decision within that country unrelated to the purposes of the assistance.
                        Rather, the best way of meeting the arms race problem is by discussion
                        between the two of their mutual problems. For example, the U.S. is now
                        trying at Geneva to grapple with the arms race; perhaps, the same efforts
                        can be made at the regional level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> continued by commenting that
                        in his personal view there are three ways the progress being made in South
                        Asia could be upset: <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Masood</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> did not wish to see Indian economic development suffer, but
                        were there not other pressures the U.S. could bring to bear? He noted
                        Pakistan's concern over the Kashmir question and the “30% increase of the
                        Indian military budget” He asked whether, following the ill-fated <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE1">Black</persName> proposal, the President and Department
                        had given consideration to what further steps the U.S. could take in
                        assisting a solution to the Kashmir problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> replied that much thought had been given, but that
                        for the time being the Security Council had the issue before it and that
                        further U.S. proposals would depend on the Security Council's actions.</p>

                            argued that it was important to recognize the danger of further Soviet
                            encroachments in Afghanistan and necessary to move vigorously to bolster
                            Afghanistan's traditional neutral status. To that end, he advocated
                            continued support for Afghan development projects and the establishment
                            of an alternative transit route through Iran for U.S. aid materials. He
                            anticipated that the impasse in relations between Pakistan and

                    <p>Essentially, they have decided to be reasonably forthcoming with Afghans on

                        this we will seek to convince Kabul we want to help keep Afghanistan

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> wanted a major

                            <item>Most important, State/<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> propose
                                indirect pressure on Afghans by telling them that shipment of large
                                tonnages via Iran is “impractical and uneconomic. Therefore, on any
                                major projects we tell Afghans we propose to ship the necessary
                                commodities to Karachi on assumption they will reopen frontier. Most
                                big US aid projects, e.g., Kabul-Kandahar road, are in this
                                category. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, of course,
                                strongly opposes any such tie between US aid and transit
                                issue.</item>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> has come in with a long
                        dissent to this last; he says Afghans will size it up immediately as US
                        pressure and greatly resent it (Kabul 624 attached).<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d117fn3">Dated May 6. (Ibid., 811.0089/5-662)</note> Therefore,
                        he feels that forthcoming nature of rest of our approach will be largely
                        nullified by news that US will ship in supplies for major projects only
                        through Karachi. He urges that we simply omit this angle. Indeed, he argues
                        that if we are going to use such pressures on the Afghans, we should “light
                        as many fires as possible in all Afghan quarters to bring internal pressure
                        to bear on <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>.”</p>
                    <p>As between the <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>/<persName
                            corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> approach and that of <persName
                            corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName>, I favor the latter. For us to tell the Afghans that
                        we will do everything possible to help them, including an all-out effort to
                        open up an uneconomic Iranian route, is tantamount to telling them that we
                        will support them irrespective of their quarrel with the Pakistanis, thus
                        removing all incentive to compromise. In effect, we'd prolong the dispute
                        rather than damping it down. Moreover, so far as effective help to
                        Afghanistan is concerned we can only provide it over the Iranian route at
                        great excess cost and delay, at any rate for several years until a good road
                        can be built.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, if we are to compete effectively with Soviets in Afghanistan,
                        re-opening of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> route seems essential.
                        We cannot really get the Afghans to do so until we get them to recognize
                        that staying out of the Soviet embrace is more important than pursuing
                        Pushtoonistan dispute. <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0266"/>Moreover,
                        with so many problems looming between us and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>, should we add to them an insulting indication that we
                        will help the Afghans regardless of what they do on Pushtu issue? In sum,
                        while all concerned agree with <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        that US should make a major effort to help Afghans stay out of Soviet
                        clutches, the rest of us disagree with him on tactics.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I gather that <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> himself
                        is pleased with his half a loaf; he did get a pretty forthcoming set of
                        projects which will clue Afghans that we're still interested, and enough
                        movement on Iran route so Afghans see a partial alternative to total
                        dependence on <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> door to West. True, we
                        thus fall between two stools but the modest bait we're dangling before
                        Afghans may whet their appetite for more.</p>
                    <p>Ergo, no need for a “needle” on <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                        >Bowles</persName>' behalf. About the only useful handle would be an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> requesting State to due the President on
                        US policy, and then a confrontation before JFK (I suspect he'd come down on
                            <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GWS1"
                            >Gaud</persName> side too). So I see no WH action indicated at this
                        time, but will keep in close touch.</p>

                            <persName>Desai</persName> called me in to say that he had not been
                        fully informed on developments when he talked to me on Friday last. In fact
                        he had learned upon return of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                        that exploratory discussions with Soviets had been taking place and <pb

                        available promptly on payment terms which Indians could afford and with
                        prospect of manufacturer and appropriate provision for spares in India. The
                        papers continue to speak a completed deal and I sensed he might be softening
                        me up for such an announcement. I asked him directly if the transaction
                        completed and he said no. I then asked him if a decision had been taken to
                        buy the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s and he said not in the sense
                        of a government action, whatever that may mean. I then made the following

                            <item>I did not like being told on Friday that nothing was happening and

                                    <persName>Desai</persName>'s presumed information I had reported
                                that no negotiations were in progress.</item>

                            <item>Our policy was to be tolerant and good humored but he, <persName

                                Minister should be aware of the limits. We were providing $500
                                million in economic aid, another $280 million in food. The Indians
                                were saying in effect that this was insufficient so they must turn
                                to Soviets to equip their forces. This was callous of American
                                public opinion and highly illogical to boot.</item>

                            <item>To reinforce the point, I told him of conversation last night on
                                the plane with L.K. Jha, Permanent Secretary Finance. Jha sought me
                                out to speak of their developing alarm over balance of payments. As
                                matters now stood, this kind of worry came to us while <persName

                                Such a division of labor would never be acceptable to Congressional
                                or American public opinion for reasons he could well
                                understand.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>It was true, as <persName>Desai</persName> had said earlier, that
                                the Soviets had made an offer and we had not. It was not our policy
                                to merchandise our arms around the world and this was a policy that
                                India should appreciate. I then told him that we had specifically
                                asked Lockheed to exercise restraint. I noted that in the case of
                                the C-130, a dual-purpose vehicle, we had offered a demonstration
                                and had been refused.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>I then took notice of his earlier statement that the Russians had
                                offered better terms including rupee payment and that India could
                                not accept arms aid. Rupee payment was as much a form of aid, and as
                                prejudicial to Indian principles, as acceptance of <gloss
                                    target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance. Because Russian
                                bookkeeping was more clandestine than ours acceptance of rupees was
                                no less in the nature of a gift. It was the same deal, slightly less
                                generous, as the one on which they got food.</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>Finally, while noting that I could not promise to match Soviet
                                offer, we did expect to be asked. If it developed that for reasons
                                of policy or security classification we couldn't do business, then
                                at least they would have dealt with us courteously and could go
                                ahead with the Soviets. I took occasion also to observe that there
                                could be no emergency <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0268"/>over
                                the licensing of manufacture since planes from this source would not

                    <p><persName>Desai</persName>, who seemed rather ill at ease during this
                        eloquence, was I think impressed. I asked that matter be put firmly and
                        fully before Prime Minister and he said it would be. I then said I hope we

                    <p>To pin these matters down I am summarizing them in form of a note to

                            <item>The drift apart of the U.S. and Pakistan; there is an absence of
                                communication with Pakistan; Pakistan has not consulted with the
                                U.S. on important actions—closure of Afghan offices, boundary talks
                                with Chicoms.</item>

                                foreign policies; Pakistan leaders have made it clear that they are
                                dissatisfied with the extent of U.S. support on those issues—Kashmir
                                and relations with Afghanistan—directly affecting Pakistan
                                security</item>

                            <item>At the same time, U.S.-Indian relations, possibly in the military
                                field, may be entering a new phase as the Chinese Communist threat
                                to India becomes more acute; and the U.S. will need added
                                flexibility. The problem, therefore, is how to gain this
                                freedom.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>A. In these circumstances it becomes necessary to examine the following
                        possible lines of action: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>These four lines of action were discussed at length; conclusions are briefly
                        given: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p>The value of our special relationship with Pakistan,
                                    particularly in the military field, is such that we cannot
                                    contemplate withdrawal. Also, the U.S. cannot yet accept the
                                    dissolution of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and

                                <p>On the other hand, India is of such importance that little or no
                                    consideration can be given to a major retrogressive change in

                                national interests. An improvement in Pak-Indian relations is an

                                        present, India's policy has advantages to the U.S., such as

                                flexibility in our immediate problems of communications through

                                resolution. The “Pushtunistan” and Kashmir disputes are deeply
                                rooted and would not disappear if we changed our Pakistan policy.
                                They would continue to threaten area stability.</item>

                                increased flexibility would not be of appreciable significance in
                                the near future.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>B. Having agreed that the advantages do not equal the disadvantages to the
                        U.S. of a major shift, the main issue before us is how to maintain our
                        relations with Pakistan and yet gain the freedom to be more forthcoming in
                        relations with India, e.g., possible provision of military equipment. In the
                        long run a basic improvement in Indo-Pakistan relations is a sina qua non
                        for full freedom in dealing with India. In the short run, however, greater
                        flexibility might be gained if U.S.-Pakistan relations could be
                        strengthened; steps in this direction might include: <list>

                    <p>3598. Yesterday in course of another conversation <gloss target="#t_FonSec1"
                            >FonSec</gloss>
                        <persName>Desai</persName> told me that following my reps <gloss
                            target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had told <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Krishna Menon</persName> that <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal
                        must come before the cabinet and case would be reviewed with full
                        consideration our points.</p>
                    <p>I have been worried in this matter lest <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName> think I have been fighting him indirectly and by proxy
                        so today I made appointment and had long talk. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1"
                            >M.J. Desai</persName> was present At times discussion was rough. He
                        once accused me of addressing him as subordinate official of his Min; I said
                        I was refraining from apology only because I had not done so. In the end we
                        parted fairly amicably and I had feeling that I made all the necessary
                        points and, as usual very little impression. Following were the principal
                        interchanges: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>As earlier to <persName>Desai</persName> I said we could no
                                explain provision of $850 million in civilian aid while leaving to
                                the Russians the task of giving <gloss target="#t_mil1">mil</gloss>
                                assistance. He bristled and said not one stick of equipment was
                                supplied under <gloss target="#t_mil1">mil</gloss> aid programs. All
                                was paid for. I had hoped for this and pointed out that according to
                                newspaper accounts the <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> equipment
                                was being supplied for rupees. Food Min <persName>S.K.
                                    Patil</persName> could as well argue that <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >PL</gloss> 480 food was purchased commercially. However we and
                                he considered it aid. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                                then said rupees went into convertible accounts and could be spent
                                by Sovs. I pointed out this only proved that the Sovs were less
                                generous than we. We put our rupees into inconvertible accounts and
                                returned them to the Indians. I then added that if the Sovs gave as
                                much econ aid as we did the Indians would be quite well supplied
                                with dollars from trade and could go in for <gloss target="#t_mil1"
                                    >mil</gloss> procurement in the US. Thus, even if the
                                transactions with the Sovs were commercial which they are not, they
                                are made possible by American aid. At this juncture <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said these were
                                considerations for the FinMin, not for him. His concern was only
                                with getting the best possible equipment. One happy dividend of this
                                interchange on the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s is that I
                                have at last managed to get Sov sales for rupees on all fours with
                                any other kind of <gloss target="#t_mil1">mil</gloss> aid.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> then said that as
                                    <gloss target="#t_DefMin1">DefMin</gloss> his task was to be
                                sure Indian pilots flew planes equal those of Chinese. He also made
                                refs but very passing ones to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                    >Pak</gloss> F104's. The morale effects of inferior equipment
                                was damaging. India he said was not looking for war or conflict but
                                her borders were everywhere subject to almost daily violation or air
                                penetration. <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0273"/>She had to
                                show that this could not occur. In a passage strongly reminiscent of
                                some unidentified warmonger he said only strength would ensure
                                peace. He was putting all the data on available arms on the table
                                and they would then reach a decision. I said that we had sympathy
                                for many of India's problems but could not understand how all the
                                data could be on the table since they had not asked about American
                                terms or looked very seriously at American equipment. He said they
                                had gone into detail with Lockheed. I pointed out that they had
                                refused a demonstration of the C-130 for which he had once asked and
                                noted that Lockheed as a private firm could not talk about any terms
                                or arrangements. These were matters for the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> on which we had never been approached. He said
                                C-130 not available; Lockheed had had to borrow a test model from
                                the US Army. I pointed out that Lockheed did not keep a private
                                inventory in Europe and pressed him on when he had last asked about
                                delivery dates. He said, a bit reluctantly, that it was three years
                                ago.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He then said our security arrangements were too difficult and sent
                                out for and read me the note about the security team when we offered
                                the Mark 44 torpedo. I asked if the <gloss target="#t_Sov1"
                                    >Sov</gloss>s were giving them secret equipment without any
                                security precaution. He said this was an improper question. I then
                                ventured that he was comparing a country that asked for assurances
                                on its classified equipment and a country which did not give out any
                                secret stuff at all. He disagreed.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I then made my principal pitch. As a senior member of the cabinet with a
                        special knowledge of the US he was surely aware of the effect of this
                        purchase on American public opinion and on pending legislation. This was a
                        serious problem for US in which the Indian govt had the greatest possible
                        collateral interest. The prime question was not the by-passing of American
                        for <gloss target="#t_Sov1">Sov</gloss> equipment. I was not merchandising
                        American equipment. It was the effect of any action at this juncture on the
                        US public and <gloss target="#t_pol1">pol</gloss> opinion. He said he was
                        conscious of this. I thought it well not to express obvious doubts.</p>
                    <p>The debate (or bickering) covered <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Adlai
                            Stevenson</persName>, the American press treatment of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName>, our alleged refusal of Sidewinders and the improbable
                        contention, which I also did not challenge, that the <gloss target="#t_IAF1"
                            >IAF</gloss> had the ground radar for aerial control of F104s and <gloss

                    <p>3691. Pass Defense. Embassy believes Indian political situation is entering
                        period of transition with major implications for U.S. interests and
                        requiring clear decisions. We are aware that in light of recent Senate
                        action and in face current attitudes toward India the timing of decision
                        could not be more inconvenient than this, and ways of juggling time factor
                        have had our detailed consideration. Unfortunately the tune is being called
                        by others.</p>
                    <p>The first factor in situation is Prime Minister's age and illness and
                        following possibilities: (a) In immediate future he may not be exercising
                        dominant influence and this gives increased freedom for maneuver to
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> is dearly determined to exploit
                        situation to weaken American influence and very probably has design to
                        protect his own longer-run position by getting greater dependence on
                        Soviets, (b) Prime Minister may become incapacitated or disappear from
                        immediate scene, which will bring prompt reduction in <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s influence. During this period the
                        US. must play hand in accordance with underlying realities of situation and
                        not surface influences and specifically must avoid action and forestall
                        steps which would play into <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s
                        hands and weaken the fundamentally far stronger pro-western members of
                        cabinet and armed forces. Checking any increased dependence on Soviets, with
                        its political consequences, and protecting present western orientation of
                        military forces are thus vital factors. Against this background question of
                        supply of military equipment to Government of India becomes matter of major
                        significance.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Second basic fact is intense dissatisfaction of Indian Armed Forces
                            with present obsolete military equipment. Accordingly Indian defense
                            establishment will continue to exert strong pressure on Government of
                            India to obtain modern military equipment through foreign purchase or
                            some sort of direct military assistance. In absence of detente on
                            Chinese Communist border, and in lesser degree on Pakistan border,
                            Government of India will get more modern military equipment one way or
                            another. It must be stressed that in Government of India decision on
                            material prestige and morale factors may well take precedence over
                            question of strict operational role. This is especially case in their
                            decision to immediately obtain high performance supersonic aircraft.
                            This does not lessen force of determination or problem created thereby
                            or open way to dissuasion.</item>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Third basic fact is that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is unable
                            to pay for substantial quantities of modern military equipment with
                            foreign exchange. Accordingly, Government of India will have to turn to
                            either Soviet or western aid, disguised or undisguised. Some senior
                            members Government of India now recognize purchase Soviet equipment for
                            rupees must be considered form of military aid, and Washington will be
                            aware this has been a major thrust of our recent arguments.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Fourth fact is that our intervention and that of United Kingdom have
                            for the moment blocked <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21 deal.
                            Inherent in decision to delay is recognition that insufficient
                            consideration given to United States and United Kingdom alternatives.
                            Therefore, Indian decision to delay requires United States to make
                            decision on its course. We must decide whether Soviets will make
                            important inroads into Indian military with likely far-reaching
                            consequences or whether west will provide alternative and competitive
                            sources of supply. Mission is united in recommending latter course. We
                            recognize public announcement of decision, especially re supply F-104's,
                            must be related to this year's foreign aid legislation, a point on which
                            Indians, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> apart,
                            can be persuaded.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We stress now the consequences. In absence of a favorable United
                            States policy India will go to Soviets for military equipment. If
                            Government of India obtains <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21
                            and/or other types of major military equipment from Soviets, following
                            will result: (a) Large number of Soviet technicians will be introduced
                            into Indian defense establishment. (b)There will be much closer
                            association with Soviet Armed Forces than presently exists. The AN-12's,
                            MI-4's, IL-14's and HF-24 engines have already introduced some 200
                            Soviet technicians into Indian defense installations. (c) Position of
                            senior Indian officers who presently pro-west in orientation and who do
                            not want Soviet military equipment will be undermined. (d) Five to ten
                            years from now present strongly pro-west senior officers will be out of
                            picture. Soviet training and technical advisors who would accompany
                            purchase of Soviet equipment will have inevitable influence on younger
                            post-independence Indian military officers now rising to position of
                            prominence. (e) Soviets will emerge as the defender of India against
                            dramatic border enemies. This will be a source of gratitude and esteem
                            outweighing power plants, steel mills or other economic aid. Movement of
                            India toward west during past five years will be arrested and possibly
                            reversed. (f) Action will serve directly interests of small group in
                            Government of India, led by <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna

                            on these. Way should similarly be opened on other needs. We do not
                            minimize the difficulties of finding a right time and, as noted, if
                            decision is fairly clear we can ask responsible Indians for tolerance on

                            even by months. The chance to shove through <gloss target="#t_MIG1"

                    <p>“I am very glad to have your latest views on the Kashmir question in your
                        thoughtful letter of April twentieth.<note n="1" xml:id="d123fn1"><ref
                                target="#d115">Document 115</ref>.</note> It is obviously of great
                        importance that on this extremely difficult issue we should keep in close
                        contact.</p>
                    <p>“As I said when we met last summer, we too attach the highest priority to an
                        equitable solution of the Kashmir dispute. It is clearly essential for the
                        peace and security of South Asia that such a solution be found. It was for
                        this reason that I proposed in January that the matter be considered again
                        with the good offices of a third party of the standing of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE1">Black</persName>. I must say that I found it hard to
                        understand why Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>
                        chose to reject this opportunity, and I continue to believe that the time
                        will come when a third party will indeed be necessary. Because of the
                        current position of India, I do not see how we can move to this form of
                        negotiation at present, but we should all keep looking for an appropriate
                        opening in this direction.</p>
                    <p>“I understand why, in the circumstances, you feel it necessary to turn to the
                        Security Council. Yet I ought to tell you in all honesty that after my
                        experiences of the last twelve months, I do not personally have great hopes
                        from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action on this subject nor on a good
                        many others. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has great values, and we
                        are among its strongest supporters, but I am sure you will agree that we
                        cannot count on discussions and voting in New York to give us much direct
                        help in finding a fair settlement in Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>“Nevertheless, I understand your own position in the matter, and I have in
                        mind our discussion of the subject last summer. It is good that our
                        representatives are working closely with each other, and we have found your
                        Government's ideas on a possible resolution to be most constructive. On this
                        basis, we are in a good position to cooperate with you during the debate by
                        supporting a suitable text based on these ideas.</p>
                    <p>“Let me repeat that we deeply share your desire for an early just and
                        peaceful Kashmir settlement. We will keep up our efforts to this end.
                        Obviously, an issue as complex and stubborn as this one will require of both
                        sides the greatest imagination and flexibility if a common basis for <pb
                            n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0278"/>agreement is to be found. I cannot
                        quite share the suggestion in the last paragraph of your letter that the
                        role of the United States can be decisive in this matter, but I can and do
                        assure you of our deep interest in a fair settlement.</p>
                    <p>“In closing, let me speak again of the broad and general feeling of good will
                        and sympathy which exists for Pakistan here in the United States. These are
                        days of tension in your country and also in ours, and I find it helpful that
                        there is between our people and those of Pakistan so dear a sense of
                        friendship.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> joins me in warm
                        expression of our high and cordial esteem. Sincerely, <persName

                    <p>While deploring what he termed growing testiness, duplicity, intolerance and
                        unyielding hostility of Indian policy toward Pak, he emphasized inescapable
                        necessity for maintaining effective diplomatic communication with India—not
                        just pro forma diplomatic contact but meaningful diplomatic intercourse
                        which with time and patience might grow into constructive exchange. He
                        revealed great and growing disenchantment with Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, whom he characterized as arrogant,
                        irritable, truculent, obstinate. He characterized <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        as a fraud <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0279"/>masquerading as an

                        feels that he lives a pretense and sham.</p>
                    <p>When I put in a good word for Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>, observing that
                        Indo-Pak relations were certainly better off with <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        at helm in India than would be case with some other figures he could name,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was rather inclined to take
                        issue with me. After discounting <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName>'s chances of ever succeeding to PriMinship, he said
                        that in his view almost any other Indian politician would have less
                        potential than <persName>Nehru</persName> for doing harm to Indo—Pak
                        relations. He felt that with inevitable not-too-distant step-down of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> from PriMinship, a better and more tolerant
                        Indian understanding of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> legitimate
                        aspirations and desires for satisfactory relations with India could
                        reasonably be hoped for.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> dwelt at some length on
                        regretability of heavy Indian armament expenditures from resources which
                        were needed for econ development. He thought it unfortunate that American
                        econ development assistance helped India to build up military capability.
                        This increased Indian military pressure on Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>I reminded him that there was no actual or prospective US military assistance
                        program for India and that our econ development assistance was earmarked for
                        specific and well justified econ projects not related to arms
                        procurement.</p>
                    <p>President admitted this but argued that indirectly our aid facilitated Indian
                        purchase of arms by swelling pool of econ resources out of which arms
                        purchases had to be financed. He did not know precisely how a change might
                        be effected, but he wished some aid formula could be devised which would
                        make it impossible for India to purchase advanced types of offensive weapons
                        without thereby losing part of the foreign econ assistance on which she
                        depends.</p>
                    <p>When I pointed out that such punitive provisions would be offensive to
                        national pride anywhere, he replied that Indian dependence on US aid and
                        friendship was so great that India would respond, albeit reluctantly, to
                        influence of this sort. When I pressed him, he admitted that we could not
                        and should not radically alter the pattern of our econ assistance to India.
                        He recognized that stability in India was necessary for the well being of
                        entire subcontinent and did not quarrel with my statement that good US
                        relations with India, including US ability to wield some influence there,
                        was essential to free world interests, both regional and global. I told him
                        that we intended to exemplify in all phases of our relationship with
                        Pakistan the posture of a loyal ally and a good friend, but that we did not
                        intend that this relationship should impair our friendship with India.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> did not quarrel with
                        this but said his most earnest piece of advice to us on our Indian policy
                        was, “Don't let India take you <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0280"/>for
                        granted.” He said Indians were all too prone to do this, taking advantage of
                        US generosity good nature and the known high value we place on keeping India
                        non-aligned with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He said our
                        bargaining position with India is stronger than we realize and that more
                        realistic negotiating with India on our part is needed. He predicted that a
                        firmer line would be successful if we played our cards since India in
                        actuality is dependent on US politically and strategically, as well as
                        economically. He argued that India would “have no place to go” if she turned
                        her back on United States. He emphasized relative degree of isolation of
                        India, assessing that not even non-aligned governments of Southeast Asia
                        such as Indonesia and Burma have any real respect or liking for present
                        Indian government. He quoted Soekarno as having used terms of profane
                        contempt in his appraisal of <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> feels that case for
                        attempting to deny advanced offensive weapons from foreign sources to India
                        has become much stronger in recent months. He believes recent Indian record
                        shows clearly that India has openly abandoned (if indeed she ever adhered
                        to) principles of peaceful settlement of international disputes. Since India
                        invokes force and threat of force for settlement of disputes, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> feels strongly that any
                        country which directly or indirectly contributes importantly to better
                        armament of India becomes an accessory to Indian power tactics and therefore
                        unhelpful to the security of Pakistan. He predicted that any augmented
                        Indian military capability would be used not against China but to intimidate
                        weaker neighbors.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador presented an aid-memoire<note n="1" xml:id="d126fn1">Not
                            printed.</note> outlining his government's concern at the reported
                        possibility that the United States was <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256"
                            facs="0282"/>thinking of supplying F-104s to India, and its general
                        concern over Indian intentions towards Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>He said that Pakistan was particularly worried by <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s statement in the recent
                        Security Council debate on Kashmir that implied India was no longer bound by
                        the cease-fire line imposed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. He said <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s statement, coupled with the
                        reports that India was seeking to improve its already strong military
                        forces, make it appear that India was considering aggressive moves against
                        Pakistan or was at least preparing to maintain and even increase its
                        intransigence on Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>In the view of Pakistan, the threat to India from Communist China was really
                        a part of the whole threat to the subcontinent from the Communist Bloc. The
                        continuance or increase of tension within the subcontinent thus made the
                        Communist task easier. The Ambassador said there were two ways to deal with
                        the problem: (1) to back India completely; (2) or strengthen the region as a
                        whole. Pakistan naturally favored the latter course, but the Ambassador said
                        he could detect real concern over U.S. intentions on <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s part when he made public statements
                        questioning the worth of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and the alliance with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied first on the subject of F-104s. He reminded the
                        Ambassador of the President's commitment to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> in 1961 that the United States would consult with
                        Pakistan before any change was contemplated in our policy on military
                        assistance to India. He said he regretted that Pakistan felt compelled, on
                        the basis of newspaper reports, to make a query of this nature. In direct
                        reply he said that India had not asked the United States for F-104s nor had
                        the United States offered them. As far as we were aware, the situation was
                        that India was deter-mined to develop a supersonic capability and was
                        exploring sources of supply, including the Soviet Union. Our Ambassador had
                        expressed his concern to Indian leaders that they might not fully realize
                        the implications of a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal with the
                        Soviet Union. We did not yet know how the situation would evolve but once
                        again could assure Pakistan there would be no change in United States policy
                        without prior consultation.</p>
                    <p>Turning to a broader aspect of the picture, the Secretary mentioned the
                        possibility that had been discussed in 1959 of joint defense between India
                        and Pakistan and regretted that it had not materialized, in view of the
                        regional nature of the Chinese Communist threat. The Ambassador recounted
                        the history of the joint defense proposal which had come up first after the
                        Chinese occupation of Tibet. <persName>Nehru</persName> at first had
                        rejected it because it would “align” India militarily, but after the Indus
                        Waters settlement had become more favorably disposed towards the idea. The
                        Kashmir's dispute, however, remained the chief obstacle.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then turned to the subject of the Sino-Pakistan border
                        demarcation negotiations. He recalled that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> had discussed <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0283"
                        />the subject with the President last summer and had outlined Pakistan's
                        belief that the negotiation of an agreed border would remove a possible
                        threat to Pakistan from Communist China. The timing of the present
                        announcement was entirely at the initiative of the Communist Chinese. He had
                        no doubt that the Communist Chinese had taken this step to put pressure on
                        India, but said Pakistan had no such intention. The Ambassador said that
                        Pakistan believed India's rights in the matter had been well protected by
                        the terms of the agreement which called for the demarcation of a provisional
                        boundary subject to final approval after the Kashmir issue had been
                        settled.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said it had not been his or his government's intention to
                        question the President's commitment about informing Pakistan of any
                        impending changes in U.S. policy on military assistance to India. He was
                        simply seeking information and clarification because of the many news
                        reports. The Secretary indicated that the Ambassador should not consider his
                        remarks on the subject to be meant in an unfriendly sense.</p>

                        <item>The dominance of the Congress Party in Indian affairs was confirmed in
                            the 1962 elections and during the next few years is unlikely to be
                            threatened by the Communist Party of India (<gloss target="#t_CPI1"
                                >CPI</gloss>) or by the parties which draw support from their
                            regional or religious appeal. (Paras. 5-8.)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>We believe that the ambitious Third Five-Year Plan will be generally
                            successful, enabling India to maintain a satisfactory rate of investment
                                <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0284"/>and at the same time
                            provide a modest increase in living standards. The Plan's success will
                            be heavily dependent on a high level of foreign aid and could be
                            undercut by other factors, such as crop failures, an unexpected decline
                            in exports, or sharply increased defense outlays. (Paras. 9-12)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>India's federal democratic system will be severely tested after the
                            steadying influence of <persName>Nehru</persName> is no longer
                            available. If the central political leadership provided by his
                            successors should prove ineffective, or in the event of a persistent
                            economic crisis, India would experience severe political and social
                            strains. The forces of regionalism and communism would be strengthened.
                            Should the presently nonpolitical Indian military come to believe that
                            competent government and the integrity of the national state were
                            threatened, they probably would feel compelled to intervene. (Paras.

                        <item>India is almost certain to continue its nonalignment policy. US-Indian
                            relations have improved in recent years, and probably will continue to
                            be generally satisfactory, but differences in interest and points of
                            view will from time to time create serious frictions. At the same time,
                            India will continue to attach high priority to maintaining good
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to which it
                            will look for aid and trade, for support on the Kashmir issue, and
                            especially for help in India's problems with Peiping. (Paras.
                            21-25)</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>India now recognizes that its major foreign policy problem for the
                            indefinite future will be centered on the threat of Communist China.
                            Neither side is likely to make sufficient concessions to enable a border
                            settlement to be reached in the near future. India's attempt to force
                            Chinese withdrawal from forward positions in the Ladakh section of
                            Kashmir probably will result in border clashes, though the odds are
                            against any major military escalation. (Paras. 27-28)</item>
                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>Relations with Pakistan, which improved during President <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s first two years in power, have
                            again deteriorated. There has been an upsurge of Hindu-Moslem tensions
                            in both countries, and the Kashmir dispute is once more active. We
                            believe a Kashmir settlement is unlikely and that a further worsening of
                            lndo-Pakistani relations is probable. (Para. 29)</item>
                        <label>G.</label>
                        <item>India is concerned at the establishment of closer relations between
                            Nepal and Communist China. New Delhi will continue its efforts to
                            persuade the Nepalese King of the dangers of this policy and to bring
                            about a rapprochement between him and the disaffected Nepali Congress
                            Party. With respect to southeast Asia, India is unlikely, during the
                            next few years at least, to develop either the will or the capability
                            significantly to affect events in the area, and its policy is likely to
                            amount to little more than urging peace and conciliation. (Paras.

                        the enclosed message<note n="1" xml:id="d128fn1">For text of the telegram as
                            sent, see <ref target="#d129">Document 129</ref>.</note> from you to
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> concerning
                        Indian efforts to a acquire Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's
                        and the possibility of the British offering an alternative.</p>
                    <p>The Government of India has decided at the highest level to begin now to
                        acquire a supersonic fighter capability. For this purpose the Indians have
                        looked into the F-104, Super Mystere (French), Lightnings (British), and the
                            <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21. The Indians are apparently
                        prepared to go ahead with the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's on
                        the basis of the findings of an Indian Mission which has just returned from
                        Moscow. Factors which have led the Indians to this point include political
                        considerations, early availability of the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>'s, payment in Indian rupees and Soviet promises of
                        assistance in future manufacture in India.</p>
                    <p>Should the Indians acquire the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's, the
                        Indian Air Force would be compelled to build its whole fighter aircraft
                        weapons system, of which the airplane itself is only a part, on the Soviet
                        pattern. This would lead probably to the adoption of Soviet bomber and
                        missile systems as being more compatible with the fighter system than would
                        be equipment from the West. In any event, the assignment of large numbers of
                        Soviet technicians to the Indian Air Force would force a withdrawal of the
                        West from those areas where security is a factor (the British are already
                        faced with this problem), inviting further penetration by the Soviets. To
                        have this possibility occur at this time would be particularly unfortunate
                        since senior, basically Western-oriented officers will be retiring in favor
                        of a generation which lacks the strong tradition of close ties with the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> has been assured
                        by Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> that a
                        final decision will not be taken for another ten days. We are certain,
                        however, that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> will be
                        working on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> in the
                        interval to get him to agree to the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        transaction. He can be <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0286"/>expected to
                        bring the Prime Minister to this decision unless a satisfactory Western
                        alternative can be offered.</p>
                    <p>The provision of F-104's is not a feasible alternative at the present because
                        (a) we believe such a move would seriously jeopardize our essential
                        interests in Pakistan, (b)in view of Indian attitudes towards our security
                        procedures we cannot readily provide the necessary associated classified
                        equipment, and (c) India's lack of foreign exchange would make it necessary
                        to provide the equipment under some form of military aid from the United
                        States, a step which would raise major political problems at home and over
                            sea.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">A handwritten note in the margin at

                            await results in London.”</note></p>
                    <p>We have examined other possible Western alternatives and have concluded that
                        we should first explore with the British the possibility of their providing
                        Lightnings. The British traditionally have been India's primary source of

                        Indians are now seriously considering. We believe that such a Soviet entry
                        into India's military picture could have very grave long-range consequences
                        for Indian internal politics. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> discussed this matter with <persName
                            corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord</persName> Hood on Monday and asked whether
                        your Government might be in a position to provide Lightnings as such an
                        alternative. I have thought a great deal about this matter, and this is the
                        only way I can now see to meet a problem which greatly concerns us both. I
                        can well understand that the provision of Lightnings on terms satisfactory
                        to the Indians might give you some difficulties. I should be glad to see how
                        we might assist you in meeting these difficulties.</p>
                    <p>This is, in my view, a very urgent matter. We have indications that a final
                        decision to acquire the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s may be
                        reached in the middle of June so that if at all possible we need to find
                        means of making a counter offer next week.</p>

                                you. One of our difficulties is that it may take a little time to

                                ready to consider diverting existing orders to India, but this in

                            adverse reaction from Pakistan. Though we think that Pakistan would be
                            unlikely to repudiate its Western ties, it would almost certainly
                            manifest a greater degree of “independence” in foreign policy,
                            characterized by a markedly increased intransigence toward the US. In
                            particular, Pakistan would certainly not permit expansion of the special
                            US facilities and would probably impose new restrictions on them.

                    <p>6560. There follows for your information text of Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>'s message to President of June
                        7:</p>
                    <p>Verbatim Text</p>
                    <p>We have now had a very thorough examination of the practical possibilities
                        for making a counter offer of fighters for India.</p>
                    <p>In our view there are two aspects of this matter. One is the question of what
                        fighters the Indians will operate for the next two or three years, and the
                        other is what engines they will use for their own future fighters—H.F. 24.
                        We believe that the most important point for the Free World as a whole is to
                        ensure that the Russians do not secure a position in the industrial and
                        technological field in India by persuading the Indians to accept Russian
                        engines for the H.F. 24. As you probably know, the alternative to this is to
                        develop the Orpheus 12 engine. The cost of this development is expected to
                        be about three million pounds and development of the engine could be kept in
                        phase with development of the H.F. 24 itself. We believe that an agreement
                        for the supply of the Orpheus 12 for the H.F. 24 could be quickly reached
                        with the Indians and we would be prepared to press this on them if your
                        government could renew the agreement to contribute three-quarters of the
                        cost of this development of the engine. In this way I would hope that a
                        joint Anglo-American offer could prevent the main danger from
                        materializing.</p>
                    <p>The immediate problem of providing modern fighters to offset the acquisition
                        by Pakistan of F-104's is, I fear, more difficult. At the moment the English
                        Electric Company's production of Lightnings is planned on the basis of Royal
                        Air Force needs for which indeed production is at present barely adequate.
                        We have made every effort with the company but it is dear that they could
                        not appreciably expand their production in time to help India, as well as to
                        meet our own requirements. Now that countries in the Middle East and Far
                        East have modern Soviet aircraft in service with their own forces, the Royal
                        Air Force cannot afford to be behind and so we must have the Mark II
                        Lightnings as soon as they come off the production line. As I understand it
                        the only practical alternative to the Lightnings are F-104's. I know that
                        the Indians have said that they will not take these aircraft, but I would
                        suggest that you could now put very strong pressure on the Indians to accept
                        F-104's pending the arrival of <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0291"
                        />their own aircraft. After all, they are getting very large sums of money
                        from you which they could not get from anyone else. Could you not represent
                        to them that if they accept Russian offers Congress might resist your
                        proposals for economic aid to India? I would have thought that this would be
                        a very powerful argument.</p>
                    <p>I am sorry that we cannot do better about the Lightnings but I do seriously
                        believe that the question of the engines is more important and that it
                        should be possible to persuade the Indians to accept your F-104's. I would
                        hope that <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName>, who arrives
                        in India about June 16, might be able to deploy the arguments with good
                        effect. End Verbatim Text.</p>

                        info for Ambassador. From the President.</p>
                    <p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>
                    <p>I fully understand your difficulties over Lightning Mark II's for India. I
                        also share your feeling that we must at the very least try to forestall
                        Indian manufacture of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s. However, from
                        the standpoint of US public and congressional reaction and its impact on our
                        aid legislation, an initial <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> purchase
                        will be fully as bad. It may compromise the long-range policy of massive aid
                        to India on which we are embarked.</p>
                    <p>Equally worrisome, we see <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> embarked on a vital test of strength over this issue,
                        and reportedly on the verge of success.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we still regard it as of the highest importance to get in with at
                        least a spoiling offer of aircraft as well as engines by mid-June. We <pb
                            n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0292"/>have again reviewed the F-104
                        possibility, but regretfully conclude that it involves far too much risk of
                        a disastrous Pakistani reaction involving the Peshawar facilities. An offer
                        of F-104 would also play hob on our domestic scene. We are trying out the
                        French on Mirage III's but are dubious that they could come through in
                        time.</p>
                    <p>All this leads me to try once more on Lightnings. Even an offer which was
                        unlikely to be accepted might at least buy us time to dredge up other
                        alternatives. Perhaps you would consider an interim offer of some of the
                        Mark I's and I-A's I understand you have in service, to be replaced later by
                        new models.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to do whatever is necessary within reason to fill any
                        temporary gap in your defenses and to make this tough choice otherwise
                        attractive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> tells
                        me that there are a number of possibilities to this end, including a loan of
                        F-104's for your defense, and I am prepared to have him or some of his top
                        people come over immediately to discuss them with Watkinson. Let me assure
                        you that I would not tackle you again on this issue, if I did not feel
                        strongly that the Indian <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal will have
                        most adverse effects on the interests of us both.</p>

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>The more we consider the question of the fighter programme for the
                            Indian Air Force from the point of view of making an attractive offer to
                            India, the clearer it becomes that the Indians must be even more
                            concerned with possible methods of payment than with the quality or even
                            the cost of goods and services supplied.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>On the particular question you put to me in your last message<note

                                134</ref>.</note> I am of course most grateful for your offer of the
                            loan of F-104s. Accept-ance <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0293"/>of
                            this offer would however present us with serious training and logistic
                            difficulties. We are equally grateful to you for offering to deploy
                            fighter squadrons to cover any gap created here. Perhaps I could leave
                            this over for the time being.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Lightning Mark I's of which we have three squadrons now in front line
                            service in the Royal Air Force would be most unlikely to satisfy Indian
                            requirements. I cannot see the Indians accepting secondhand aircraft
                            however good; also they would need to be refurbished which would take
                            time.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Despite its relatively short range, the Lightning Mark 2 is a better
                            aircraft than the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> because of its
                            superior night fighter capacity. It will cost about #600,000. At a
                            sacrifice which we would only accept because of the major political
                            factors which you mention, we could let the Indians have every other one
                            off the production line; this would give them eight aircraft by the end
                            of 1962 and thereafter two or three a month up to a total of twenty four
                            aircraft.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>In order to avoid our own difficulties with Pakistan we should in any
                            case have to look to the United States Government to meet the difference
                            in cost between these aircraft and the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                                >MIG</gloss> 21s at the price for which the Russians have offered
                            these to India. It remains most important in my view that the Indians
                            should go on with their plans to manufacture H.F. 24s and we therefore
                            consider the developing of the Orpheus 12 engine to be the more
                            important part of our counter-offer to India. I should be grateful for
                            confirmation that the United States will contribute 75 per cent of the
                            cost of development.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I should add that if the Indians commit themselves to a purchase of
                            Lightning Mark 2s they will also need to buy two dual type aircraft for
                            training; an outfit of Fire Streak air-to-air missile and a flight
                            simulator: the total bill for these additional requirements would amount
                            to some five million pounds.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The major problem still remains. It is clearly quite impossible for
                            India to pay us for the aircraft (even at three hundred thousand pounds
                            each) and the training facilities and ammunition to a total amount of
                            twelve million pounds except in blocked rupees, which are of no use to
                            us and with which British firms are already embarrassingly well
                            supplied. In our present economic situation I am unable to agree to what
                            amounts to a free gift to India on this scale.</item>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0294"/>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The solution would be for you to meet the full cost of supplying the
                            aircraft. The only alternative that we can see is that these goods and
                            services should be supplied to India in replacements for an equivalent
                            amount of civil aid under existing aid programmes. I suspect that there
                            would be considerable fractional difficulties about this, but in any
                            case it is obviously not a suggestion which the Indian Government would
                            accept unless they realized that by buying <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                                >MIG</gloss>s they run the risk of curtailment or cessation of
                            American aid which I mentioned in my message to you of June 7.<note

                        <item>My conclusion therefore is that the only factor which might bring the
                            Indians to heel would be the fear of losing a substantial part of the
                            large scale aid which they receive from the United States. It seems to
                            us therefore that the best course might be for you to send a personal
                            message to <persName>Nehru</persName> warning him that a decision by
                            India to buy armaments from Russia might prejudice the attitude of
                            Congress so gravely as to endanger seriously India's future prospects of
                            obtaining continuing aid on the present scale from the United
                            States.</item>

                            above, and also to learn what reply you have had from the French about
                            the possibility of their supplying Mirages.<note n="300"
                                xml:id="d135fn3">The French Embassy informed the Department on June
                                9 that France would have difficulty in offering to supply two
                                squadrons of Mirage II fighters to India. The difficulty lay in a
                                currency problem. The French were concerned that to sell for Indian
                                rupees or on soft terms could not be kept secret and would have
                                undesirable effects on French sales in other parts of the world.

                    <p>The President was opposed to subsidizing the sale of two Lightning Mark II
                        squadrons to India for rupees, at a likely cost of around $60 million.</p>
                    <p>Instead he approved telling Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName> that we would be willing to share 50/50 the hard
                        currency cost of one Lightning squadron. We would also finance 75 per cent
                        of the further development cost of the Orpheus engine, if the Indians
                        accepted the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> offer. To complete the
                        package, he approved a simultaneous US offer to sell India nine C-130
                        transports for rupees. All of the above are contingent upon the Indians not
                        buying the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21.</p>
                    <p>The President directed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> make a strong presentation to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> on the likely blow to US aid prospects if the
                        Indians bought <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. He agreed to send a
                        personal letter to <persName>Nehru</persName> for <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> to present after his first talk
                        with <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President desired that we tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> frankly why we were trying to forestall an Indian
                        purchase of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. He expressed willingness
                        to write <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> a personal letter to
                        try to disarm him. He reserved judgment on the suggestion that we attempt to
                        placate <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> by offering him the
                        public security reassurances he has been seeking.</p>

                    <p>6679. Please transmit urgently following message from President to Prime
                        Minister:</p>
                    <p>We are most appreciative of your willingness to come up with a Lightning Mark
                        II offer, despite the real sacrifice involved. I am concerned, however, lest
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s press conference remarks mean that he has
                        all but made up his mind to buy <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. The
                        unfortunate leak to The New York Times from Delhi also suggests that it will
                        be difficult to keep the US role in any counter-offer from being too
                        transparent and exposing us to a strong Pakistani as well as domestic US
                        reaction which may jeopardize other programs.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, I still believe that it is in our mutual interest to forestall
                        if possible a crucial step toward Indian acceptance of the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a main source of arms supply. Even if
                        we fail in this endeavor, we want to deprive hostile elements in India of
                        the argument that India had no reasonable alternative.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we emphatically support the Orpheus engine offer, and will finance
                        75 per cent of the three million pounds additional you estimate is required
                        to develop it.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we believe that it is equally important to offer some aircraft
                        in order to provide an alternative comparable to the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss> offer. We share your view that reasonably comparable soft
                        currency terms will also carry great weight with the Indians, and that we
                        should allow payment in rupees to the extent necessary.</p>
                    <p>In reflecting we have looked again at the possibility of offering to provide
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> transport aircraft, on which his need
                        vis-a-vis the Communist Chinese is much more valid than for the fighters,
                        and where the Pakistani reaction would be minimized. Accordingly, I conclude
                        that the farthest we should now go is to offer to sell India a single
                        squadron (12 aircraft) of the Lightning Mark II, for rupees at a stated
                        price of perhaps 300,000 pounds, plus accessories which we suppose would be
                        about 3 million pounds or a little more than half of the 5 million estimate
                        for the two squadrons. In addition, we on the US side would offer to provide
                        nine C-130 transports as a sale for rupees. This latter would of course be
                            <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0297"/>left to <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>, but <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> could refer to indications from us in this
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>If you were prepared to do this, we would hope that you could bear one-half
                        of the real cost of the fighters, which would total about 10.2 million
                        pounds. We would make up the rest through some means involving greater
                        participation in military research projects, or through some economic aid
                        sharing, or a combination of the two. Our joint interests are such, as I am
                        sure you will agree, that we should not hesitate to reallocate financial
                        responsibilities in order to advance our common interests or minimize our
                        common difficulties. I trust that these assurances are sufficient so that
                        you can go ahead with an offer of twelve Lightnings as well as the
                        Orpheus.</p>
                    <p>We are of course anxious to forestall a violent Pakistani reaction, for
                        reasons I have mentioned. In our approach to the Pakistanis, we should both
                        tell them frankly that it is to save them and us from something worse, i.e.,
                        a major Soviet re-equipment of the Indians of a nature we cannot
                        control.</p>
                    <p>Let me also assure you that we are bending every effort to bring home to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> how a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        purchase might gravely prejudice Congressional approval of continued massive
                        US aid. I had already sent a brief message to <persName>Nehru</persName>,
                        and am instructing <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> to make
                        a full-scale assault as soon as he returns. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> too could certainly mention the great concern in
                        Washington lest a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal undermine our
                        whole aid program.</p>
                    <p>The French reaction is negative so far. But I think you will agree that we
                        should give India the impression, if possible, that there is more than one
                        Western alternative to <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. Hence we will
                        continue explorations with the French.</p>
                    <p>With warm regards.</p>

                        <p>We have maintained a close and for the most part friendly alliance with
                            Pakistan since 1954. We and Pakistan have mutually benefited by this

                            Recent strains on both partners have caused both to re-examine the value

                        <p>There exists between the U.S. and Pakistan an extensive range of
                            scientific, cultural, educational, military and political common
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The basic objective of U.S. policy toward Pakistan is to insure to the
                            best of our ability its continued existence as an independent nation
                            with a healthy economic development firmly integrated in the
                            non-communist world. We have assisted Pakistan on a massive basis
                            economically and militarily, and to a lesser extent politically. We have
                            guaranteed Pakistan's security against aggression from any quarter. In
                            return we have asked Pakistan to allow us to maintain in the country
                            military communications and intelligence facilities which we consider
                            vital to our national interests. We expect Pakistan to stand with us
                            politically on the major issues dividing the free world from the
                            communist bloc; and stand with us militarily to the extent that it can
                            contribute to regional collective security within the framework of
                                <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss

                        <p>The basic objectives of Pakistan policy toward the U.S. are to insure
                            that it can maintain a military capability sufficient to prevent its
                            neighbors, most particularly India, from attempting solutions of
                            outstanding disputes by force; and that it can undertake its much needed
                            economic development under the general protection of the U.S. against
                            the long-range communist threat to its existence.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan has granted us facilities, the existence of which have brought
                            regional pressure and specific threats of war-like action to bear
                            against it. Pakistan has stood up firmly, after the U-2 incident for
                            example, to this pressure. Pakistan has stood with us on every major
                            political issue except the question of admission of Communist China to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In return Pakistan has asked us for economic and military assistance, and
                            strong political and moral support on those issues which it considers
                            vital to its existence as an independent nation, principally Kashmir and
                            to a lesser degree the Pakistan-Afghanistan border problem.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. Background</hi></p>
                        <p>The course of U.S.-Pakistan relations has been irregular over the last
                            several years. At times when interests seemed to coincide, or when one
                            of the partners in the alliance had a particular need, relations have
                            been excellent. At other times when doubt and frustration on the part of
                            Pakistan as to the validity and utility of its commitment has caused it
                            to question the alliance, or when our irritation at some particular
                            action of Pakistan's made us do likewise, relations have worsened
                            appreciably. We are currently in a low period similar to the one
                            existing before President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                            visit to the U.S. in 1961. At that time Pakistan considered the new
                            Administration to be so biased in favor of India as to be detrimental to
                            Pakistan's interests.</p>

                        <p>However, U.S.-Pakistan relations improved markedly as a result of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s visit during
                            which both countries were reassured as to the good intentions of the
                            other. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> left the
                            U.S. with these understandings on the subjects of his main

                        <p>The U.S. had no current intention of changing its policy on providing
                            military assistance to India and would not unless circumstances in the
                            area altered—for example, if an increased military threat to India from
                            Communist China became apparent. In any case, the U.S. would not change
                            its policy without prior consultation with Pakistan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi></p>
                        <p>There was a fundamental disagreement between the U.S. and Pakistan on how
                            Pakistan should deal with Afghanistan, but the U.S. would not stand in
                            the way of a Pakistan attempt to deal firmly with the Afghans.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Communist China</hi></p>
                        <p>The U.S. knew that Pakistan was planning to demarcate its northern border
                            with Communist China in order to prevent a situation similar to the one
                            in Ladakh from arising in Pakistan.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic and Military Assistance</hi></p>
                        <p>The U.S. intended to undertake a thorough look at Pakistan's waterlogging
                            and salinity problem with a view to seeing whether we could not start a
                            practical program to solve it. The U.S. planned to be similarly
                            forthcoming with regard to its other assistance programs, including our
                            part in the Indus Waters scheme and the Second Five Year Plan.
                            Concerning military assistance, the U.S. planned to maintain its current
                            policy and, in addition, supply a squadron of C-130 transport
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>On our side we had substantially the same understandings except for the
                            one in Afghanistan. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> left the impression that, when he spoke of dealing
                            firmly with the Afghans, he was referring to military reprisals by
                            Pakistan against Afghan incursions into Pakistan territory rather than
                            any political actions.</p>

                        <p>Our relations with Pakistan took a turn for the worse about a month after
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s visit when Pakistan
                            unilaterally and brusquely ordered Afghanistan to close its consulates
                            and trade agencies in Pakistan. Afghanistan thereupon broke off
                            relations with Pakistan and sealed the common border, which has remained
                            closed, except for eight weeks, ever since September 6, 1961. Despite
                            our good offices, including Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName>'s mission, the situation remains unresolved. We
                            continue to consider that, despite Afghanistan's illogical and stubborn
                            policy, Pakistan has played into the hands of the Soviet Union by its
                            pre-emptory action.</p>

                        <p>The President attempted without success in November to get
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> to negotiate on Kashmir. Because of this,
                            and spurred on by what appeared to be a genuine fear of Indian
                            aggressive intent after the Indian seizure of Goa, Pakistan carried
                            through on its plan to take the Kashmir issue to the Security Council,
                            although delaying this move several times at our request while we tried
                            various ways of getting Pakistan and India together—including the
                            President's proposal to send <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Eugene
                                Black</persName> on a good offices mission. There is a definite
                            feeling among Pakistanis—officials and private citizens alike—that we
                            have not lived up fully to the President's commitment to support
                            Pakistan in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Recent efforts by
                                <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> may have changed this opinion
                            to some extent among Pakistan officials, but the general belief remains
                            among the people that the U.S. has let Pakistan down.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. Military Assistance to India</hi></p>
                        <p>Pakistan's distrust of U.S. intentions was heightened in May by reports
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> had
                            attempted to counter an Indian plan to acquire <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                                >MIG</gloss>-21's from the Soviet Union by offering to provide
                            F-104's. The fact that India was attempting to build a supersonic
                            capability revived the fear that had been aroused by the Goa take-over.
                            The U.S. has attempted to allay this fear in several ways after Goa,
                            including a confidential renewal of U.S. security guarantees for
                            Pakistan which were contained in a letter from the President to
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> last January.<note n="3"

                            Despite these assurances, Pakistanis at all levels continue to distrust

                            Menon</persName>—and appear to be genuinely apprehensive at the

                        <p>When Pakistan and Communist China announced jointly in May that they
                            intended to negotiate the border between Pakistan-held Kashmir and
                            Singhiang Province, India reacted sharply in the belief that both
                            Pakistan and Communist China were attempting to put pressure on India.
                            Although the U.S. has maintained official silence on the subject, early
                            press reports gave Pakistan officials the idea that the U.S. was
                            displeased at Pakistan action. The Pakistan Ambassador here and the
                            Pakistan Foreign Secretary in Karachi have gone to great lengths to
                            justify Pakistan's policy on this matter.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. Economic and Military Assistance</hi></p>
                        <p>Pakistan was greatly reassured by U.S. support which resulted in the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> Consortium's pledging the full
                            amount requested for the first two years of the Second Five Year Plan.
                            However, the delay in issuance of the report from Dr.
                                <persName>Wiesner</persName>'s office on salinity, and the revisions
                            that have had to be made on the Indus Waters scheme have aroused doubts
                            in Pakistan as to the validity of our commitments. On the military side
                            Pakistan defense officials desire to maintain close association with the
                            U.S. but are worried that we do not reciprocate. Washington rumors and
                            delays in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> programming and
                            deliveries have accentuated these fears. Pakistan defense officials have
                            also been putting pressure on us in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                                >CENTO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and within
                            the framework of our bilateral understanding to engage in contingency
                            planning against possible attack from India or Afghanistan.</p>
                        <p>The accumulation of doubt and frustration in Pakistan as a result of the
                            foregoing has led politically aware Pakistanis to question the value of
                            Pakistan's alliance just at a time when a measure of political freedom
                            returned to the country after over three and a half years of martial
                            law. The newly convened National Assembly will have some restraint on
                            the power of the Executive and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> will thus have to be responsive or at least alert
                            to its wishes. He will not be able to make decisions affecting
                            Pakistan's foreign policy posture without being more responsive to the
                            pressure of public opinion than he has in the past. There have been some
                            recent indications of a possible reappraisal by Pakistan of its
                            alignment with the West. Logically, however, it would seem that Pakistan
                            has really no practical alternative to its alliance with the U.S.
                            Despite increasingly bold opposition, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> can be expected to follow substantially the same

                            critical. It has seemed that Pakistan is asking for more from us than we
                            are prepared to give in order to maintain our special relationship.
                            Furthermore, Pakistan's actions have at times seemed to have been taken
                            without sufficient consultation with us and there has been an increasing
                            breakdown of communication.</p>
                        <p>Some of the major irritants have been listed above—i.e.,
                            Pakistan-Afghanistan impasse, Kashmir, Pakistan-Chinese Communist
                            relations, differing views on <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. In connection with the
                            latter organization, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                            recently failed to respond to the U.S. suggestion to send token forces
                            to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>We too have been taking stock of the alliance in the light of the
                            unsatisfactory relations of the past year. Pakistan seems determined to
                            try to limit U.S. freedom of action with respect to India and to a
                            lesser extent, with respect to Afghanistan. The present judgment is that
                            the value of our special relationship with Pakistan, particularly in the
                            military field, is such that we cannot contemplate withdrawal from the
                            alliance. We cannot, furthermore, yet accept the dissolution of <gloss
                                target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss>, which might follow if Pakistan on its side
                            withdrew.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>We recognize the difficulties which we face ahead in trying
                            simultaneously to maintain our relationship with Pakistan and to develop
                            an increasingly effective relationship with India. Nevertheless,
                            continuation of the alliance is in our interest. Not only is a free and
                            cooperative Pakistan essential to the stability and security of South
                            Asia and to our presence there, but there is no satisfactory alternative
                            site for our facilities which are vital to our national interest.</p>

                                message of June 18 to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                                reported on two “difficult” conversations that British Commonwealth
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> had
                                with <persName>Nehru</persName> concerning the Indian desire to
                                purchase supersonic aircraft. <persName>Nehru</persName> stated that
                                the F-104 fighters supplied to Pakistan by the United States had
                                created a strong public demand in India for comparable aircraft. Of
                                the Western aircraft being considered, the Indian military viewed
                                the British Lightning fighter as least suited to their needs. Only
                                the Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>, in
                                    <persName>Nehru</persName>'s view, could be produced and offered
                                at a price India could afford. An offer of Western aircraft at a
                                comparable price would amount to military assistance and compromise
                                India's neutrality. (Telegram 6781 to London, June 18; Department of

                                concerned about the strong U.S. and British reactions to the
                                projected purchase of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, and
                                would be glad to find a way to resolve the issue that did not

                                ibid., 791.5622/6-1962)</note> on a counter-offer to forestall

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName>'s arguments as to why
                            we couldn't sell F-104s to India for rupees, even though it was
                            technically feasible to do so. These were chiefly the likely strong
                            Pakistani reaction, which might even lead to restrictions on our key
                            intelligence facilities, and secondarily the likely Congressional
                            reaction. The President agreed to tell <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> that we would pay more than half the hard
                            currency costs of a Lightning squadron if necessary, especially if we
                            could find some way to minimize the dollar drain involved.</item>

                            explained how he would propose to explain our maneuvers to <persName

                            outcome in Delhi. The President instructed Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> to tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> in the event our counter-offer
                            seemed likely to be accepted that we were serving Pakistani interests as
                            well as ours, and that a Western-controlled supply of jets to India was
                            infinitely preferable to uncontrolled reliance on Soviet sources. On the
                            other hand, if the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal went <pb
                                n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0305"/>through we should tell them
                            that it didn't change the military balance much (as a hedge against new
                            Pakistani requests for jets), and explain that counter offers to India
                            had been in an attempt to spoil this deal. The President was dubious
                            about giving more jets to the Pakistani regardless of what
                            happened.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The desirability of meeting the Pakistani request for bilateral joint
                            planning vis-a-vis India and Afghanistan was discussed. Although
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> pointed
                            out how the Pakistani argued that this was purely contingency planning
                            of the sort any two allied general staffs would normally carry out, the
                            President was opposed to our engaging in any joint planning which might
                            leak to the Indians and suggest that we were planning with the Paks
                            against them.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> noted the Pakistani
                            desire for a public US guarantee of Pakistan's security against Indian
                            aggression. He felt that reiteration of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                >Pak</gloss> guarantee in some form might be essential to mollify
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> if we and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> supplied planes to India. The President
                            said he was extremely reluctant to give any new commitments to the
                            Pakistani; he queried why we got into such commitments in the first
                            place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> briefly
                            explained the history of our past “guarantees” to Pakistan and
                            India.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> suggested that if we could
                        get the two countries, perhaps in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        discussion on Kashmir, to make public statements disavowing any intention of
                        attacking each other, the US could then come out with a public statement
                        noting these declarations and “guaranteeing” the security of each in event
                        of aggression by the other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName>
                        noted that our main objective in supplying such security reassurances to
                        Pakistan was to forestall their “doing something” to our Peshawar facilities
                        in retaliation for what they regarded as pro-Indian US actions. The
                        President reserved judgment on any such idea, and asked that it be studied
                        further when the occasion arose.</p>
                    <p>The President said that perhaps he ought to have one more meeting with
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> before the latter
                        returned to Pakistan; he also thought that he might write a letter to

                        sufficiently to get the whole question put into cold storage for a while.
                        However, we are not sanguine at this point that even
                            <persName>Desai</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                            >Radhakrishnan</persName> will be able to match <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s inevitable counter-arguments. We
                        need to strengthen the hand of our friends as much as possible at this
                        critical juncture.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, while I agree with you that we need not reach any irrevocable
                        decisions now about what we are prepared to offer the Indians, I believe
                        that we should dangle a bit more bait before them than <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> felt able to do. A spoiling offer of
                        this sort seems all the more important to me if we think
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> is unlikely to buy it. It seems to me that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> might best save face by rejecting what both
                        sides have to offer at this point. And even if he ultimately buys <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s we want to put our friends in India in a
                        position to say in the event of an aid cut or other adverse consequences
                        that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> and his
                        supporters brought down disaster on India by pushing through the <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal despite the fact of a reasonable
                        alternative.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> too thinks there is some
                        chance that if we make enough of a fuss about their taking <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, combined with a good counter offer, the
                        Indians may end up taking neither in the immediate months ahead. This would
                        be the best outcome by far.</p>
                    <p>However, <persName>Nehru</persName>'s response to <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> confirms our feeling that to offer the Orpheus engine
                        alone would not suffice even for our minimum purposes. Therefore, it still
                        seems important to us that some supersonic fighters be at least tentatively
                        offered as well. The Mirage seems out and we are not able to sell 104's for
                        rupees at this time. On the one hand, we fear that if the US provided this
                        type of equipment to India for the first time, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> would be unable to contain a Pakistani reaction which
                        might endanger our use of the key facilities of which you are aware. On the
                        other hand, <persName>Nehru</persName> would be least likely of all, from
                        his domestic political viewpoint, to consider an offer of 104's from us as a
                        real alternative to that from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We
                        also would have a most difficult domestic problem. <pb n="281"
                            xml:id="pg_281" facs="0307"/>Finally, either the Mirage or 104 would
                        involve the same element of subsidy to which <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        objects. So we are thrust back on the Lightning.</p>
                    <p>Let me add that <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> has just
                        come in from Delhi urging that a plausible alternative beyond the Orpheus
                        remains essential if <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> is not to
                        have a clear hand. As I see it, only Lightnings offer this alternative.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons, I hope you can agree to indicating to the Indians that if
                        they are interested you are prepared to discuss with them a sale of one
                        squadron of Lightnings on reasonably competitive terms. If the financial
                        side of the package we proposed gives you serious problems, I am prepared to
                        pick up a greater share of the cost, especially if the dollar drain can be
                        minimized; however, I recognize that the Indians might not accept Lightnings
                        in any event.</p>
                    <p>In the last analysis, you and I share a great responsibility for attempting
                        to forestall an expanded Soviet military presence in the sub-continent. We
                        only press the Lightning offer upon you because a comparable Western
                        alternative to <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, even if not accepted,
                        seems so important to keeping up the pressure which we both agree is
                        essential at this point.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2"><persName

                    <p>4119. Eyes Only for President. I met <persName>Nehru</persName> for an hour
                        at 7:15 and, subject to finding a definite alternative to <gloss

                        Though looking tired <persName>Nehru</persName> was alert and seemed less
                        affected by his illness than I had expected. Except <pb n="282"

                        entire discussion was on the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. I made
                        these points: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>That our concern was with effect acquisition on Indian reputation
                                for neutrality and nonalignment and political effect in US.
                                Interpretation was more important than the fact. I noted that word
                                    <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> like U-boat was highly
                                evocative and that we hadn't raised objection to 12s or
                                helicopters.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>That purchase would be for rupees and no one, myself included,
                                would perceive that food sales for rupees was aid while airplane
                                sales for rupees a commercial transaction.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>[apparent omission] Expensive and sophisticated weapons in the
                                area, that we continued to believe the main chance lay with economic
                                development which these planes put in double jeopardy by adverse
                                Congressional reaction as well as diversion of resources.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>In response <persName>Nehru</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>s had come to attention in normal course of looking at
                        supersonic fighters. Investigating officers “not at all pro-Soviet” found
                        them simpler and better suited to manufacture in India than American,
                        British, French. He cited particular doubts about the Lightning. Indians
                        were also attracted by the price. He then said he appreciated our reaction
                        and the problem that the purchase would present for the President vis-a-vis
                        the Congress and public.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of aid he tried somewhat unenthusiastically to insist this was
                        a commercial purchase and the rupees would soon be spent in the normal
                        course of events. I responded with an argument previously used that this put
                        a curious interpretation on our restraint on spending rupees. In the end, I
                        think he rather yielded the point.</p>
                    <p><persName>Nehru</persName> then said that he was of two minds on buying such
                        equipment and perhaps they were safer without it. He agreed only because
                        Pakistan had the planes, recalling his refusal of an offer of planes by
                        Eisenhower. I took the occasion to give him a fill-in on background of arms
                        aid to Pakistanis, the technical limitations of supersonic fighters and to
                        minimize the importance of the resulting Pakistan air power. I noted that we
                        were not offering India 104s because we accepted her policy of nonalignment.
                        We would be in a poor position to protest aid from the Soviets that impaired
                        that policy if we offered it ourselves.</p>
                    <p>There was a good deal more discussion in this vein but the foregoing will
                        give the general flavor. Toward the end the following 3 points of importance
                        emerged: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item><persName>Nehru</persName> said that no offer has been made by the
                                Soviets and no negotiations have been entered into. In response to a
                                direct question he said that while despatch of an investigating team
                                was being considered there would be “no decision in the immediate
                                future or the near future.”</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>I asked him to consider a British counter-offer on comparable
                                terms, including the Orpheus, and noted our willingness should the
                                    <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0309"/>need arise to help on
                                dual-purposes materiel relative to the Northern border. While I
                                mentioned the C-130 as an example, I left the numbers fuzzy,
                                recalling that we had previously helped him out with similar
                                equipment. He said he would consider British offer.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>He said that <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> had
                                reminded him of the promise to consult before going to the Soviets
                                for planes, a promise which he said had slipped his mind. He had
                                given promise at behest of Mountbatten, implying that it wouldn't
                                have been given to anyone else. He left me with the impression that
                                he intends rather reluctantly to honor it.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I have the impression of substantial progress in getting the deal postponed.
                        This is on the assumption of a counter-offer which it will be evident was
                        always essential in the background and, needless to say, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> will bend every effort to remove the
                        block when he gets back, and his ability to do so is of course related to
                        the Prime Minister's susceptible state of health. During the next few days I
                        will talk with <persName corresp="#p_DM1">Morarji Desai</persName> and,
                        should he initiate the discussion, with TTK, but I must avoid seeming to
                        build up a campaign. The press swarmed over me after my meeting and in view
                        of the special sensitivity of our role in this matter I said nothing either
                        on the record, off the record, or for background and would urge the same
                        curious [cautious?] policy on Washington.</p>

                        election year here we have been having particular trouble with aid

                        moment in getting largely restored, and Poland and Yugoslavia where we have
                        come to expect trouble, we had a serious setback on payments to the
                        Philippines. This was particularly indicative of the Congressional mood for
                        our good relations with that country have always been an especial source of
                        pride in the Congress and throughout the US.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> told the Ambassador that
                        he wanted to describe in general terms the efforts on the part of the U.S.
                        and the U.K. to forestall Soviet penetration of the Indian military
                        establishment by the provision of <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that we saw the
                        situation as follows: India has a threat to its borders from Communist
                        China; to meet this threat and to balance its air strength with Pakistan's
                        F-104s, India had been seriously considering acquiring a supersonic
                        capability; and we and the U.K. thought that, if India was determined to
                        acquire these planes, it would be better for the planes to come from the
                        West. We believed Soviet influence in the Indian Air Force undesirable, and
                        further believed if there were no alternatives to the Soviets, <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s hand would be strengthened
                        in the coming struggle for succession in India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that, for the
                        foregoing reasons, the U.S. and the U.K. had been discussing the possibility
                        of the U.S. selling India some unspecified transport aircraft and of the
                        U.K. selling some Lightning aircraft. In addition the U.K. was considering
                        the offer of an engine that India could manufacture. He pointed out that
                        both we and the U.K. had supplied India with this type of equipment in the
                        past. He made no specific mention of terms of payment. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> emphasized the U.S. conviction that
                        we and the U.K. were acting in Pakistan's interest as well as our own in
                        this regard.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> said his government
                        disagreed on the seriousness of the Indian threat from the north.
                        Furthermore, India had been informed in May 1960 that Pakistan was going to
                        get F-104s and was only now raising a howl about it. The Ambassador said his
                        government believed India's real motive in getting jets was to increase its
                        strength toward Pakistan. The Indian seizure of Goa, the several bellicose
                        and belligerent <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0312"/>statements made by
                        Indian political leaders during the past six months, and now this attempt to
                        get supersonic planes all convinced Pakistan that India meant to threaten it
                        rather than Communist China.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that there would be an adverse effect on public opinion
                        in Pakistan if the West supplied supersonic aircraft to India. His
                        government was not really convinced that the Soviets had made a genuine
                        offer, and believed the Indians might be using the threat of an offer as a
                        means of bringing pressure to bear on the West to make a counter offer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> interrupted to say that,
                        according to intelligence available to us, the Soviets were prepared to
                        supply <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s to India if asked, and would
                        do so rather quickly if the Indians accepted the offer.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> said that, in any
                        case, a Western offer, if accepted, will amount to a grant of military
                        assistance to India. The people of Pakistan would view this as an unfriendly
                        act perpetrated by two countries—i.e., the U.S. and the U.K., who are
                        supposed to be Pakistan's allies. Pakistan believed that if India was
                        determined to have supersonic jets, it would be better if they came from the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> rather than the West. This would
                        at least widen the split between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and Communist China. If, on the other hand, the planes come from the West,
                        tensions will mount between Pakistan and India because the latter will feel
                        free to take a tougher line on Kashmir than in the past.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that Pakistan should
                        be less rather than more apprehensive if India got planes from the West
                        since the West would be in a position to limit the supply. He added that the
                        U.S. doubts that India has any intention of committing aggression against
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> reminded <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName> that on May 28 the Ambassador had
                        expressed the concern of his government that an Indian supersonic
                        acquisition would result in a serious military imbalance in South Asia. The
                        U.S. and the U.K. are trying to prevent just such a situation since, once
                        Soviets are in the field, they can, and probably will, aggravate any
                        imbalance to suit their own purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1"
                            >Grant</persName> added that we see three advantages to the Western
                        counter offer: (1) anti-<persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> forces
                        in India will be strengthened; (2) there is a possibility of a long delay
                        before the Indians make up their minds to take either plane; and (3) even if
                        the Western offer is accepted there will be less chance of a real imbalance
                        being created.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> replied that a long
                        delay was unlikely, because both <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> had made this a prestige
                        issue. The serious thing, as far as Pakistan is concerned, is that the West
                        is setting a new pattern by this offer to supply arms to India. The West has
                        no assurances that, even if India accepts the Western offer this time, the
                        Indians would not later turn to the Soviets for different types of military
                        aid. India would thus have the means of putting almost unlimited pressure on
                        the <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0313"/>West. In Pakistan the
                        difference between U.S. policy towards allies and neutrals would be further
                        blurred.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> said that the central
                        problem remained to prevent a major additional imbalance in the
                        subcontinent. We have had and continue to have the closest sort of
                        relationship with Pakistan as an ally. We believe we are acting in
                        Pakistan's best interests.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said there was a basic
                        contradiction in Pakistan's position. On the one hand it wanted to prevent
                        or minimize an imbalance and on the other it believed it would be preferable
                        to have the planes come from the Soviet Union. Such an arrangement would
                        establish an open-ended channel for an Indian military buildup.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked what specifically he could tell his government. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> said that the U.S. and
                        the U.K. had been discussing means of forestalling the Soviet attempt to
                        provide India with <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21s. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> had had separate conversations
                        with <persName>Nehru</persName> and had each elaborated on the possible
                        adverse consequences for India of a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21
                        transaction. They had encouraged <persName>Nehru</persName> to explore the
                        possibility of Western alternatives before making a decision. No specific
                        offer to India had been made and no financial terms had been discussed.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName> for the information.</p>

                    <p>You will recall that the genesis of our intimate involvement with the Kashmir
                        dispute before the Security Council arose during Pakistani President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s visit to the United States
                        last year. Among other things <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        felt that he had received a commitment from the President to support
                        Pakistan if the issue of Kashmir were raised by Pakistan in the Security
                        Council. After India had rejected the <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                            >Black</persName> mission, Pakistan, against the advice of the United
                        States, in fact brought the Kashmir issue to the Security Council. It soon
                        became clear that Pakistan expected the United States to assume a major
                        active responsibility for advancing Pakistan's position and that an
                        excessively broad interpretation was being placed by Pakistan on the
                        President's commitment. Accordingly, the Department sought to limit
                        Pakistan's interpretation that the United States should actively manage the
                        Kashmir issue in the Security Council to a successful conclusion (Pakistan
                        is not a member of the Security Council). A working definition of the
                        President's commitment was, therefore, agreed in the Department and
                        transmitted by memorandum for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge

                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“With respect to the Security Council, we believe the United States
                                is committed to sympathetic consideration of and support for any
                                Pakistan initiatives in the Security Council which advance a
                                settlement of the problem. This would include sponsorship of a
                                Pakistan draft resolution even if it were to draw a Soviet veto. We
                                would vote in favor of resolutions which are consonant with the
                                earlier United Nations resolutions (<gloss target="#t_UNCIP1"
                                    >UNCIP</gloss>) and attempt to enlist support among other
                                members of the Security Council for such resolutions. The United
                                States is not committed, in our view, to vote in favor of any
                                resolution which radically departs from the intent of the earlier
                                resolutions, although we would, of course, examine any such
                                resolution on its merits.”</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, our Mission in New York had been instructed to encourage the
                        Pakistani Delegation to put forward its own proposals and resolutions which
                        we would then hope to be able to support. The reason behind this instruction
                        was that, in view of the excessive interpretation by Pakistan of the
                        President's commitment, it was important to make clear to the Pakistanis
                        that we were in fact discharging the commitment, once and for all. This
                        tactic proved effective and on May 15, 1962, <persName>Zafrulla</persName>
                        Khan, the Pakistani Representative at the United Nations, presented the
                        United States Delegation with two texts of resolutions.
                            <persName>Zafrulla</persName> at the same time also informed our
                        Delegation that he would see the Irish representative, Ambassador Boland, on
                        the next day and seek his sponsorship of a resolution (New York's

                        our Ambassador underscored our offer to sponsor and work for the adoption of
                        either draft resolution as a significant affirmative decision on our part in
                        implementation of the President's assurances to President <persName

                    <p>Pursuant to Zafrulla's initiative, Ambassador Boland of Ireland together with
                        the United Nations representatives of Ghana, Chile, Venezuela, and the
                        United Arab Republic attempted to draft a resolution acceptable both to
                        Pakistan and India. Behind the scenes we strongly encouraged this initiative
                        to have others sponsor the resolution and worked to assure a feasible text.
                        On June 5 the Boland drafting group (the so-called Little Five) made its
                        final drafting concession to the Indian position by changing a specific
                        reference to third-party assistance to a broader reference to Article 33 of
                        the Charter. This was done in an attempt to keep the Little Five together in
                        the face of the wavering <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Delegate (New
                        York's 3913).<note n="5" xml:id="d144fn5">Dated June 5. (Ibid.,
                            690D.91/6-562)</note> However, unrelenting Indian counterpressure
                        against this resolution was being exerted in the Little Five capitals, in
                        New York and in New Delhi where <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> charged that the Little Five were fronting for the

                            xml:id="d144fn6">Dated June 8. (Ibid., 690D.91/6-862)</note></p>
                    <p>By the time <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> had arrived in New
                        York on June 17 the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Ghana had
                        already decided not to co-sponsor the compromise resolution. The Chilean
                        representative had also backed out of sponsorship on his own initiative,
                        thus reducing the Little Five to Ireland and Venezuela. Although the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and Ghana defections had been expected to
                        occur despite our persistent efforts, the Chilean action was an unpleasant
                        surprise. Further efforts were being taken to hold the group together when
                        the Venezuelan Delegate, expecting to be a candidate for a high General
                        Assembly office in 1963, showed signs of losing his nerve before <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s onslaught. Accordingly, on June
                        19, the Department telephoned the Embassies in Caracas and Santiago to
                        request that the Venezuelan and Chilean representatives co-sponsor, or in
                        the case of the Chilean representative, at least vote for the compromise
                        resolution (Deptel to Caracas 1295, Santiago 1004).<note n="7"

                        Delegate had an absolutely free hand (Caracas 1475).<note n="9"

                        Presumably in the interests of his personal aspirations this Delegate then
                        exercised his free hand to withdraw from co-sponsorship, at which stage the
                        Irish Delegate expressed unwillingness to be the sole sponsor. Our Mission
                        immediately made a further effort, assisted by the Irish and French
                        Delegates, to persuade the Venezuelan Delegate to co-sponsor but he flatly
                        refused. In order to keep the resolution alive, our Delegation later that
                        afternoon (June 20) discussed the entire situation with the Pakistani
                        Delegation and acceded to its request that the United States sponsor alone,
                        if necessary, the Little Five text (New York's 4071).<note n="10"

                        steps were then taken. In order to maintain pressure for the Chilean
                        affirmative vote, essential to a Security Council majority, our Embassy in
                        Santiago again was instructed to approach the Foreign Office and by
                        telephone on June 21 the Embassy reported the Chilean Delegate had a free
                        hand. Meanwhile, the Irish and British Delegations had, at our Mission's
                        behest, recommended to their governments that they be permitted to
                        co-sponsor with the United States. A rapid response was received the morning
                        of June 21—the Irish could not co-sponsor with the United States; the
                        British would if we requested them to do so. Simultaneously our Embassy in
                        New Delhi warned against US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> co-sponsorship
                        (New Delhi's 4131).<note n="11" xml:id="d144fn11">Dated June 21. (Ibid.,

                    <p>At this point, the White House was consulted directly and the President
                        decided personally to persuade the Irish to sponsor the compromise
                        resolution alone.<note n="12" xml:id="d144fn12">According to a telephone

                        successful and a favorable Irish reply has now been received. Meanwhile, the
                        Department instructed our Mission in New York to seek a 24-hour postponement
                        of Security Council consideration of the Kashmir debate. Accordingly, at the
                        afternoon meeting of the Council on June 21, against Soviet and Indian
                        objections, the United States proposed and the Council approved by a 7-2-2
                        vote that the meeting be postponed until 3 p.m. on June 22. We expect the
                        Irish to put forward the compromise Kashmir resolution at that time.</p>
                    <p>As you can see from the above, we have operated on two basic assumptions: (a)
                        that it would be strongly preferable to have other Security Council members
                        sponsor the resolution; and (b) that if this did not prove feasible, the
                        commitment to Pakistan required us to sponsor a reasonable resolution.</p>

                    <p>On June 22, 1962, the U.N. Security Council met to conclude the debate on
                        Kashmir which grew out of the initial request by Pakistan on January 11 for
                        a meeting of the Council to consider the issue. (See <ref target="#d89"
                            >Document 89</ref>.) <persName>Frederick H. Boland</persName>, Ireland's
                        Representative to the Council, submitted a draft resolution that made
                        reference to earlier resolutions adopted by the Council concerning Kashmir
                        and, in light of those resolutions, urged India and Pakistan to enter into
                        direct negotiations to seek a settlement to the dispute. (U.N. Document
                        S/5134) After a lengthy debate, in which the Indian and Pakistani
                        Representatives repeated well-established positions, the Council voted in
                        favor of the resolution by a vote of 7-2, with 2 abstentions. (U.N. Document
                        S/PV.1016) The United States voted in favor of the resolution, which was
                        vetoed by the negative vote cast by the Representative of the Soviet
                        Union.</p>

                        to the Security Council vote in a statement made on June 23 during a foreign
                        policy debate in the Indian Parliament. <persName>Nehru</persName> expressed
                        “deep regret and sorrow” that the United States and the United Kingdom
                        should “almost invariably be against us” on subjects like Goa and Kashmir.
                        He stated that the Kashmir debate had “hurt and injured” India, and had
                        created “doubt in our minds about the goodwill” of the United States and the
                        United Kingdom toward India. (Telegram 4165 from New Delhi, June 24;

                    <p>I had begun drafting response for what I considered a predictable
                        Presidential inquiry prior to receipt. <persName>Nehru</persName> was in
                        extremely self-righteous mood reflecting a larger attitude here and since he
                        gives the tone to the press and politicians we will no doubt have more of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Obviously it was a nasty accident that our representations on the <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s coincided with the Kashmir ballot in New
                        York. Both are highly emotional issues here. <persName>Nehru</persName> had
                        been hit very hard on the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s by <persName

                        came this debate.</p>
                    <p>His flare-up is related to at least three matters where I judge our position
                        to be sound and one matter where we might wisely reflect on the wisdom of
                        our course. I begin with the matters which the Indians find distasteful but
                        where the medicine is good.</p>

                        <item>The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in general and
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> in particular clearly dislike suggestions
                            that they should tailor their behavior more carefully to American
                            political and public reactions. This is new idea. Until past year we
                            have been so wary of seeming to attach strings that there has been
                            literally almost no mention to Prime Minister of the effect of Indian
                            actions on aid prospect. Avoidance has become the standard of good
                            manners. <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0319"/>Mention of the effect
                            of their actions on aid is by our own standard improper and indecent.
                            This has always seemed to me an intolerable situation. I have made it
                            clear that American public opinion is a highly relevant consideration.
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>'s reference to indirect pressures is his
                            protest against these reminders which he says are an impairment of
                            “India's independence.” Obviously no country is that independent.</item>

                        <item>He is annoyed over my labeling of Soviet rupee sales as aid. On this
                            too they have had it ever so good. For if Soviet rupee sales are not aid
                            then dollars and hard currencies can be reserved for economic assistance
                            and the Soviets can be used for military hardware. The uneasiness when I
                            have attacked on this point has been visible.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There is the conviction in India as elsewhere that we are so
                            pathologically afraid of Communism that to take our aid and remain
                            non-Communist is a great favor. We have affirmed this by a tendency to a
                            supplicant role in which we take ever so seriously India's problems and
                            never mention our own. This relationship is unhealthy as well as
                            undignified. Yet it conditions Indian attitudes and causes surprising
                            reactions when we depart from our erstwhile meekness.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>On the other hand, the Indians have legitimate grounds for objection to the
                        two symbolic battles we have waged on behalf of our allies and against them
                        in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this past year. Both of these
                        allies, so far as one can tell, have considered their relationship with us
                        largely important for advancing their private quarrels in the non-Communist
                        world. (Here helping with our anti-Communism is also considered a real nice
                        favor.) And we have allowed ourselves to become involved unusefully in these
                        far from exemplary quarrels. The rewards, while perhaps greater than from
                        our alliance with General Phoumi, give grounds for reflection, to wit as
                        follows: <list>

                            <item>We supported Portugal in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on
                                Goa. We succeeded in antagonizing India. We did not “save” Goa. We
                                seem to have partially alienated the Portuguese. We got the Russians
                                a very good press. This would seem a low score.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item><p>We supported Pakistan in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    on Kashmir (I am aware of super-innocuity and Irish screen). We
                                    recognize, as do even intelligent Pakistanis, the <gloss

                                    plebiscite are out of date and bear in no practical way on a
                                    settlement. We got nothing practical for Pakistan. We got a bad
                                    press in India. Again the Soviets got a magnificent one. We left
                                    the Pakistanis still complaining about Americans, still
                                    wondering if <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName>
                                    is too pro-American, still negotiating with the Chinese. This
                                    also no high score.</p>
                                <p>In light of our specific commitments, we had no alternative in
                                    this latter case. But clearly we must soon have some concern for
                                    the parochial and messy issues in which our lesser allies
                                    involve us and the consequences. As soon as military needs can
                                    be made to allow we must <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0320"

                                    dignity and some majesty above these disputes. We must recognize
                                    that outside of Europe alignment and non-alignment are mostly
                                    differing techniques for extracting concessions from the US. We
                                    must not be supplicants of the non-aligned or subordinates of
                                    allies. Both positions are weak and unworthy. In these precincts
                                    when one hears talk of being faithful to our allies we should
                                    ask if it means being unfaithful to ourselves.</p>
                                <p>As to the immediate future, I doubt that there is anything very
                                    dramatic we should do. I will downplay aid announcements. I
                                    would hope that having warned of what Congress might do as the
                                    result of the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal it won't
                                    do it anyway. In a calmer time I will go over all these things
                                    again with <persName>Nehru</persName> but I would not think it
                                    wise to hit him again right away.</p></item>

                            <item>Presumably there will be a Pakistan reaction. That, it will be
                                agreed, is partly because they would prefer to have issue continued
                                ad infinitum, ad nauseum even with no affirmative gain if it
                                provides the negative return of worsened US-Indian relations. This
                                we cannot countenance. Statement here will center at least part of
                                reaction on me rather than President or Secretary State. It will
                                also give measure of freedom from the language—it was <persName

                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>'s message to
                        President of July 3:</p>
                    <p>“I have now had a further discussion with my colleagues about this very
                        complicated problem. As I mentioned in my message of June 29 there is quite
                        a chance that the Indians will quietly drop the whole idea of buying
                        fighters; <persName>Nehru</persName>'s recent public statements seem further
                        to support this view. All the same, I think we should both keep up the
                        pressure and leave the Indians in no doubt about the serious effects which
                        their purchase of Russian fighters would have on public opinion in Western
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, it is possible, and indeed perhaps probable, that the Indians
                        will ask us what we have to offer. So we must be ready to meet this
                        event.</p>
                    <p>There are two problems—the physical and the financial. So far as the physical
                        question is concerned, we are ready, in spite of all the difficulties, to
                        make one squadron of Lightnings available and postpone deliveries to our own
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Then there is the probable reaction from Pakistan. You mention your natural
                        anxiety about your facilities there. But, as you know, we also have
                        important facilities of a similar nature in Pakistan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> explained the whole position frankly
                        to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, who was very understanding
                        and recognized the seriousness of allowing the Russians to infiltrate into
                        India's defense system. However, whilst the Pakistan Government may
                        understand the problem and acquiesce in our action, there will doubtless be
                        biased criticism in the Pakistan press and Parliament. I am sure you would
                        not wish us to bear this entirely on our own. I suggest, therefore, that any
                        Western offer of fighters to India should be openly seen to be a joint move
                        in which you and we are both associated.</p>
                    <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0325"/>
                    <p>Now for the financial problem. The full cost of the Lightnings including
                        ancillary equipment will run to between 10 and 11 million pounds sterling.
                        As the Indian situation is pretty desperate we shall, in effect, have to
                        make them a credit or a loan or give them some financial help in some other
                        way without much hope of repayment. It looks as though this assistance will
                        have to go further than we have ever been ready to go to help even our
                        allies or members of the Commonwealth to acquire modern armaments. In our
                        present position we really could not put up more than one quarter of this
                        total, which was the proportion which you will remember we agreed on for the
                        Orpheus engine. Do you see your way to meeting the other three quarters
                        either by paying us or by paying the Indians?</p>
                    <p>Apart from finding the money the complications of your system of grants and
                        Congressional votes, combined with the complications of our system of
                        Parliamentary control will make it quite difficult to work out how payment
                        can actually be made. Perhaps it might be a good plan if you could authorize
                        somebody from your Embassy or someone sent from Washington to discuss with
                        our experts how, if at all, the finance could be arranged.</p>
                    <p>The Indian Finance Minister is in London this week and will certainly ask for
                        more aid. For financial reasons this would not in any case be easy. But even
                        on matters where we could help we propose for the moment to be
                        non-committal. We shall avoid any quotable suggestion of a link between
                        fighters and aid; at the same time we shall leave <persName>Desai</persName>
                        in no doubt that the British people are becoming increasingly anxious about
                        India's general attitude towards the West.</p>
                    <p>I should be grateful if you would let me know how you now see this
                        business.”</p>

                    <p>“July 6, 1962</p>
                    <p>Dear Prime Minister: Thank you for your message of July 3, 1962.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d152fn1">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note> I am
                        encouraged by the prospect of agreement on including a squadron of
                        Lightnings in our spoiling offer to the Indians. This should increase the
                        chance, about which we too are hopeful, that India will end up by delaying
                        indefinitely any purchase of supersonic aircraft.</p>
                    <p>We suspect that Air Vice Marshal Dutt's trip to London may be in order to
                        smoke out our position. Therefore I hope you will do what you can to get him
                        interested in the Lightning. Of course, the longer we can draw out the
                        discussions of this matter the better.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to send over a small group of experts to discuss in some
                        detail how we might share the cost. If ultimately necessary and desirable,
                        we will find some way to compensate you for three-fourths of the cost of one
                        squadron of Lightnings and ancillary equipment through our participation in
                        joint <gloss target="#t_RD1">R &amp; D</gloss> projects. We would hope to do
                        so in a way which would minimize any early drain on our gold reserves.
                        Having just taken a number of difficult decisions in a variety of fields to
                        improve our balance of payments situation, I would be loath in this case to
                        move too soon in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>I am also concerned over making any offer of Lightnings to India openly a
                        joint US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> financial responsibility. Lacking
                        as we do any position as “historical supplier” to India, a public offer by
                        us of what in effect would be military assistance to the Indians could have
                        a number of undesirable consequences. The tone of
                        <persName>Nehru</persName>'s recent discussions has been such that it would
                        be most difficult for me to offer him this kind of assistance in competition
                        with the Soviets at this point. As you know, this is a moment in our
                        legislative process at which the very important financial details of the
                        Foreign Aid Bill hang in the balance. The effect on the Congress of my
                        offering military aid to India on top of our already large economic program
                        there might well be very serious. Accordingly, I <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301"
                            facs="0327"/>strongly prefer that any prospective US sharing of the
                        financial responsibility for Lightnings be kept as quiet as possible.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I hope that you can go forward and dangle the prospect of
                        Lightnings before the Indians without revealing any US financial role as
                        yet; meanwhile we will send our team as soon as you feel it appropriate to
                        deal with possible arrangements between us.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        did not raise any of these topics.</p>
                    <p>Remainder this telegram deals with Afghan relations problem which may require
                        immediate action. Other topics will be reported separate messages.</p>
                    <p>We reviewed present status Afghan issue. I stated my belief that Afghan
                        position may become somewhat more flexible than heretofore. It seemed to us
                        that there may soon be some negotiating room on both sides, and we hoped no
                        opportunity would be lost to press for early solution. President gave me
                        summary of Afghan portion of his recent Murree conversations with <persName

                            >Shah</persName> urged him to allow reopening Afghan Consulates and
                        trade agencies under close <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> police
                        surveillance, but <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> responded that
                        he disliked appearance of making prisoners of Afghan representatives.</p>
                    <p>President said he was entirely willing for either Iran or US to attempt good
                        offices and he presumed that we would concert with Iranians. He felt any
                        third party approach to Afghans should be on a very high level and he
                        assumed that if Iran undertook exploratory talks, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> himself would get in touch with
                        King.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> showed in various oblique ways
                        that he is slightly more inclined to try seriously for a settlement than he
                        has been heretofore. I believe <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName>
                        impressed him with growing menace to entire region of increased Soviet
                        penetration of Afghanistan, which is facilitated by Pak-Afghan rupture.
                        Undoubtedly <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> as well as Afghanistan is
                        feeling some cumulative pinch from cessation transit traffic and trade.
                        Finally, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> seemed increasingly
                        impressed with argument I and others have advanced that sweeping and abrupt
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> move against Consulates and trade
                        agencies last September encouraged extreme Afghan reaction and prejudiced
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> case. I believe he now suspects that
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> handling of matter last fall may
                        have been mistaken, notwithstanding legitimacy of <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> grievances.</p>
                    <p>When I told him that I thought some concessions might be elicited from Afghan
                        side if Afghan face could be saved and if some reciprocal concessions could
                        be made on <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> side, he evinced interest. He
                        said he would be willing to consider guarded <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> exploratory conversations with Afghan representatives, but
                        when I endeavored to probe on this he drew back, saying there was at present
                        no place where high level <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> and Afghan
                        representatives could get together and he felt it would be better for first
                        move to be made through Iranians or us. He still insists he must have some
                        sort of assurances of proper conduct of Afghan Consuls in Peshawar and
                        Quetta and decent treatment of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> Consuls
                        in Afghanistan, but he granted that assurances could be private and in form
                        that would not be demeaning to Afghans.</p>
                    <p>I outlined to him suggestion for initial attempt at agreement on partial
                        reestablishment of Consular and trade agency facilities, coupled with a
                        joint statement of the two governments to effect that “they have agreed to
                        work toward early full reestablishment of Consular and trade agency offices,
                        to function in accordance with the usually accepted tenets of international
                        practice.” I pointed out that this formula could be construed in Pakistan as
                        an implied assurance on part of Afghanistan Government as to the propriety
                        of official conduct of its Consular and trade representatives and
                        correctness of its treatment of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> Consular
                        offices. I did not of course go into matter of how Afghans could at same
                        time interpret phrase as an implied admission on part of <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that its <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                            facs="0329"/>abrupt closure of these offices was not in accordance with
                        traditional international usage.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, President still has belief that diplomatic relations should be
                        restored first and that lower level relations should be reestablished
                        afterwards on a step by step basis as relations gradually improve.</p>
                    <p>I pressed on him my conviction that Afghans would feel that they could not
                        agree to this and that effort should be for reestablishment of Consular,
                        trade and transit relations first, or at least simultaneously with
                        restoration diplomatic relations. While President did not commit himself on
                        this, I believe way is open here for <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Shah</persName> to move discreetly into situation in preliminary way in
                        Kabul, and would hope that Holmes could be authorized to give <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> substance of foregoing for his
                        background use.</p>

                            target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions was useful and Soviet
                        position had been exposed through misuse of veto. I said we did not perceive
                        any useful step we could take at this time to contribute to settlement.
                        Perhaps best course would be to stand back for a while and try to gain
                        perspective which might point way to some new initiative. I added that any
                        attempt toward a settlement would have to have Indian as well as Pakistani
                        cooperation. Resort to use or threat of force was unacceptable, as I knew he
                        would agree. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> assented and said
                        he too felt that perhaps a waiting spell was advisable for all interested
                        parties. He did not have any immediate motive in mind.</p>

                    <p>He said that his reports indicated <persName>Nehru</persName> was a very sick
                        man and that his grip on the helm might be relaxing slightly already. He
                        thought decline of <persName>Nehru</persName> might be quite gradual but he
                        felt his days as head of Indian Government were numbered. He did not wish
                        any harm to <persName>Nehru</persName> but he could not help but wonder if
                        eventual successor government might not be more tractable and more inclined
                        work reciprocally toward better Indo-Pak relations.</p>
                    <p>I said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> could not be certain of a more
                        cooperative successor government in India after withdrawal of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. It was entirely possible that following
                        government might be more difficult to deal with. I expressed hope that if
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had bilateral conversations
                        in mind he would move promptly and not wait for disappearance of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> from scene. I expressed view that something
                        constructive might come out of talks and even if talks failed completely at
                        least Paks would have demonstrated willingness to talk and to search for
                        solutions without imposition of any conditions such as 10-day time limit on
                        preliminary talks as was stipulated last autumn. This stipulation had been
                        misinterpreted in some quarters to Pakistan's disadvantage.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he was not opposed in
                        principle to high level private talks with Indians and he would be prepared
                        to have a private exchange with <persName>Nehru</persName> if cause of
                        better Indo-Pak understanding might reasonably be expected to gain thereby.
                        He did not find prospect particularly encouraging or palatable, but he was
                        willing to make any effort which offered fair prospect of progress and he
                        recognized that a seemingly negative position on bilateral talks while
                        Indians maintained a seemingly positive position put Pakistan in an
                        unfavorable light. He simply did not want to enter into an ill-prepared or
                        premature endeavor which was foredoomed to failure, and which would have to
                        be publicized as such, to the detriment of the objective.</p>
                    <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> if he did not think any
                        talks which might ensue should cover whole range of principal Pak-Indo
                        problems and not be confined exclusively to Kashmir, which would have to be
                        predominant subject.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> speculated on jockeying for power
                        in India which might be expected to follow departure of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. He seemed to feel that considerable reliance
                        could be placed on <persName>Desai</persName> to consolidate Right Wing
                        elements and break <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s
                        drive for power. He doubted if <persName>Desai</persName> could win
                        leadership of government but felt he would play influential role. <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was inclined to give considerable credence
                        to reports that <persName>Nehru</persName> wanted to pave way for his
                        daughter Indira Gandhi to succeed him at least nominally. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> doubted she had qualities required to
                        assume and exercise actual powers of head of government, but she might fill
                        a high titular position. He recognized that accession to power by <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> would be an unqualified
                        catastrophe, and that nothing should be done which would tend to improve his
                        prospects.</p>

                    <p>President was strikingly mild and relaxed on subject of supersonic planes for
                        India. I spelled out full rationale of our concern at <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> possibility. He accepted our reasoning
                        substantially in toto. He seemed to feel that matter would probably not come
                        to show-down. He thought Soviet offer might prove to be to some extent a
                        bluff, since Soviets would recognize that full acceptance <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> offer by Indians would isolate India from
                        West and throw heavy burden of economic support and subsidization of India
                        on Soviet Union. He said he was confident Soviets would be unwilling to pick
                        up enormous tab for economic development to India now paid by U.S. and other
                        Western countries. Therefore, he thought Soviet Union in show-down would
                        probably welsh on its offer, having better use for its resources elsewhere.
                        He also noted with interest my remark that <persName>Nehru</persName> seemed
                        disposed to postpone indefinitely a final decision on matter. It was evident
                        from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s moderate view of
                        possibility that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> may feel compelled to
                        offer few Lightning planes to India, that <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> did excellent job when he saw <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> last month. Although <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was naturally not happy at prospect,
                        he seemed resigned to it and understood reasoning back of it. I made clear
                        to him extent to which we had borne in mind Pakistan's views and interests
                        in our consideration of matter and he was grateful for this. Although he
                        knows we are not entirely disassociated from British in this matter, he
                        evinced no disposition to reproach us. He conjectured that Indians might be
                        tempted to accept Soviet offer to establish an assembly plant for Soviet jet
                        engines in India, with a view to installing the engines in British Lightning
                        air frames.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Pakistani High Commissioner to India,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>, saw President just before
                        me and tells me that he pressed President to enter into private bilateral
                        talks with <persName>Nehru</persName>. He feels it is all important for this
                        to be done before <persName>Nehru</persName>'s health fails further. He says
                        President was noncommittal and <persName corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName>
                        expects to see President again in Rawalpindi before returning to Delhi.
                        President apparently went a little farther with me than with <persName
                            corresp="#p_HA1">Hilaly</persName> in indicating his willingness in
                        principle to consider talks. However, he was quite passive in his attitude
                        and obviously is not now inclined to take any strong initiative. My
                        impression is that he has not thought matter through completely and has not
                        formulated any approach to be used in talks. He is unenthusiastic or at
                        least unconvinced as to merits of talks at this stage but recognizes that an
                        expressed unwillingness to engage in talks is not a good stance. Therefore,
                        we should not take any great measure of encouragement from his attitude,
                        although it does offer a slight opening which might be enlarged by dint of
                        some effort if we believe that our influence should now be exerted actively
                        in favor of talks.</p>

                        <item>The Ambassador said his Government welcomed the Secretary's suggestion
                            for continuing and frank discussions between the two governments to
                            identify clearly areas of agreement and disagreement between the United
                            States and Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan did not, however, feel
                            that there were major areas of disagreement, even though the Pakistani
                            press and public opinion at times had been quite critical of American
                            policy. The Secretary suggested further that he and the Ambassador might
                            fruitfully engage in a fairly broad review of matters of common concern
                            and that the Embassy and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                                >Talbot</persName> might work out an informal agenda. The Ambassador

                        <item><p>With reference to the Secretary's idea that broadened contacts at
                                all levels between Pakistan and India would demonstrate Pakistan's
                                good intentions and help Indo-Pak relations, the Ambassador said
                                that his Government, considering India's present aggressive mood and
                                the Kashmir position, doubted it could do anything now to ease
                                tensions between the two countries. Rather, it feared that anything
                                it might do or say could well produce the opposite result. It had
                                concluded, therefore, for the time being it was better to say
                                nothing, although unfortunately it was hard to prevent the Central
                                and Provincial Assemblies from breaking silence, especially in the
                                aftermath of communal riots. The current tensions were regrettable,
                                the more so because something might have been done to improve
                                over-all relations about two and a half years ago, <pb n="307"
                                    xml:id="pg_307" facs="0333"/>when the mood was better. The
                                Pakistan Government would have liked to be able to find some hopeful
                                prospect of opening up discourses with moderate leaders in India at
                                this time when the transition of power seemed imminent, especially
                                as it felt tragedy would ensue if <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                    >Krishna Menon</persName> should gain strength enough to succeed
                                Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary expressed his appreciation of the thought the Pakistan
                                Government had given to this question, adding that there might come
                                a moment, perhaps at very short notice, when effective contact
                                across the border would be important. He recalled that six or seven
                                years ago at a time of trans-Atlantic frictions Prince Bernhard
                                started a valuable program of bringing official and non-official
                                Europeans and Americans together for private and frank talks about
                                trans-Atlantic relations. Would there be anything like this on the
                                Indo-Pak scene that would be worth encouraging to stimulate contacts
                                on a private basis? For example, could the Pakistan Institute of
                                International Affairs make contact with the Indian Council of World
                                Affairs, both being bodies comparable to Chatham House? The
                                Ambassador agreed to consider this question further with Mr.

                                suggested that it might be helpful if the American Ambassador in New
                                Delhi could keep in touch with the Pakistan High Commissioner there
                                to consider such possibilities.</p></item>

                        <item>On the Secretary's third point—that Pakistan might consider making a
                            formal unilateral declaration abjuring the use of force in disputes with
                            India—the Ambassador affirmed his understanding that this was related to
                            Pakistan's aide-memoir of May 28. He assumed that the Secretary had
                            meant that if the United States should, as requested in that aide
                            memoire, agree that it would come to Pakistan's aid should Pakistan be
                            attacked by India, then India would ask the United States what
                            assurances could be given that Pakistan would not launch an attack
                            against India. The Secretary agreed. The Ambassador said his Government
                            feared that if it were to make the suggested statement, India would ask
                            it to sign a “no war” declaration. That would return the two countries
                            to a controversy that had continued for two and a half years over a
                            question of what alternative machinery could be set up, if war were
                            ruled out, for the settlement of disputes existing between them. There
                            had been talk of tribunals but at that time Mr.
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> had not agreed to the inclusion of an
                            independent member of any tribunal, nor had he any other proposal as to
                            how to proceed if the Indian and Pakistani members of tribunals should
                            fail to agree on any issue. Doubting that Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>
                            had changed his views, the Pakistan Government believed that nothing
                            would be gained by reopening the controversy. Also, Pakistan understood
                            that the Indians believed they already had full assurance that the
                            United States would come to India's aid in the event of a Pakistani
                            attack. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> had made this
                            statement in a speech in Delhi last August. The Secretary observed that
                            we had better look at the text of the speech. What bothered <pb n="308"
                                xml:id="pg_308" facs="0334"/>him, the Ambassador, however, about our
                            giving assurances to India against a Pakistani attack, along with
                            assurances to Pakistan against an Indian attack, was that it hardly
                            fitted the spirit of the alliance between the United States and Pakistan
                            to assure a non-allied country against aggression by one of the partners
                            in the alliance.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that Indian armed forces had doubled in the past five
                        years and that expenses were still rising. Pakistanis wanted to know against
                        whom India was arming itself. Since Goa there had been statements which if
                        not outright threats had been indicative of provocative intentions. The
                        Indians were now saying much that concerned Pakistan; it was not Pakistan
                        that was threatening India.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador added that “they” (presumably his Government) had also said
                        that even if India gave the requested assurances Pakistan would still worry
                        about any military assistance that might be given to India by the West, i.e.
                        by the United States, or by Britain, or by France. Such action would be
                        resented by the Pakistani people, since their Government could not tell them
                        of the secret assurances they had extracted from India. The Pakistani
                        Government also would not rule out the possibility of an Indian attack
                        against Azzad Kashmir. Indeed, the Ambassador feared that it had been the
                        encouragement that India had drawn from Western policies that had freed
                        India to get on with its military buildup. The Indians thought they could
                        get away with anything.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then gave reactions to statements he had heard from Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> about the idea that the
                        British might give the Indians an alternative to the reported Russian offer
                        of supersonic aircraft to India. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1"
                            >McGhee</persName> had made four points, as the Ambassador had
                        understood him. These were: (1) that acquisition of <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>s would open up unlimited opportunities for Soviet
                        involvement in the Indian military establishment; (2) that this would
                        strengthen <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s position;
                        (3) that it would jeopardize the security of British military equipment in
                        use by the Indian armed forces; and (4) that the reaction in this country
                        would be very bad if India concluded a <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        deal. The Ambassador felt, however, that actually it would be good if
                        India's actions should bring an adverse reaction in this country, because
                        only in that way would India learn. At the moment India's foreign reserves
                        were in an extremely parlous state. How could it be talking about getting
                        supersonics? None of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s
                        designs could succeed unless India continued to get aid from the United
                        States. The <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal would doom him because
                        the Congress Party, which was led and financed by a largely conservative
                        group, would be unhappy with the resulting impact on American aid. As for
                        the question of British military security would not the Russians be taking a
                        comparable risk? Why were they not afraid of such a result? In fact, to the
                        Ambassador these arguments looked wide of the mark. He thought the real
                        explanation of British interests might be found in the <pb n="309"
                            xml:id="pg_309" facs="0335"/>comments of two British newspapermen who
                        had told him that “for us this is purely a commercial deal; that is
                        all.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary interjected that that statement had not a shred of reality.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, the Ambassador said that the Indians had always maintained a
                        military disparity of about three to one (the United States, he said, had
                        called it two and a half to one but there was not much difference between
                        the two estimates) over the Pakistani armed forces but in aircraft the
                        disparity was seven to one. The Indians had been informed in 1960 about
                        Pakistan's coming acquisition of F-104s and they knew Pakistan was getting
                        only 12 of them. Why should this number of aircraft trouble the Indians so
                        much? Why should they be expressing their agitation only now?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that this could be related to matters concerning
                        China and the northern border of India. The Ambassador doubted this. He said
                        the Soviets had told the Pakistan Ambassador in Moscow that the Indians had
                        deliberately planned the northern border excitement to assure aid from the
                        United States.</p>

                        President of July 19:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Friend</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your message of July 6<note n="1" xml:id="d157fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d152">Document 152</ref>.</note> about fighters for the
                        Indians.</p>
                    <p>The Indian team were here last week and carried out an evaluation of the
                        suitability of Lightnings for their purposes. Indications are that <pb
                            n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0337"/>they would be interested in both
                        purchase of Lightning Mark IIs and manufacture under license in India of
                        Lightning Mark IIIs. It looks as if they would not regard the development of
                        the Orpheus 12 engine for use in their own HF 24 aircraft as an alternative
                        to the manufacture of Lightning Mark IIIs. They might in fact wish to have
                        both.</p>
                    <p>We are proposing to play the financial part of the discussions long and not
                        to put any specific proposition at this stage. Meanwhile I am grateful for
                        your helpful undertaking that you would find some way to compensate us for
                        three-quarters of the cost of a squadron of Lightnings. I should add that
                        what the Indians mean by a squadron is sixteen front line aircraft plus four
                        back-up aircraft. I also welcome your offer to send over a small group of
                        experts to discuss the matter in more detail and I hope that this can be
                        arranged as soon as possible. It would be helpful if this group was
                        empowered to discuss other possible ways in which you might compensate us as
                        well as the one you have mentioned, which is through our participation in
                        joint R and D projects.</p>
                    <p>I quite understand the difficulty you would feel at this time, particularly
                        while Congress is still sitting, over making any offer of Lightnings to
                        India openly a joint United States/United Kingdom financial responsibility.
                        There are also difficulties for us in taking the whole public responsibility
                        on ourselves. But I think we can postpone further discussion on this
                        particular issue for the moment.”</p>

                        Minister from President. Advise date, time delivery.</p>
                    <p>“July 24, 1962</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I was glad to receive your letter of July 19th,<note n="1" xml:id="d158fn1"
                            >See <ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> with the latest word
                        about the activities of the Indian team. Frankly, I am becoming increasingly
                            <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0338"/>concerned about the potentially
                        rising financial cost, both to you and to us, if we actually have to make
                        good on our Lightning offer.</p>
                    <p>I am dubious about our ability to go as high as the twenty aircraft mentioned
                        in your letter, particularly if it becomes necessary and desirable for us to
                        pick up three-fourths of the hard currency cost. Up to this point, I had
                        thought our offer would be twelve, plus a trainer or two. We are also
                        anxious to restrict the size of any Indian jet buildup, lest it create
                        irresistible pressures for more F-104s from the Pakistani. Therefore, it
                        might be well for you as well as for us to hint in Delhi that if Indian
                        appetites are too large, it may only lead to a further arms race. I would
                        favor offering India only twelve first, and would consider going higher only
                        after further thought.</p>
                    <p>I agree that at this stage the best thing is for our experts to get together
                        to firm up the likely cost of a package and possible ways and means of
                        sharing it. I assume that the Orpheus 12 offer is now a nonstarter, which
                        will give us a bit more leeway. We will send a team over promptly to discuss
                        all aspects of the problem.</p>
                    <p>In the light of our mutual problems, we will also want to reach a clear
                        understanding beforehand on how any offer is to be presented publicly. Even
                        after the Congress adjourns, I would still see major risks of adverse
                        repercussions from open US association with it. Moreover, our current
                        impression is that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> would accept
                        with good grace <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> sale of Lightnings to
                        India, provided that there were not too many. We will take this aspect up
                        further with Ormsby Gore.</p>

                                1964. The Indian team was declined access to the Mark III: <persName

                                whether another effort with the Prime Minister would be

                    <p>Without recounting details there is one more gambit which has been on our
                        minds here, which I have tried soundings and which might conceivably work.
                        Pakistan is still the political nub of this problem. Were I to propose that
                        Indians forego the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s if we assure of
                        standstill on similar weapons to Pakistanis, they might buy. I am not
                        optimistic but it would strike me as a very good bargain (and much cheaper
                        than Lightnings) if we could bring it off and even the discussion might have
                        a long delaying effect. I gather we are not scheduled to give Pakistanis any
                        further fighter aircraft for another 4 or 5 years so even supporters of
                        Pakistan armed power are giving up nothing of importance. It would give me a
                        handle to explain facts of air power on China frontier to Prime Minister.
                        Perhaps this discussion might lead on to stabilization on tanks which our
                        military people here think will cause more trouble here when known than
                        104's, God forbid. Also time is running out on past argument that arms aid
                        to Pakistanis was inherited policy. <persName>Nehru</persName> is leaving
                        town today and will not be back until Monday. I think I had better have
                        another try at him then. While noting doubtless well-grounded Washington
                        aversion to initiatives in this quarter do bear in mind I must have
                        something to talk about. There should, I am sure, be no formal withdrawal of
                        Lightning offer since this would strengthen his position. But unless Indians
                        revive, my judgment would be to let it rest.</p>

                        likely, we want to be in position to observe its consequences in detached
                        fashion, avoiding any implication that, as Ambassador <persName

                        decision by US pressure. Such a stance will be essential to quiet and
                        restrained work which will be needed to rebuild US-Indian relations.</p>

                        provide any more F-104's to Pakistan and that therefore present equilibrium
                        is both most economical and best. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—As of
                        this time such statement can be made. Our internal planning for Pakistan
                        calls for replacement of one obsolescent F-86 squadron in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 but type of replacement aircraft has not
                        been determined. We are thinking in terms of F-5A's but Pakistanis have not
                        been told of this. They undoubtedly assume they will receive modern aircraft
                        within general program of modernizing Pakistan armed forces as F-86's become
                        obsolescent. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>If you think wise, you could further point out to <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        that if Indians acquire or build several squadrons of <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's, it will create great pressure on us
                        from Paks to provide similar aircraft. We want to avoid another arms race of
                        type which Indians themselves have argued we created by our aid to Pakistan.
                        Therefore, even if Indians determined to go ahead with <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal, we hope they will carefully consider
                        how many they buy or build. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>—Best
                        solution at this point might be if Indians bought a few MIG's but did not
                        build. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We also agree it would be useful for you to explain to Prime Minister facts
                        of air power on Sino-Indian frontier. Such a discussion might give you an
                        opportunity to emphasize again to him rapidity with which supersonic planes
                        become obsolescent. By time <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> assembly

                    <p>We agree with your judgment that there should be no formal withdrawal of

                    <p>The sixth meeting of the India consortium, organized by the International
                        Bank for Reconstruction and Development, took place in Washington on July
                        30, 1962. The consortium resumed the discussions which had adjourned without
                        conclusion in May. The meeting was attended by the members that had
                        participated in the meeting on June 2, 1961 (see <ref target="#d24">Document
                            24</ref>), plus Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands. The
                        representatives of Austria and the Netherlands attended as observers.
                        Belgium and Italy joined the consortium, raising the number of member
                        countries to ten.</p>
                    <p>According to the press release issued at the close of the meeting, the
                        consortium considered India's requirements for fiscal year 1962/1963, <pb
                            n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0343"/>the second year of its current
                        5-year plan for economic development. Preliminary commitments for the year
                        had been made at the June 1961 meeting. Because of the addition of Belgium
                        and Italy as contributing members, the total committed by the consortium for
                        1962/1963 increased to $1.07 billion from the $955 million anticipated in
                        1961. The U.S. commitment for the year was $435 million. The United States
                        had indicated at the 1961 meeting that it intended to contribute $500
                        million for 1962-1963, but Congressional requirements mandated that the U.S.
                        contribution be proportionate to the contributions of the other members. The
                        U.S. representative indicated that the United States was prepared to match
                        further commitments of other members of the consortium up to a total U.S.
                        contribution of $500 million. (Telegram 340 to New Delhi, July 30;

                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> of Iran undertook on his own
                        initiative to mediate the Afghan-Pakistan transit dispute. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> consulted in Rawalpindi, Kabul,
                        Rawalpindi and Kabul in that order. He returned to Tehran on August 1 after
                        spending about two weeks in the area. His mission was not immediately
                        successful. The Afghan position continued to be that the reopening of Afghan
                        trade agencies and consulates was a prerequisite to the resumption of normal
                        relations. Pakistan's position, as subsequently confirmed to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> by <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, similarly showed no give. In fact,
                        the account given to our Ambassador to Pakistan takes an even harder
                        position than Iranian sources have reported. The Government of Pakistan at
                        present shows no inclination to restore <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318"
                            facs="0344"/>Afghan trade or consular offices in the frontier region in
                        spite of previous indications that they might be willing to make some
                        accommodation. The Government of Pakistan, however, reiterated its
                        willingness to facilitate Afghan transit trade through Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName>'s efforts, however, appear to
                        have obtained the consent of the disputants to further talks in Tehran under
                        his aegis. The present unyielding attitudes of the disputants, however, does
                        not augur well for the outcome of the talks. The <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Shah</persName>'s activity seems to have contributed little to a
                        solution but the Afghans appeared appreciative of his efforts and therefore
                        Iranian-Afghan relations probably benefited. The United States position has
                        been to remain in the background during the <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Shah</persName>'s mission but to be prepared to assist if appropriate.
                        We believe for the present we should continue this policy but we shall keep
                        it under close review.</p>

                            wrote to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> thanking him for
                            all the sympathy and friendship he had shown to India, more particularly
                            in regard to aid for development. The United States had not only given
                            India generous assistance but had taken the trouble to induce other
                            countries also to do so. However, it was the friendly and sympathetic
                            attitude, even more than the aid, for which India was grateful. ‘My
                            colleagues here and I are particularly anxious to have the friendship of
                            the United States in the great tasks that confront us. I believe that
                            this friendship is good not only for our two countries, but also for the
                            world.' <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0345"/>This had little to do

                            for the United States to help India in her development, the Indian
                            Government would still value the friendship of the United States and
                            work for close relations between the two countries. Differences of
                            viewpoint should not affect this friendship. ‘I can assure you,
                            therefore, that whatever might happen, our attitude will continue to be
                            to encourage friendly relations between our two

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I learn in the newspapers of
                        your long summer evenings in the White House and it occurs to me that I
                        should help you out with some good reading.</p>
                    <p>Politically things remain in a repulsive state. <persName>Nehru</persName> is
                        still in indifferent health although he has picked up strength during the
                        last few weeks while parliament has been in recess. (It assembles again
                        today.) For years the reins have been nearly all in his hands. Now he
                        neither drives nor relinquishes. The other ministers, with the exception of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>—and to some extent
                            <persName>Desai</persName>—are so completely accustomed to passivity
                        that they cannot change.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> continues his drive and, I am
                        sure, has considerable plans for an autumn campaign in New York and perhaps
                        elsewhere. He got a large boost out of the Kashmir debate and has certainly
                        considered ways and means of getting another lift including the possibility
                        of some shooting along the Pakistan border. This would also have the merit
                        of taking attention away from China where his sympathies and
                        fellow-travelling instincts make him vulnerable. (He is also I think
                        worrying considerably lest the China border flareup give the Soviets second
                        thoughts on <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s with the slap at China
                        thus implied.) The snow closes off any danger from the Chinese around the
                        middle of November. Until then last year the Chinese had been dominating the
                        headlines; <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> completely cured
                        that by going into Goa. I would be surprised if the notion of a <pb n="320"
                            xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>repeat performance has entirely escaped
                        him. However there are also more risks this time.</p>
                    <p>I continue to feel fairly clear on the policy we should follow which involves
                        a careful triangulation between <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName> and his supporters, his opposition here and your
                        opposition in Washington. We must do everything possible to avoid building
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> up as we have in the past.
                        This includes, to replay a record, denying him the highly emotional issues
                        at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and concerning Pakistan that we have
                        given him in the past and making it clear that we consider him a kind of
                        antique radical whose tactic of alienating everyone in sight is a diplomatic
                        novelty that does more harm to India than anyone else. In a curious way he
                        is the Hindu Dulles—alienating people as he goes. (Give the phrase Hindu
                        Dulles to someone.)</p>
                    <p>For <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s opponents our basic
                        policy is the aid program. It makes them the responsible people who hold the
                        country together.</p>
                    <p>I am also persuaded that it would have a good effect here and a good ultimate
                        effect in Washington if we were to be cooler in our general technical,
                        economic and cultural assistance to India than in the past and I have been
                        moving along this line. In past years we have sometimes been so eager to
                        help and so anxious to explain ourselves that the Indians have forgotten
                        both how to ask or be grateful and they have come to conclude that it is the
                        business of the world to understand them. Even our friends do not get credit
                        for help that is too eagerly offered—and which the opposition hastens to say
                        the Americans will provide anyway.</p>
                    <p>I have been making it clear that I think Indian reaction to our problems in
                        getting them aid is exceedingly curious. I am taking up the subject in
                        suitably broad, bland terms in a speech to Indian M.P.'s this week.</p>
                    <p>Some of this bears on my own role here. Our original conception of Indian
                        policy now going on two years ago was that by aid and the right kind of
                        representation we could get considerable help from the Indians. We haven't
                        got much and I doubt that my high-minded salesmanship of the New Frontier
                        has been at fault. I am enormously admired up to the very moment when I make
                        a request. I will go into my future, a topic which crosses even my totally
                        selfless mind, sometime in the future.</p>
                    <p>As you will have seen, I have put the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        discussion on ice. I think it served a useful purpose. We raised the
                        threshold against buying Soviet equipment and we let our friends in the
                        Armed Services here know there was an alternative. However I must say that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>, with his control of all
                        channels of technical knowledge, shot down the Lightning with appalling
                        ease. In the end I began to develop a few reservations, which I gather you
                        shared, about the cost (in overseas dollars) of this package.</p>
                    <p>I am still far from certain that the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal
                        is going to come off. I have been spreading the idea that they are useless
                        toys with some success, and I continue to think that the Soviets will be
                        reluctant to arouse <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0347"/>Chinese
                        passions at a time when they are pressing the Chinese and Indians to stop
                        playing war with their elbows on the northern border.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of issues unrelated to India.]</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> has reported a
                        conversation he had with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName> on August 6, during which Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> indicated the Indians “expect to have
                        negotiations with the Chinese.” The talks would be after the Commonwealth
                        Prime Ministers' meeting in September and would probably be conducted on the
                        Indian side by Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J.
                            Desai</persName>. <persName>Nehru</persName> expressed some worry about
                        the number of men up in the mountains “who wonder who is going to shoot
                        first.” Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> apparently does not expect much in
                        the way of concrete results from the talks, but thinks they will calm the
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> was explaining to
                        the Ambassador a statement he had made earlier in the day to the opening
                        meeting of the current session of the Indian Parliament. According to the
                        press, Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> told the Parliament that the Indian
                        Government on July 26 had sent a note to Peiping which pointed out the
                        necessity of avoiding incidents and proposed, when current tensions have
                        eased, to resume discussions on the basis of the report on the previous
                        talks held in 1960. Peiping's reply had been received by the Indian
                        Government the day before, August 5. Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> read
                        excerpts to the Parliament. The excerpts apparently gave <pb n="322"
                            xml:id="pg_322" facs="0348"/>Peiping's approval of the Indian suggestion
                        for further discussion on the boundary question but repeated Peiping's
                        previous charges of Indian advances into Chinese territory. Peiping
                        indicated that there “need not be any preconditions for Sino-Indian
                        discussions.” Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> characterized the note as
                        rather disappointing but said that the Indian Government was examining the
                        note and hoped to send a reply at an early date.</p>
                    <p>The full text of neither note is yet available so that assessment of the
                        probability of meaningful Sino-Indian negotiations on the border in the near
                        future must be very tentative.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has always maintained that it desires
                        to settle the dispute by negotiation; but it has always made plain that it
                        will only negotiate if Peiping is willing to admit there is substantial
                        validity to the Indian position on the border question. The most fundamental
                        aspect of the Indian position is the principle that the border is
                        well-defined by geography, tradition and treaty and that the only matter
                        subject to negotiation is the determination of how the principle applies to
                        certain minor areas in dispute where surveys have not been undertaken.
                        Peiping, however, claims that the entire border is undefined and that the
                        Indian Government should negotiate from a tabula rasa, as it were.</p>
                    <p>When the Chinese note suggests “there need not be any preconditions” for
                        Sino-Indian discussions, Peiping seems to be repudiating India's fundamental
                        position and insisting on its own point of view as the point of departure,
                        just as in the past. The China border question is such an emotionally
                        charged question of national prestige among such a wide segment of literate
                        Indian opinion that it would be extraordinarily difficult for Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to enter into actual negotiation with the
                        Chinese on the terms Peiping now proposes. However, conversations about the
                        border, short of actual negotiations, could undoubtedly be justified to
                        Indian public opinion as they were in 1960.</p>
                    <p>We have had repeated indications [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] during the last month that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been suggesting to the Indians the
                        possibility of a friendly settlement of the border issue. The Soviets have
                        made what appear to be offers of mediation for this purpose; Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> has reportedly turned down these offers. We
                        have also received reports of renewed suggestions from Peiping to the
                        Government of Burma for it to try to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> to hold talks with Red China, possibly in Rangoon.</p>
                    <p>It should also be noted that the military activities in Ladakh of the past
                        three months appear now to have reached a stalemate. Indian and Chinese
                        outposts are sufficiently close to each other that their mutual presence
                        inhibits significant further advances on the ground by either side along the
                        nearly 200-mile frontier from the Karakorum Pass to the Spanggur Lake. There
                        are no indications that either side wishes to start up full-scale fighting
                        at present.</p>
                    <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0349"/>
                    <p>Therefore, it is understandable that India and Red China should wish to shift
                        from the game of military maneuvering on the ground to the pursuit of their
                        objectives by diplomatic means. It is entirely possible that the diplomatic
                        maneuvering may lead to further official conversations between the two
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>But we remain of the belief that a greater willingness to compromise will
                        have to be exhibited by Peiping before actual negotiations leading to a
                        settlement can take place.</p>

                    <p>Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> met
                        September 11 for approximately one hour. Following brief exchange on Cuban
                        and Berlin situations and Zafrulla's candidacy, Secretary asked whether
                        Ambassador had received any indication of specific subjects President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> wished to cover in his talk
                        with President. Ambassador replied that only specific subject mentioned so
                        far was <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> requirements, but he assumed
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> wished, among other matters,

                            >MIG</gloss>s and Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then stated that perhaps best place begin in discussing US-Pak
                        relations was US attitude toward allies vs. neutrals.</p>

                    <p>He developed at some length our view of value of alliances to participating
                        countries. Among points made by Secretary were that: <list>

                            <item>Since alliances formed for specific and agreed reasons, success of

                            <item>US did not view alliances as meaning members had to agree on all
                                subjects, particularly those unrelated to basic agreed purposes of
                                alliance.</item>

                    <p><persName>Ahmed</persName> commented at length that people of Pakistan
                        believed distinction in treatment of allies and neutrals had become blurred;
                        they demand with increasing insistency to know what special value accrues to
                        Pakistan as an ally. To them it appears that, in fact, India receives same
                        essential benefits without costs and risks of being an ally. He then noted
                        that crux of issue for Pakistan is whether ally supports Pakistan on Kashmir
                        issue. He dwelt at some length on familiar Pakistan views on Kashmir. He
                        repeatedly stated that a Kashmir solution was key to future stability on the
                        subcontinent.</p>
                    <p>Secretary replied that in his view Pakistan received considerable benefits
                        from alliances and without them would be in isolated and uncomfortable
                        position. In addition, could critics of alliances convincingly show that
                        Pakistan's relations with neighbors would be better if Pakistan were not in
                        alliance? Referring to Kashmir the Secretary remarked that US was caught in
                        middle of problem in which we had no hand in creating. We approached
                        subcontinent as a whole and we saw in Kashmir a problem which was diverting
                        energies and resources of both nations from key problems of development.
                        Pakistan is aware that we have also lost considerably in India because of
                        our support to Pakistan. Pakistan, as well as other countries, should
                        realize that in such matters US leverage and powers of persuasion are
                        limited.</p>
                    <p>Time scheduled for appointment ended before Secretary could go further into
                        our views Kashmir and other Indo-Pakistan-US problems, and it was agreed he
                        would meet again with <persName>Ahmed</persName> before President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> arrived.</p>

                            >MIG</gloss>'S</p>
                    <p>Indian interest in acquiring a supersonic aircraft capability has not abated.
                        This capability appears to include a certain number of supersonic planes,
                        the rights for the manufacture or assembly of jet fighters of foreign design
                        in India, and the manufacture of the Indian-designed fighter HF-24 and a
                        foreign engine for it in India. India has already announced plans for
                        securing one item in this package. It has signed an agreement with the
                        Soviet Union for the manufacture in India of a Soviet jet engine for use on
                        the Indian-designed HF-24.</p>
                    <p>Agreement on manufacture of an engine for the HF-24 has been accompanied by
                        continued attempts by India to reach agreement with the Soviet Union to
                        secure additional items in India's desired supersonic packages. It seems
                        probable that the Indians will reach agreement with the Soviet Union on the
                        purchase of some <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21 fighters before the
                        end of the year. However, it seems less likely that there will be an
                        agreement in the foreseeable future providing for the manufacture of <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s in India.</p>
                    <p>At the end of August all members of the Indian evaluation team which had gone
                        to Moscow to inquire into the purchase and manufacture in India of <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s had returned to New Delhi. We understand
                        that the leader of the team has reported favorably on the aircraft; some
                        members, however, consider the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21 to
                        have certain serious drawbacks. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> has reported that <persName>Nehru</persName> has
                        become increasingly cool to the expenditures necessary for a <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal and his disposition is to postpone it
                        or scale it down. When asked about the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>
                        deal by reporters in London on September 9, <persName>Nehru</persName> said,
                        however, that “negotiations have gone a good bit further.” He added that
                        India looked upon the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal “as a normal
                        commercial transaction without any political implications.” He said India
                        could get better terms from the U.S.S.R. because of the nature of the Soviet
                        economy. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, whose
                        political prestige is intimately involved in the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss> issue, has been steadily pressing for approval.</p>
                    <p>Because of the absence from India of key <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        ministers, India may not announce a decision on a <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss> deal until after <persName>Nehru</persName> returns to
                        India, if then. (<persName>Nehru</persName> will make brief visits to
                        France, Ghana and Nigeria prior to his return to India on October 1.)</p>
                    <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0352"/>
                    <p>There are several reasons why an agreement to manufacture <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>'s in India seems less likely to eventuate
                        than an arrangement for purchase. On the Indian side, critics of a <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> manufacturing agreement argue that <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21's manufactured in India would be
                        obsolete by the time they became operational, estimated at two to three
                        years from the time an agreement is concluded.</p>
                    <p>On the Soviet side, there have been indications that the Soviets have been
                        experiencing doubts, for both technical and political reasons, about
                        providing India with a manufacturing capability for the <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-21. The Soviets apparently have had some
                        question about Indian ability to handle so complicated a program as
                        manufacturing supersonic fighters. This seems to us to be reasonable caution
                        on the part of the Soviets. Additionally, we have received reports that the
                        Soviet Union has been meeting strong Communist Chinese objections,
                        particularly to the proposal for manufacturing <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>'s in India.</p>
                    <p>The Indians have repeatedly said that the right to manufacture is an
                        essential element in their determination to acquire a supersonic capability.
                        Soviet reservations regarding manufacture might therefore have an effect on
                        the entire <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal.</p>
                    <p>As expressed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                        in a recent assessment, “It could be that the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss> deal is expiring not with a bang but a whimper.”</p>

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> what he thought the
                        prospects were for some sort of solution of the Afghan problem. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> indicated that he was not
                        optimistic about the outlook for an improvement in relations. He gave a
                        summary of the history and present status of the mediation effort of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName> of Iran, substantially along
                        lines already reported by our Embassies in Tehran, Karachi, and Kabul.
                        Although the chances for a settlement did not seem promising owing to Afghan
                        unwillingness to show any flexibility, he thought that a meeting of the
                        three Foreign Ministers, or other representatives of the three governments,
                        could still be arranged, to take place shortly after they returned from the
                        General Assembly. The meeting would have taken place in Tehran before the
                        General Assembly, if Afghan Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName> had not had to cancel because he wanted to take his son
                        to Europe for medical treatment.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he felt there was
                        little hope for Afghanistan so long as the present Royal Family remained in
                        power. He characterized the Royal Family as being entirely indifferent to
                        the needs and interests of the mass of the Afghan people. He termed the
                        regime as cruel and motivated by expediency. He said the ruling family had
                        formed its opinion that the Soviet Union was going to take over South Asia
                        and was shaping its policy accordingly. He felt that the Afghan Government
                        was influenced by this estimate when it broke relations with Pakistan and
                        terminated trade and transit arrangements with Pakistan. The Afghan rulers
                        had always played one side against another and their assessment of the
                        present situation caused them to lean toward the Soviet Union. He thought
                        they would have given the Soviets an opening, regardless of the policy
                        followed by Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> expressed the deep
                        concern of the U.S. Government at the adverse trend of events in
                        Afghanistan. It was clear that the extension of Soviet influence was
                        proceeding at a rapid rate. It seemed to the U.S. that the break with
                        Pakistan had accelerated the adverse trend. It had made the Afghans far more
                        dependent on Soviet trade than on the trade route through the Soviet Union.
                        It had tended to isolate Afghanistan from the free world countries and had
                        made it extremely difficult and expensive for the Afghans to receive any
                        free world economic assist-ance. We do not feel that Afghanistan is
                        irretrievably lost, but a major effort must be made to save the situation.
                        Restoration of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan seems essential to
                        the success of the effort to counter the expansion of Soviet influence.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName><pb n="328"
                            xml:id="pg_328" facs="0354"/>then outlined, in general terms, our
                        thinking as to how Pakistan-Afghanistan relations might be restored. He
                        indicated the U.S. would be prepared to assist the financing and
                        construction of short rail extensions into Afghanistan from Quetta-Chaman to
                        Spin Baldak and from the Khyber Pass to a connecting point in Afghan
                        territory. With the completion of this rail extension, which would require
                        some months for consruction, it would be possible to send Afghan goods
                        across Pakistani territory to Afghanistan in sealed cars in bond, with no
                        transshipment or handling of the merchandise in Pakistan required. This
                        would mean Afghan Trade Agencies would not be required. Our proposal was
                        that the Pakistan Government allow the stationing of Trade Agencies in
                        Peshawar and Quetta temporarily, such Trade Agencies to be closed as soon as
                        the rail extensions are in operation. Diplomatic relations and trade and
                        transit arrangements under this plan would be re-established immediately,
                        along with the temporary reopening of the Trade Agencies. Consulates at
                        Peshawar and Quetta would not be established now under the proposal, but
                        small consulates would be reopened as soon as the Trade Agencies were
                        closed. Since the number of Afghan representatives would be small, they
                        could be kept under surveillance. The President said that, if desired, we
                        would be willing to assist the Pakistani authorities in satisfying
                        themselves that the Afghan representatives were not engaging in improper
                        activities.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that this formula would achieve the objective of
                        restoring Afghanistan's access to the free world and would improve the
                        prospects of keeping Afghanistan out of the Soviet camp. It would save the
                        face of both Afghanistan and Pakistan and would give Pakistan reasonable
                        protection against objectionable activities of Afghan representatives among
                        the tribesmen.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> indicated that he had
                        considerable reservations to this proposal. He was agreeable to the rail
                        extension, Chaman to Spin Baldak, which was already contemplated, but he
                        seriously doubted the financial and engineering feasibility of a rail
                        extension from the Khyber Pass into Afghanistan. Nor did he think this was
                        necessary. A trucking service from Peshawar over the existing highway was
                        far more economical and practical. This trucking service had always worked
                        well and could continue to do so. The Afghans could pick up the goods in
                        Peshawar and handle the traffic arrangements in any way they pleased. Every
                        facility would be granted by the Pakistani authorities even to the extent of
                        some sacrifice of Pakistani traffic requirements. He thought the cost of
                        extending the line through the very difficult mountainous terrain of the
                        Khyber area would be enormous and long delayed and impossible to justify.
                        The existing short line west of Peshawar was a difficult engineering
                        accomplishment which was very expensive when it was built some <pb n="329"
                            xml:id="pg_329" facs="0355"/>decades ago. Even then the British could
                        justify it only on military grounds.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that if the
                        Afghan ruling authorities were really interested in restoring trade, they
                        would have accepted the U.S. compromise proposal of last March which
                        Pakistan had accepted and which would have enabled the Afghans to supervise
                        and document the transit traffic in Pakistan (although this was not really
                        necessary), by means of Afghan Trade Agents stationed in Karachi, who would
                        have had the right to travel periodically to the border points in connection
                        with the transit traffic. The fact that the Afghans had rejected this, and
                        had terminated the limited sixty-day resumption of transit traffic which
                        continued through February and March of this year and which had worked very
                        satisfactorily, showed that the Afghans did not really put a high priority
                        on resumption of trade and transit.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that he did not
                        see how Pakistan could safely permit the return of Afghan government
                        representatives to the sensitive tribal area. They were all trouble-makers
                        and they had orders to stir up the tribesmen. There has been great
                        improvement in the peace and stability of the tribal area since the
                        departure of the Afghan representatives last year. Before that, there had
                        been numerous bombing and shooting incidents, some of them rather serious.
                        In one clash, 700 had been killed. Furthermore, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that public opinion in
                        Pakistan was a factor which had to be taken into account, especially since
                        the return of constitutional government last June. The public understood the
                        Afghan problem, and would regard President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> and his government as “fools,” if the return of Afghan
                        local representatives was allowed on practically the same basis as before.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> felt there would be no
                        legitimate consular work for Afghan consuls in the Northwest Frontier area
                        anyway. They would only be there for subversive purposes. He was willing to
                        permit the Afghans to have all the consulates they wanted in Rawalpindi and
                        beyond, but no closer to the border than Rawalpindi. It seemed to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that the logical first step
                        would be for the Afghans to agree to the re-establishment of diplomatic
                        relations. After this was accomplished, efforts could be made to restore
                        other relations, step by step.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> pointed out that the
                        Afghan sensibilities had to be considered. The Afghans had been offended by
                        the Pakistan action of last year in closing the Afghan offices. The Afghans
                        would certainly need to give assurance as to proper conduct of their
                        representatives and they could not expect an exact return to the former
                        situation. With only a small Afghan consulate eventually situated in
                        Peshawar and with the various safeguards, it seemed unlikely that the Afghan
                        representatives could create serious difficulties, or threaten Pakistan
                        security. The U.S. had been able to control Communist consuls in New York
                        without any great <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0356"/>difficulty. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> noted that it was
                        customary for a neighboring country to have a consulate in a nearby friendly
                        city as important as Peshawar. There would be some visa work and other
                        traditional work for an Afghan representative to perform in Peshawar.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> urged President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to view the problem from a
                        broad standpoint, bearing in mind the very large stakes involved. He hoped
                        that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could overlook
                        some of the local factors in view of the much wider implications of the
                        problem. It was our view that the prospects for saving Afghanistan from
                        satellite status were greatly reduced by the continuation of the impasse
                        between Pakistan and Afghanistan and that the security of Pakistan itself
                        would be threatened in a major way by the entry of Afghanistan into the
                        Soviet orbit.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he agreed on the
                        great danger to Pakistan inherent in the present situation and outlook. He
                        said he expected to be confronted with Soviet or Soviet-controlled forces on
                        his border with Afghanistan at some time. He felt that Pakistan's policy was
                        not responsible for the mistaken policy of the Afghan rulers. He felt that a
                        change in the government of Afghanistan and some sort of confederation
                        between Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan was the only hopeful way of dealing
                        with the security problem. Under present circumstances, the Soviets were
                        very confident and did not feel it necessary to show their hand openly in
                        Afghanistan. Their technicians and advisors were being very correct and were
                        staying in the background. The Soviets were able to use central Asian
                        nationals to do their work when necessary. These people could hardly be
                        distinguished from the natives of Afghanistan. He thought the Soviets were
                        playing their game very cleverly in Afghanistan and possibly would not have
                        to make a show of aggressive force, which would have a damaging
                        international effect.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then said rather
                        reluctantly that, in view of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName>'s views, he would be willing to consider permitting
                        the establishment of Afghan “tentacles” in the Quetta-Chaman area, and in
                        the Khyber area, but not in Peshawar itself. He might consider allowing an
                        Afghan representative in say Landikotal, between Peshawar and the border,
                        but Peshawar was too sensitive and he could not consider authorizing the
                        reopening of an Afghan government office there. The Afghans still had
                        permission to station representatives of the Afghan banks there, but
                        official representatives could not be permitted in Peshawar.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> noted that there was
                        a basis for discussion in this offer of President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s even though it did not go so far as
                        we had suggested. We thought it was important for representatives of the two
                        countries to get together in the presence of Iranians as soon as possible to
                        try to work out an agreement. He hoped that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could authorize his people to start
                        the discussions.</p>
                    <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0357"/>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that this would be

                        in Tehran, after an initial preliminary meeting in New York while they are

                        described as devious and shifty. He said he preferred to deal with <persName

                            scheduled to meet with Afghan Foreign Minister <persName

                        the first (and perhaps last) real chance we'll have to influence the basic
                        outlook of the Afghan regime.</p>
                    <p>All in town are convinced that Moscow is slowly but surely binding
                        Afghanistan to it in a way the Afghans sooner or later won't be able to
                        escape. The latest is a sensitive report<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">Not
                            found.</note> that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is insisting on
                        a three-year export monopoly on karakul and rugs, major Afghan exports. Our
                        Embassy claims this would signify the “virtual end of <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> economic independence.” Whether or not
                        Kabul is in fact past the point of no return, the trend is certainly
                        clear.</p>
                    <p>Dominant Soviet influence in Afghanistan would so increase the pressures on
                        Iran and Pakistan as to justify a major forestalling effort on our part.
                        Such an effort would involve largely US economic aid. But here we run afoul
                        of the Pushtunistan issue and its derivative, the transit dispute, which
                        prevents us from even getting much aid in.</p>
                    <p>We've just tried moving <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> on this
                        issue without much success. He's probably willing to compromise but won't
                        restore status quo ante as Kabul insists.</p>
                    <p>So we've got to get the Afghans to come halfway too. The only means I see is
                        to drive home to <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> and his brother
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> how dangerous a spot we
                        think <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0358"/>they're in and how little we
                        can do to help so long as our entry through Pakistan is blocked.</p>
                    <p>To me, this requires lifting the discussion above the level of Pushtunistan
                        and transit. There is no purchase in letting <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName> give you his usual long harangue on these; he is letter
                        perfect and passionately convinced he's right.</p>
                    <p>Instead I'd urge stressing our concern over the skillful game Moscow is
                        playing—half a billion in loans and grants, 3-4000 Soviet technicians, and
                        reorientation of most Afghan trade toward the Bloc. The Soviets have been
                        very cautious to date, but <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>
                        should ask himself what they might do once they have Afghans in their
                        grasp.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>'s comeback will surely be to
                        appeal for greater US aid and support. Here I think we should frankly ask
                        him whether he thinks we can desert our ally Pakistan on Pushtun issue, when
                        we fully recognize Durand Line. We can't even continue present aid program
                        effectively till the border is opened anyway.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> shows any give, you could tell
                        him: (1) you personally told <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        that both he and Afghans must recognize that their common security interest
                        far transcends their lesser disputes—Afghanistan must have a friendly
                        Pakistan in its rear and vice versa; (2) we are convinced that straight
                        restoration of the status quo ante is unacceptable to <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, but; (3) he seems willing to
                        compromise and agreed to foreign ministers talks under Iranian auspices in
                        New York; (4) we urge Afghans to pick up this gauge before something sours
                        the prospects again; and (5) there can be a reasonable settlement if both
                        sides will keep their larger mutual interests clearly in mind (pp. 4-5 of
                        State's Talking Paper<note n="3" xml:id="d169fn3">Not printed. (Kennedy
                            Library, National Security Files, Countries Series, Afghanistan,
                            9/14/62-9/26/62)</note> have more details).</p>
                    <p>The Afghans, who are horribly isolated, may just feel that the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is coming out on top, and that they have
                        to bend with the wind. So you may want to weave in a few remarks about the
                        Bloc's current troubles and our confidence we're ahead, though pointing out
                        as a fact of life that we would have a hard time helping Afghans if they got
                        too enmeshed by Soviets before they woke up and called for help.</p>
                    <p>My sense is that you might just be able to break this logjam. As was the case
                        with Sukarno, these proud, sensitive Afghan leaders might take from you what
                        no one else can really get across.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The President opened the conversation with an expression of his concern and
                        interest in strengthening relations with Afghanistan, and of his concern
                        with the problems which were arising out of the relations between
                        Afghanistan and its neighbors, and possible means for their solution.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> responded, in English and
                        in a very low voice dropping on occasion to a whisper, with a little speech
                        in which he expressed his appreciation of the interest of the President in
                        Afghanistan, in aid for development and in the resolution of the border
                        problem. He regretted the lack of results in the latter area, noting that it
                        appeared Pakistan was not desirous of reestablishing normal relations
                        between the two countries. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince
                            Naim</persName> noted the delicate situation in Afghanistan, and that it
                        was a part of the frontier of the Free World, but in contrast to the United
                            <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0361"/>States, a part of the old
                        frontier. Its society was not of the type of its neighbor to the north and,
                        left alone, would not evolve in that direction.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> noted that Afghanistan was
                        in a very exposed location, continually confronted with economic and
                        political isolation. He said that the Pakistan policy of denying the true
                        facts and of pressing for the increased isolation of Afghanistan from the
                        Free World was making Afghanistan more and more dependent, and dangerously
                        so, on its northern neighbor. This constituted a dangerous threat not only
                        to Afghanistan but to the Free World as well.</p>
                    <p>He said there were two principal issues between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The
                        first was the complicated Pushtunistan issue which will take much time and
                        patience to solve. The second was the issue of Afghanistan's access to the
                        sea.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected at this point that he could not understand why the
                        issue of trade through Pakistan to Afghanistan could not be separated from
                        the other issues between the two countries, and why a solution could not be
                        found for this problem standing alone.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> stated that it was more
                        than a problem of just physical movement of goods, that there was a real
                        question as to what kind of trade was possible in the absence of consular
                        and trade offices to take care of the papers and consular activities
                        associated with the movement of goods and people. Without consular
                        facilities it was extremely difficult for traders and other personnel, such
                        as truck drivers, to function. On the other hand, he said, it is possible to
                        separate the border/trade problem from the general Pushtunistan issue and
                        this was what the Afghans proposed. He said that the Pushtunistan political
                        problems raised by the Pakistanis in connection with the consulates were
                        imaginary ones in that the Afghans, given the open border, can pass freely
                        back and forth.</p>
                    <p>The President returned to the theme that it should be possible for
                        Afghanistan, if it really wants to, to reach an agreement with Pakistan
                        allowing trade and aid to flow smoothly through Pakistan, and that it should
                        be possible to solve that problem without having to solve other
                        problems.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> stated that it is a matter
                        of life and death for Afghanistan to maintain its trade and aid ties with
                        the West. Unfortunately Pakistan had mixed the subject of consulates and
                        trade agencies, necessary for trade and aid goods to pass, with the broader
                        political issues. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> said
                        that Afghanistan was most willing to guarantee that its consular offices
                        would not engage in improper political practices and would abide by
                        conservative international practices. If the Pakistanis had some suspicion
                        of a problem they could declare the person involved persona non grata. Also,
                        the building of one or two rail spurs would help since when finished there
                        would no longer be a need for trade agencies in the <pb n="336"
                            xml:id="pg_336" facs="0362"/>frontier area. However, consular facilities
                        will be required for the thousands of Afghans who travel along the two
                        routes from Pakistan into Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>The President then said that he wished to affirm most strongly our friendship
                        for Afghanistan and our desire to be of help. However, he believed that
                        Afghanistan could not long exist in a position of growing dependency on the
                        U.S.S.R., that under the best of circumstances independence of a country
                        cannot be maintained readily by complete dependence on one country. The Iran
                        route was useable to a point but too expensive. In his opinion Afghanistan
                        needed to make adjustments to reach some solution of its problem with
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> replied that the
                        undesirable and growing dependence on the north is a result of moves by the
                        Pakistanis. He noted parenthetically that when Afghanistan came to the
                        United States for military aid in 1952-53 the United States turned down the
                        request even though Afghanistan said it was threatened on both borders. He
                        noted that in education they were still placing their dependency in this
                        field in the West, and on the United States particularly. Progress did need
                        to be made on solving the transit problem and he expressed the strong hope
                        that both the United States and the <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Shah</persName> of Iran would continue their good efforts. However, he
                        doubted whether it was possible for there to be a successful negotiation if
                        the United States gives Pakistan the feeling of United States support for
                        its position.</p>
                    <p>The President interjected to note that the United States had only a limited
                        capacity to influence Pakistan, that each country seemed to feel that the
                        United States had the capacity to influence its neighbor although not
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>This brought a laugh from <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName>,
                        who then continued that if discussions can continue it should be possible to
                        meet the basic needs of both countries with the possible exception of the
                        question of prestige for each. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince
                            Naim</persName> stated that he had an appointment with the Iranian
                        Foreign Minister and the Pakistan Foreign Minister as soon as he returns to
                        New York, with the Iranian Foreign Minister serving as host. He hoped that
                        at that time he could convince <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                            Ali</persName> that a consulate with a senior and a junior officer is a
                        small matter to be holding up the progress of much larger interests.</p>
                    <p>He also requested that the United States continue to show its willingness to
                        continue shipping goods through Iran and to provide support for the
                        Five-Year Plan. He noted that a large amount of information had been given
                        to the United States on the plan and many discussions had been held with the
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officials but nothing definitive had
                        yet evolved. He noted that it was extremely important that aid continue to
                        flow over the Iran route if the hands of the Pakistanis were not to be
                        greatly strengthened.</p>
                    <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0363"/>
                    <p>The President replied that the United States was willing to continue shipping
                        through Iran as we have been in the recent past but that we are not in a
                        position to give a long-term commitment in detailed support of the Five-Year
                        Plan. He noted, however, that we are discussing projects with the Afghans
                        and are prepared to continue aid at least previous annual levels subject to
                        the availability of well prepared projects, Congressional appropriation of
                        funds, and satisfactory means of shipment.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> stated quite vigorously
                        that shipment through Iran to Afghanistan is possible at the same price as
                        through Pakistan. He said he understood our problem on long-term commitments
                        but he felt that the project approach was not yet working very smoothly,
                        there having been many discussions and examinations already without much
                        action.</p>
                    <p>The President promised to look personally at the status of the projects in
                        Afghanistan after Congress had appropriated funds. He noted, however, that
                        there seemed to be a real difference between the Afghans and United States
                        officials on the cost and amount of goods which could be shipped through
                        Iran. He again reiterated the need to restore transit through Pakistan. He
                        said that he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                        hoped the countries were not too far apart and could carry out careful
                        discussions in New York and Iran.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> stated once again that he
                        would talk to the Pakistanis and was confident of agreement if the
                        Pakistanis would be more flexible and stop their pressure. He noted that the
                        additional cost of shipping goods through Iran was a small cost in
                        comparison with the vastly greater costs if Afghanistan were lost to the
                        Free World. He did not feel safe now as to the future of Afghanistan; it
                        would need the moral and financial help of outsiders if it were to
                        survive.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that the United States is a long way off and even
                        though it is very anxious to be of help it can at best play a limited role.
                        He stated that he was not convinced, after talking to <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName>, that it would be possible to reach a general accord
                        but at least it ought to be possible to reach an agreement on how goods from
                        the United States can flow across Pakistan to Afghanistan. The President
                        closed on the question of the source of greatest danger: that arising from
                        complete dependence on the Soviet Union or that from some adjustment with
                        Pakistan to enable goods to flow again.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Prince Naim</persName> said, in reply, that
                        dangers are present in any course of action but that his government, as all
                        governments, must maintain its national life. Afghanistan, like West Berlin,
                        is landlocked and dependent on routes through other countries. As with West
                        Berlin, if a landlocked country does not stand up for its rights where does
                        the process of attrition stop?</p>
                    <p>The President closed the meeting by noting that there was a real problem in
                        balancing the factors involved. He assured <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Prince Naim</persName> of <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0364"/>the
                        very strong United States interest in Afghanistan and of our willingness to
                        be of assistance.</p>
                    <p>The tenor of the meeting throughout was cordial.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Fighting on the Sino-Indian border has become much more serious and has
                        imposed a heavy logistical burden on the Indians. Diplomatic efforts to ease
                        military tensions on the border have failed at least for the present. In
                        response to Indian requests, the U.S. is giving assistance to make possible
                        certain limited purchases designed to ease Indian military transport and
                        communications problems. Additionally the Departments of State and Defense
                        are studying the availability on short notice and on terms acceptable to
                        India of transport, communications and other military equipment in order to
                        be prepared should the Government of India request such U.S. equipment to
                        cope with the Chinese threat.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Military Situation:</hi></p>
                    <p>The focus of military activity has shifted from Ladakh on the western border
                        with China to a point just east of Bhutan on the eastern border along the
                        MacMahon Line. According to the Indians, some 300 to 400 Chinese troops
                        crossed the MacMahon Line on September 8 or 9, threatening Indian outposts
                        near Dhola, one to two miles inside Indian-claimed <pb n="341"
                            xml:id="pg_341" facs="0367"/>territory. In point of fact, it is unclear
                        as to whether the MacMahon Line lies north or south of this area. Firing
                        between the opposing forces began on September 20 and continued
                        intermittently, with light casualties on both sides, until October 10 when
                        it became much heavier. Both sides have accused the other of provoking the
                        initial firing on September 20. <persName>Nehru</persName> announced on
                        October 12 that in the October 10 fighting the Chinese had suffered nearly a
                        hundred casualties, and the Indians, seventeen. He said he had ordered the
                        Indian Army to clear Indian territory in the Northeast Frontier.</p>
                    <p>This is the most serious engagement of the Sino-Indian dispute. The Indians
                        claim the Communist Chinese were responsible for initiating the fighting on
                        October 10. India, however, may itself have been responsible for this action
                        in order to expel the Chinese from the Indian-claimed territory in this area
                        which is of far greater strategic importance to India than is Ladakh. While
                        we have no confirmation of Indian responsibility, the Indian Foreign
                        Secretary informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> that Indian forces have been under orders to open
                        fire on Chinese on Indian-claimed territory in the Northeast in contrast to
                        their orders to move as possible but not shoot in Ladakh. Moreover, the
                        Indian Army has greater strength and resources in this area than in
                        Ladakh.</p>
                    <p>Intelligence reports indicate that Indian air transport facilities have been
                        put under severe strain by supply operations in support of the Dhola
                        operation. We have had difficulty in arranging for routine U.S. freight
                        charter flights from Calcutta to Katmandu because of this situation.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, there have been no reports of incidents in Ladakh since
                        early September when the Indians state four Chinese soldiers were killed in
                        a still unpublicized engagement near the Chip Chap River.</p>
                    <p>We consider that the Chinese objective in shifting the focus to the East has
                        been to put additional pressure on the Indians to come to the negotiating
                        table on Chinese terms. We do not believe either side desires the conflict
                        to become more extensive than the present skirmishing on the border.
                        Considerations of “face” could, however, intensify this skirmishing. The
                        Indians are now publicly committed to expel the Chinese from Dhola and the
                        Chinese are equally committed to remain where they are.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Diplomatic Situation:</hi></p>
                    <p>India's more firm military policy, implemented last spring of stopping or
                        pushing back the Communist Chinese in Ladakh, resulted in several minor
                        military skirmishes. Concerned that the resulting military tensions should
                        not lead to a widening or intensification of the conflict beyond the point
                        of Indian capabilities, India initiated an attempt about two months ago to
                        calm the situation by diplomatic activity. (See our <pb n="342"
                            xml:id="pg_342" facs="0368"/>memorandum of August 15, 1962.)<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d174fn1">Not found.</note> In a series of notes India proposed
                        preliminary talks for the purpose of creating a climate in which later
                        negotiations on the border could take place. Under pressure from Parliament,
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s position hardened to the point of insisting
                        that such talks should have as an objective the re-establishment of the
                        previous “status quo of the border,” i.e., the withdrawal of the Chinese
                        from the parts of Ladakh which they occupied.</p>
                    <p>The Communist Chinese maintained their position in favor of negotiations on
                        the border, but “without pre-conditions,” i.e., without withdrawal or
                        acceptance of the Indian position that the border is delimited. Reasserting
                        this position the Chinese proposed that negotiations be initiated in Peiping
                        on October 15, and that both sides should withdraw 20 kilometers from their
                        present positions prior to negotiations. The Indians agreed to talks on
                        October 15, but on their own terms. With such distance between the two
                        positions, reinforced by actual fighting, the prospect for an actual meeting
                        has been dim.</p>
                    <p>In its latest note on the subject dated October 6 India repeated its
                        willingness to hold discussions with the Chinese under the conditions
                        previously indicated, but further indicated that it would not enter into
                        talks under duress and that therefore the Communist Chinese would have to
                        terminate their latest incursion across the MacMahon Line first.</p>

                        <item>On October 4 the Indian Embassy asked the U.S., in view of the
                            emergency, to agree to divert two Caribou transport airplanes, on order
                            with De Havilland of Canada, to the Indian Air Force for purchase. The
                            Secretary of Defense directed that the Defense Department comply with
                            the request and the Department of State on October 11 informed the
                            Indian Embassy of the U.S. Government's willingness to make the aircraft
                                <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0369"/>available for purchase. The
                            delivery date is expected to be in the last week of October.</item>

                        <item>Our Embassy in New Delhi informed us October 3 that the Indian Defense
                            Ministry had directed the Indian Embassy in Washington urgently to
                            request export licenses to permit the purchase of 250 ANGRC-9 radios for
                            use along the Sino-Indian border. Although the U.S. has not as yet
                            received such a request, the Army is trying to work out problems of
                            availability in advance.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In addition to the above steps taken in response to specific Indian requests,
                        we are attempting to determine what additional steps the U.S. Government
                        might take should the Government of India request further assistance. The
                        Departments of State and Defense are inquiring into the early availability
                        of transport, communications, and other military and quasi-military
                        equipment on terms which would be likely to be acceptable to India. We do
                        not plan to discuss such specific assistance with the Indians, however,
                        unless the Government of India itself raises the subject.</p>

                    <p>1225. Policy. Given the prospect of continuing and possibly more serious
                        conflict on the Northern Frontier it would seem well that we be clear as to
                        the line being pursued here in dealing with the Indian Government. If the
                        Department agrees we will continue to be guided by the following rules: <list>

                            <item>We have natural sympathy for the Indians and the problems posed by
                                the Chinese intervention.</item>

                            <item>We will be restrained in our expressions in the matter so as to
                                give the Chinese no pretext for alleging any American
                                involvement.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>We hope for a settlement acceptable to India. We should be careful
                                to avoid any suggestion that Chinese trouble may force a
                                reconsideration of India's foreign policy. If there is such

                            <item>We will not offer assistance. It is the business of the Indians to

                                case of the C-119 spares or the Caribous the request is one to which
                                we believe we should accede, we shall move with all promptness and
                                efficiency to supply the items. Mission feels that recent Washington
                                reaction on spares and Caribous was especially impressive to the

                        pressure on India to move towards settlement. Secretary doubted we could
                        apply effective pressure and speculated on the feasibility of: (1)

                        towards joint administration of Kashmir. Secretary also asked whether

                        and relief a solution to Kashmir. Secretary said US would have another look
                        at the problem.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Pak-Afghan Transit</hi></p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> said he had found
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> “inflexible” in his
                        insist-ence on return to status quo ante. He believed, however, that
                        railspurs should be built as these would eliminate trade agency problem. As
                        Pak-Afghan subject was raised only briefly, Dept later checked with
                            <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> to see whether he had
                        arrived at any kind of understanding with <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AA2">Aram</persName> in New

                        reported by <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_AA2">Aram</persName> in timing—i.e., consulates are not to

                    <p>President bore down hard on necessity keeping negotiations alive in Tehran.

                            >GOP</gloss> was using negotiations as means of putting pressure on
                        India. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> then voiced
                        familiar line on subject—saying that all <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        wanted was remove possible threat of border trouble with <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. President emphasized that threat of

                        countries do not view danger alike and it important that those who do work
                        together even though others like neutrals were getting “a free ride.”
                            <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> welcomed this point

                    <p>In general discussion I reiterated our general position of sympathy. I noted
                        that this had been affirmed by the Secretary to Mrs. Gandhi. Of the latter
                        he had not heard and asked what the Secretary had said. I gave him a general
                        account. He said he thought our policy was correct and sound and certainly
                        it was much appreciated by the Indians. I told him in turn that we fully
                        realized the difficulties of the area, and the need for a policy of caution
                        and patience noting that in US one occasionally encountered an individual
                        more concerned with proving his bravery than his wisdom.</p>

                    <p>Conversations here subsequent to dinner meeting suggest formula proposed by
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA2">Aram</persName> may be subject to different
                        interpretations. He himself says key element in formula is that Afghan
                        diplomats from Karachi should be detailed to Peshawar to perform consular
                        functions. The Persian version does not specify when regular consular
                        personnel might be assigned. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>'s
                        understanding, as described by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MMH1"
                            >Maiwandwal</persName> to us, is that Afghan Embassy officers
                        temporarily assigned to consular functions in frontier offices would be
                        replaced by regular consular officers “month or so” after diplomatic
                        relations resumed. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName>'s
                        understanding as given to the President is that these frontier offices will
                        be maintained and manned by diplomatic personnel until rail spurs are
                        completed. Then when need for trade agencies is eliminated regular consular
                        personnel will be permitted to establish regular consular posts in Peshawar
                        and Quetta. Since differences in understandings appear to be in detail and
                        timing rather than principle, formula appears promising in that it would
                        seem to allow requirements of “face” to be met. Whether it meets <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s domestic requirements is an open
                        question, however.</p>
                    <p>As indicated in Karachi's 715, <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                            Ali</persName> has sent outline formula, as he understands it, to
                        Pakistan and will discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> upon his return. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                            Ali</persName> not scheduled to leave New York until October 26. We have
                        no present intentions to make further representations to him on transit
                        problem while he is here. <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName> in
                        London and still plans go home via Moscow, arriving in Kabul at the end of
                        the month.</p>
                    <p>From here it seems we have done all we usefully can do for moment. We are
                        particularly mindful <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName>'s
                        insistence with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName> evening Sept 24 that US remain in background and
                        Iran's efforts be kept in forefront. So far Pak-Afghan squabble has recently
                        been overlooked in press here, and Tehran meeting would appear natural
                        result of <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1">Shah</persName>'s previous efforts
                        rather than result of US intervention.</p>
                    <p>We believe <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> can accept principle
                        of formula. As Foreign Secy <persName corresp="#p_DSK1">Dehlavi</persName>
                        pointed out to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                        >McConaughy</persName>, Pakistan decision rests squarely on <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and thus, ultimately, success or
                        failure also rests on him. Dept is not without hope that he will show at
                        least enough flexibility to authorize <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                            Ali</persName> to negotiate in Tehran.</p>

                            Frontier Agency. In telegram 660, October 21, the Department instructed

                        concerning serious developments on Sino-Indian frontier. Letter consists of
                        description of Chinese aggression followed by operative paragraph in which
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> says that he is confident that
                        India in this hour of crisis “shall have your sympathy and support.” (<gloss

                    <p>President told Ambassador that he would reply immediately to <gloss
                            target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s letter assuring him that he of
                        course had our full sympathy and support and that we were prepared to
                        demonstrate this attitude in ways which might be helpful to him within our
                        capabilities. President was receptive to Ambassador's suggestion that reply
                        should contain no reference to arms or to aid. Ambassador said last he had
                        heard from Delhi was that Indian Government still thinking in terms of
                        purchasing arms.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador was also told that President would instruct Ambassador <persName

                            target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and to hold himself available to sort
                        out with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and other Indian
                        officials India's needs and desires and specific ways in which we might be
                        helpful.</p>

                    <p>President asked Ambassador what would be effect on <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>'s future of Indian reverses.
                        He said that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> was an
                        Indian problem and that we were not going to say anything about him but
                        added that he was not an Indian asset. Ambassador replied that political
                        considerations would undoubtedly require that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Krishna Menon</persName> be kept on as nominal Defense Minister. On
                        basis of his information he judged that <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                            >PriMin</gloss> had in fact taken over Defense Ministry and would run it
                        with assistance of defense advisory group composed of senior military
                        officers, all of whom opposed <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Thrust of President's comments to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1"
                            >Nehru</persName> were that we were ready to be of assistance and when
                        Indians told us what would be most useful we would work out terms and
                        procedures.</p>
                    <p>For Ambassador: In connection with your determining an appropriate time for
                        you to begin exploration with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> of

                        conversation outlining serious implications of Indian reverses both in

                        stating our <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0380"/>conviction of <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> aggressive intent and action, limits
                        of which not yet definable. I stated the strong case for <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> making positive gesture of sympathy and
                        restraint to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Emphasized identity of
                        interest of both great countries of subcontinent in repelling common threat
                        which cast same shadow over both. I spelled out that if <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s keep pushing south of McMahon Line
                        in northeast, even graver and more immediate threat to Pakistan existed. I
                        said explicitly that United States shares and sympathizes with Indian
                        anxiety at mounting <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat. In
                        this context I suggested that it would be helpful and appreciated move as
                        well as major step to improve climate for future <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> negotiations, for
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to send to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, publicly or even privately, some expression
                        of sympathy, assurance against any <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        diversionary move and understanding of dangerous position faced by <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. I particularly stressed our view that an
                        action by <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to renounce opportunity to
                        capitalize on present situation would be in its own interest in making
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> more tractable and flexible in later
                        bilateral negotiations.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> assured me somewhat
                        testily that his government of course had not taken and would not take any
                        action which hamper <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> fight against
                        Chinese Communists. However, he firmly rejected any possibility of special
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> message of comfort to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. He did not consider such message would be
                        either helpful or necessary. In first place, he did not believe such message
                        would improve Indian military position vis-à-vis Chinese. Indians knew they
                        did not need to keep existing large concentrations of troops on <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> borders, and could not use or logistically
                        support any greatly increased troop strength in narrow and isolated mountain
                        passes against Chinese anyway. Secondly, while <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> fully recognized common danger in long-run of Commie
                        China to India and Pakistan, he was not as concerned as we were by current
                        Chinese penetrations since, in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> view,
                        they probably do not portend major thrust far beyond McMahon Line into India
                        proper or a challenge at this time to fundamental national security of
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Basically, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> indicated little
                        sympathy for Indian position. He felt Indians had handled situation badly,
                        issuing rash and boastful statements on intentions push back <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, giving <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >ChiCom</gloss>s some excuse for countermeasures and then proving
                        totally incapable of handling subsequent military actions.</p>
                    <p>In commenting on the Indian attitude, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> also reverted to several favorite themes, unlikelihood
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will reduce its military forces on
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> borders despite <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat and fact that Indians have
                        alienated all their neighbors except <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        He mentioned that Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan were fed up with Indian treatment
                        of them as protectorates, which policy was throwing them into arms of Commie
                        China. He thought Burmese and Ceylonese were likewise increasingly resentful
                        of India.</p>
                    <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0381"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then suggested that this might be
                        an opportune moment for United States to use its good offices to urge India
                        to settle its difficulties with Pakistan. When I pinned him down, he
                        acknowledged that what he had specifically in mind was that we use our
                        influence to induce <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to proceed now to a
                        settlement of Kashmir dispute. I responded immediately that there was no
                        reason to believe that this emergency was appropriate time for such an
                        initiative. It would undoubtedly be considered by India as effort to take
                        advantage of its extremity vis-a-vis China.</p>
                    <p>President viewed his proposal in different light, feeling that India,
                        chastened by adversity, might be impelled to honor its commitment. He
                        dismissed all other Indo-Pak differences as relatively trifling. Kashmir was
                        the only really destructive issue.</p>
                    <p>My comments on general aspects <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> reaction
                        to Indian plight will follow in separate message. I think it is clear
                        however from course of our talk that, despite great seriousness <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> threat, it will require a near
                        miracle in both India and Pakistan to wipe away the corrosive bitterness and
                        establish cooperative basis for dealing with the crisis.</p>
                    <p>We can take some satisfaction in <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                        >Ayub</persName>'s assurance, even though privately expressed only to us,
                        that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> has no intention taking advantage
                        of India's trouble.</p>
                    <p>Although we are not authorized by <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        to convey this to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, we are not prohibited
                        from doing so either.</p>
                    <p>If situation deemed to warrant it, I would recommend that we inform <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of this assurance at high level in strict
                        confidence.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> noted that the
                            United States was certain to be asked to supply military assistance to
                            India in considerable volume. He recommended that the United States make
                            clear that “any help will require Indians, in their own interest, to be
                            more considerate of our political and public opinion than in recent

                            xml:id="d185fn2">Dated October 27. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        the value of getting <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> out and
                        the possible effect of the timing of our moves in bringing this about.
                        Nonetheless, your argument in Delhi 1417 that political changes of great
                        magnitude are in the wind suggests that Indians themselves will take care of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> sooner rather than later.
                        The President's letter<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">See <ref target="#d187"

                        support, leaving next steps up to you to take with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and others in Delhi, need not have the effect
                        of supporting <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> by giving him
                        the opportunity to show his willingness to ask for U.S. aid and ours to give
                        it through him. We again urge the importance of avoiding the slightest
                        appearance of U.S. initiative and responsibility in removing <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>. Our efforts with <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> will be such as to prepare the way to
                        take advantage of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s
                        disappearance without requiring it as a condition of forward motion.
                        Therefore, we do not think you need go beyond instructions in our message of
                        yesterday suggesting you move with discretion and without any public
                        indication or explicit communication to the Prime Minister that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> unacceptable to U.S. By timing of
                        your moves after you deliver the President's letter to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, you can help to bring about results you
                        desire.</p>
                    <p>Department will shortly be sending their response to your 1417. This will
                        have been drafted by <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> in close

                        avoid use of private channel unless absolutely critical because confusion of

                        other matters. The President, however, is interested and concerned and I am
                        keeping him as fully up on the situation as his time permits.</p>

                        wrangle. In my judgment, the long-run significance of this move cannot be
                        exaggerated. The Chinese Communists, having established themselves on the
                        near slopes of the Himalayas, will have secured a favorable position for
                        further aggression. Thus they will put themselves in a politically dominant
                        posture vis-a-vis India. But I think <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0385"
                        />that this will be more than counter-balanced if their aggression has the
                        effect of awakening India to the dangerous intentions of the Peiping regime,
                        and turning the attention of the Indian Government and people to their true
                        long-run security interests. These are interests which we all share.
                        Certainly the United States as a leader of the free world must take alarm at
                        any aggressive expansion of Communist power, and you as the leader of the
                        other great nation in the subcontinent will share this alarm.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, press comment in Pakistan has already produced a negative
                        reaction in India. This is particularly distressing at a time when a unique
                        opportunity exists for laying the basis for future solidarity.</p>
                    <p>We now intend to give the Indians such help as we can for their immediate
                        needs. We will ensure, of course, that whatever help we give will be used
                        only against the Chinese. You, on your part, are in a position to make a
                        move of the greatest importance which only you can make. This is to signal
                        to the Indians in a quiet but effective way that the concerns—which you know
                        I think totally unjustified—that have led them to maintain the greater part
                        of their military power on their borders with you, should be put aside in
                        the present crisis. Perhaps an effective way would be a private message from
                        you to <persName>Nehru</persName>. You could tell him that he can count on
                        Pakistan's taking no action on the frontiers to alarm India. No possible
                        outside aid can increase the ability of the Indians to withstand the Chinese
                        offensive as much as a shift in their own dispositions.</p>
                    <p>Knowing the history of Kashmir, I do not make this suggestion lightly, but in
                        the hope and belief that the painful moments which India is now experiencing
                        will teach them how much more important the threat from the North is to the
                        whole of the subcontinent than any regional quarrels within it. Our own
                        recent experience with the response of our Latin American neighbors when
                        they were confronted with the Soviet threat in Cuba gives me ground for this
                        belief. Action taken by you now in the larger interests of the subcontinent
                        will do more in the long run to bring about a sensible resolution of
                        Pakistan-Indian differences than anything else I can think of.</p>
                    <p>Further, I am sure that the lesson of such a change in Indian dispositions
                        would not be lost on the Peiping regime. Communism has always advanced in
                        the face of disunity in the free world. This crisis is a test of the vision
                        of all of us, our sense of proportion and our sense of the historic destiny
                        of the free nations.</p>

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>“Your Ambassador handed me your letter last night. The occasion of it is a
                        difficult and painful one for you and a sad one for the whole world. Yet
                        there is a sense in which I welcome your letter, because it permits me to
                        say to you what has been in my mind since the Chinese Communists have begun
                        to press their aggressive attack into Indian territory. I know I can speak
                        for my whole country, when I say that our sympathy in this situation is
                        wholeheartedly with you. You have displayed an impressive degree of
                        forbearance and patience in dealing with the Chinese. You have put into
                        practice what all great religious teachers have urged and so few of their
                        followers have been able to do. Alas, this teaching seems to be effective
                        only when it is shared by both sides in a dispute.</p>
                    <p>“I want to give you support as well as sympathy. This is a practical matter
                        and, if you wish, my Ambassador in New Delhi can discuss with you and the
                        officials of your Government what we can do to translate our support into
                        terms that are practically most useful to you as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>“With all sympathy for India and warmest personal good wishes.</p>

                        Staff. The last fortnight has presented us here with an interesting problem
                        in being abreast of and giving a measure of guidance to a great change in
                        Indian policy. To have been ahead of the change would <pb n="362"
                            xml:id="pg_362" facs="0388"/>have aroused grave suspicion. To have been
                        behind would have invited the same discredit into which some of India's
                        other professed friends have fallen. On the whole things have gone well. And
                        I have great admiration for the way that Washington, the heavy distractions
                        of the Cuban crisis notwithstanding, has provided intellectual, moral and
                        material support and guidance. This is not the voice of the most banal
                        believer in American perfection in these matters.</p>
                    <p>In the days ahead I see a new danger. That is that in our natural desire to
                        help the Indians we will overwhelm them. They do not want to break quickly
                        with their past beliefs. Words like nonalignment still have great evocative
                        power. Phrases like military blocs, military alliances, even Pentagon still
                        have a bad sound. In particular a large influx of American military
                        personnel however well-intentioned could have a most damaging effect. And
                        numbers could quickly get beyond my power to control and guide our political
                        posture and response. You will already have seen in my cables indications of
                        my anxiety that I be consulted on all plans to send people here and that it
                        be clear to all who come that they are under my full organizational
                        direction and control and that we select scrupulously for quality as opposed
                        to numbers or conventional tables of organization. This no doubt reflects
                        normal bureaucratic attitudes which I have acquired with remarkable celerity
                        but it also reflects my deep concern for the complex task we face here and
                        my hope that it can be discharged with credit to all of us. At this end we
                        will continue to insure an environment in which the officers we request will
                        function in a closely-knit and harmonious group that will, I trust, reflect
                        full credit on the organization and services whence they come and which
                        fully reflect the concerns and views of the latter. If my requests for help
                        seem unduly modest or even if it should occasionally be evident that larger
                        numbers might produce slightly better guidance to Indians or slightly more
                        refined requirements you will realize I am sure that I am acting in response
                        to overall considerations of our position here.<note n="1" xml:id="d189fn1"

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>Attached is the current situation report on the Sino-Indian border war you
                        requested. It was prepared by the Department of State, in consultation with
                        the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense. It represents
                        the agreed views of all three.</p>
                    <p>I would add one comment on section 3 of the memorandum. Section 3-b (page 5)
                        is devoted to difficulties that the new situation in India will raise for
                        our relations with Pakistan. It seems to me that the problem could be stated
                        a little more sharply in a somewhat different way. We are now faced with the
                        necessity of making the Pakistani realize that their alliance with us had
                        been of immense value to them. This comprises not only the substantial
                        economic and military assistance we have given, but also the general support
                        that the alliance provides in their relations with India. They are obviously
                        the weaker power, and they have been able to maintain as strong a line on
                        Kashmir as they have in part because of the existence of our support in the
                        background. We are now beginning to confront them with the fact that we are
                        really not able to support their demand for a settlement via plebiscite, and
                        that their best opportunity for settlement on terms something like
                        ratification of the status quo may be passing from their grasp. This will be
                        a difficult and painful process, but it is one we must push through.</p>

                                target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>) have resulted in Chinese advances at
                            a number of points, some of them approximately 15 miles south of the
                            McMahon Line, and in Ladakh the Chinese Communists have overcome Indian
                            forward positions and threaten the principal Indian bases in that area.
                            Moreover, the Soviet Union has supported Peking's proposals for
                            negotiation on terms unacceptable to the Indians. These developments
                            strike at the heart of India's policy of nonalignment and have
                            far-reaching internal consequences. India has turned to the West for
                            assistance in meeting its military requirements. The development of a
                            closer Western relationship with India is causing an almost traumatic
                            reaction in Pakistan. Pakistan's foreign policy over the past decade has
                            been directed in large part towards correcting the imbalance of power
                            with India through the special alliance relationship with the West.</p>

                        <p>The present phase of the Sino-Indian border conflict began early last
                            spring when India decided to put out advanced patrols and outposts in
                            the Ladakh area in an effort to forestall further Chinese advances there
                            and eventually to push back some of the Chinese outposts. In July the
                            Chinese demanded that the Indians withdraw their forward patrols and
                            threatened, if they did not do so, to invade <gloss target="#t_NEFA1"
                                >NEFA</gloss>. Instead of withdrawing, the Indians intensified their
                            forward patrolling activities in the months that followed.</p>
                        <p>There is now evidence that in August and early September the Chinese
                            concentrated their troops at points along the <gloss target="#t_NEFA1"
                                >NEFA</gloss> border. They launched an attack on October 20. Within
                            a week the Chinese Communist forces advanced at several places within
                                <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>, reaching at one point near
                            the Bhutan border a position approximately 15 miles south of the McMahon
                            Line. Simultaneously, the Chinese attacked in Ladakh and eliminated the
                            forward posts established by the Indians last spring and summer.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">In the northwest (Ladakh), about 6,000 Indian

                                    >NEFA</gloss> there are some 30,000 Indian troops opposing the

                                reserve across the border. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            Total Indian casualties are in the neighborhood of 5,000.</p>
                        <p>Chinese gains have been a result of a combination of advantages over the
                            Indians, most notably a better supply situation, more modern equipment
                            and larger numbers of men.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, the Chinese seem to have halted their advance in
                                <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>. In Ladakh the Chinese have
                            also halted along the boundary line which they claimed in 1960, but they
                            are in a position to move against important Indian positions just west
                            of this line.</p>

                        <p>As the Chinese have moved further into Indian-claimed territory, their
                            supply problems have increased but even so they still appear to have a
                            limited advantage over the Indians in this respect. The present halt in
                            the Chinese Communist advance may be designed to permit them to regroup,
                            resupply and prepare for further limited advances. At a minimum the
                            Chinese Communists will consolidate, with some minor tactical
                            adjustments, and dig into their positions in preparation for the severe
                            winter. The indications are that they want to hold the territory which
                            they now occupy, at least as a bargaining counter; they show no
                            particular interest in a negotiated settlement; nor do they seem
                            interested thus far in extending their military activities beyond the
                            disputed border areas. Future Chinese Communist military action may well
                            be determined in large part by Indian moves.</p>

                        <p>The rapid Chinese advances in both <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>
                            and Ladakh have had a profound effect on Indian political thinking. The
                            Indian leaders are being forced to re-examine some of the basic
                            assumptions which have been central to Indian political life and
                            attitudes. The great exponent of peaceful coexistence has been attacked
                            by a nation which ostentatiously shared this attitude. The effectiveness
                            of nonalignment as a policy has been clearly brought into question. The
                            Soviet Union's action in supporting an unacceptable Chinese Communist
                            offer to negotiate the conflict has led the Indians to rethink their
                            thesis that they could count on the Soviet Union to restrain the Chinese
                            Communists and to provide India with substantial quantities of military
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>These developments cannot but have a far-reaching effect on the internal
                            Indian power structure. The demotion of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"

                        <p>India has also approached the United Kingdom, Canada, and France with
                            requests for various types of military equipment primarily in the field
                            of small arms, infantry support and anti-tank weapons, together with
                            necessary ammunition, communications equipment, transport aircraft, and
                            helicopters. India has also requested rapid delivery of equipment
                            previously ordered, and apparently is making direct commercial inquiries
                            about procuring aircraft in the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Canada is currently attempting to determine availability of a wide range
                            of equipment which would be useful to India. The United Kingdom has
                            air-lifted a small amount of automatic rifles and ammunition, and is
                            also determining availability of other items. The French have also
                            air-lifted a small amount of small arms.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Turkey has offered India some light mountain artillery and
                            ammunition. We anticipate this equipment will be available for shipment
                            within the next two or three days, at which time we will airship it to
                            India.</p>

                                Western sympathy and support and Western military equipment will
                                profoundly affect Indian thinking. We can expect the Indians to
                                redefine their nonalignment policy, but we do not expect India to
                                abandon this policy. Although India has been forced to re-examine
                                the dimensions of its relations with the Soviet Union, we anticipate
                                that India will try to avoid doing anything which would further

                                    Despite Pakistan's very great dependence on the United States,
                                    this may be the most difficult problem ahead. We had hoped that

                                <p>All present signs, however, point to at least a temporary
                                    widening of the breech between Pakistan and India, a Pakistani
                                    reassessment of the value of its alliance with the United States
                                    and increased political tensions within the country. Pakistan,
                                    which sought an alliance with the United States chiefly to
                                    offset India's preponderant military strength in the
                                    subcontinent, sees the value of this alliance much reduced in
                                    the face of United States military assistance to India. This
                                    situation bears the closest watch because Pakistan is, in fact,
                                    going through a traumatic experience almost equal to that of

                                the principal factors will be the impact of increased Indian
                                military expenditures on the achievement of Indian devaelopment
                                goals. The extent of this impact will depend in large part on how
                                the Indians define their military objectives, the extent of
                                resources diverted for this purpose, and the division of western

                            >GOP</gloss> position. He said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was
                        sad that Sino-Indian border dispute had erupted into open war, but <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> unable on basis of incomplete information
                        available to it assess who initiated attack. Implied some responsibility

                        considers conflict limited war. Conflict limited in terms <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> immediate tactical objectives,
                        equipment employed and number of men involved. Furthermore, if <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had more than limited objectives,
                        offensive would have been launched in May rather than in October when
                        weather bad and frost already in area throughout day. <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> attack also made in mountainous area

                            >ChiCom</gloss>s wished seriously invade India now they would have come
                        through easier traditional route via Burma, which about ripe anyway for
                        communist takeover. Consequently, defense preparations in India and arms aid
                        to it in his judgment far exceed limited current requirements of actual
                        military situation in areas where fighting now taking place. At later point,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> reverted to above theme and
                        said as military man he unable understand Indian defeats except as tactical
                        misjudgment of incompetent leadership, since he knew from personal
                        experience good fighting quality Indian forces and satisfactory arms
                        available to them.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then blamed
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> for development of crisis saying that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s policies had always been mistaken. Four
                        pillars of Indian foreign policy—neutralism, isolation Pakistan, opposition
                        western objectives, and anti-Americanism—now demonstrated to be complete
                        mistake. Nevertheless, India still maintains 80 percent of its armed forces
                        on Pakistan borders with remainder 10 days away; almost all Indian Navy in
                            <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0396"/>Bombay in threatening posture
                        to Pakistan. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said
                        while one Indian infantry division and one brigade withdrawn from Pakistan
                        border, Pakistan intelligence has reported that one armored division and one
                        armored brigade moving to points close to Pakistan borders.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said under these circumstances
                        Pakistanis had right to maintain own self-respect in own self-defense.
                        Objective of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> foreign policy he stressed
                        several times was to free both India and Pakistan from anxiety about each
                        other through settlement of differences including Kashmir. While Pakistan
                        was not going to take advantage of Indian situation, only common sense for
                        it to take precautions necessary for self- defense.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then discussed recent US actions
                        in response Sino-Indian border situation. He said we have of course right to
                        provide India with arms. However, he feels he has right to complain on the
                        failure to consult with him in advance as promised by President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. Situation which has arisen is
                        exactly that envisaged in understanding as calling for advance consultation
                        before arms provided. He said he was grateful for assurances of the
                        President on use of US arms only against <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >ChiCom</gloss>s but he would not have asked for such assurances since
                        India not to be trusted. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then
                        complained with obvious personal hurt regarding our pressures on him to make
                        gesture to India. He said patience of Pakistani people who friends of US not
                        beyond limit and they interpreted request for gesture as demonstration US
                        not sympathetic with, nor understanding of Pakistan position and essential
                        interests. This clear in Pakistani press. Although <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> trying quiet hostile press reaction, it difficult resist
                        people's just feelings. Pakistan has free press, learned from US example,
                        and cannot be controlled. Instead of pressuring Pakistan, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> urged that we encourage India
                        establish friendly relations with its neighbors and by conciliatory moves
                        which are long overdue court peace with Pakistan. Pakistan was prepared at
                        any time to establish friendly relations with India. Later in discussion,
                        when I pressed him, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was more
                        specific and said that he was prepared to more than reciprocate any change
                        of heart on India's part but that was as far as Pakistan would go since it
                        the aggressed one, oppressed, aggrieved party and since India was a bigger
                        nation. Said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was replying at once to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s circular appeal to heads of other
                        governments for sympathy. He cited non-personal nature of this appeal as
                        another example of <persName>Nehru</persName>'s ineptitude and unwillingness
                        to take initiative on specific overtures designed to meet India's problem
                        here. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said <gloss

                    <p>Following this, I urged <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to forego

                    <p>I then discussed with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> our

                        stating conviction that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>

                        and that his change of portfolios was a mere tactical maneuver engineered by
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName> so that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                        could escape some of blame for current reverses. I took issue with this
                        interpretation. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> restated <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> view that Indians remain hostile to
                        Pakistan and must demonstrate changed attitude first before Paks make
                        reciprocal gesture. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> also
                        reverted to complaints that US pressuring Pakistan rather than India. In
                        this connection he asked why Paks as friends of US always expected to make
                        practically all the concessions to unfriendly neighbors who are not allies
                        of US; he referred to the difficult concessions to Afghanistan which the US
                        Government was pressuring him to make, and now again he is asked to make
                        unilateral concessions to India involving, in his view, a certain
                        indifference to essential Pakistani national and security interests. He
                        thought US should instead be pressuring India to make tangible conciliatory
                        gesture to Pakistan if effective effort against <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >ChiCom</gloss>s and disengagement Pak-Indian forces (which he agreed to
                        be desirable) were sought. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> could not be
                        expected allow its security be jeopardized or to bow to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, who was enemy of India's real interests, as
                        well as Pakistan's. In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> agreed again to reciprocate more equally any change of
                        heart on India's part, stating he would fail in his duty to country if he
                        did not reciprocate since Pakistan's basic aim is to establish conditions
                        where both countries are free from anxiety and fear of the other.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> My fuller comments will follow on further
                        reflection. I had impression throughout our discussion, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was restrained and calm although
                        inwardly angered and upset. I had no chance to change his fundamental
                        position, since decision already made and letter written. However, I believe
                        his view of our action, motivations and attitude was somewhat better at end
                        of session than at beginning. At no point did he threaten change of policy
                        towards US or towards alliances but clearly he felt that Pakistan, and he
                        personally, as friends of US had been let down by US, particularly through
                        failure to consult with him in advance on military aid to India and through
                        our pressures on Pakistan alone to make first gesture towards India.</p>
                    <p>Although he carefully refrained from explicitly reiterating his October 26
                        assurance to me about not creating trouble for India at this time, he
                        clearly stated that it would not be common sense for Pakistan to precipitate
                        military action against India, and of course Pakistan did not have any
                        intention of doing so.</p>

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>You asked two questions this morning about India: (1) What have we done to
                        keep the Paks informed of our military assistance to India? and (2) How much
                        have we actually shipped?</p>
                    <p>On the first, <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> has talked to
                            <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz Ahmed</persName>, the Pakistan
                        Ambassador, twice in the last ten days. He has emphasized to him that our
                        help is limited to the problem of defending India against Chinese
                        aggression, and that we were getting assurances from the Indians that were
                        as effective as the assurances that the Paks had given us about the use of
                        our military assistance to them. So far, he has described the nature of the
                        weapons we have shipped, but not the exact quantities. The next time he sees
                        him, which will be shortly, he will tell him something of the order of
                        magnitude of the quantities. This has as yet had no visible effect in
                        reassuring <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz</persName>.</p>
                    <p>On the second, as of now we have shipped by air about $3-1/2 million worth
                        (including shipping costs) of equipment and ammunition, adding up to some
                        800 tons. The list in the attached table<note n="1" xml:id="d192fn1">Not
                            printed.</note> shows the consolidated Indian request, what we have
                        already shipped, and what will be shipped this weekend. We of course don't
                        necessarily agree that everything they have requested should be shipped.</p>

                    <p>The Pakistani are going through a genuine emotional crisis as they see their
                        cherished ambitions of using the US as a lever against India going up in the
                        smoke of the Chinese border war. Their plaint about lack of consultation is
                        mere cover for this (if we'd “consulted” with the Paks, instead of notifying
                        them, we'd still be arguing about Kashmir).</p>
                    <p>Given <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> bitterness, our pitch should be
                        sympathetic understanding and no pressure. We can let the facts themselves
                        work for us.</p>
                    <p>But I urge equally strongly that there be no give in our position. We have no
                        need to apologize. If we compensate <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> for our actions vis-a-vis India, we will again be
                        postponing the long-needed clarification of our position, and this at a time
                        when we've never had a better excuse for clarifying it.</p>
                    <p>Whether Pakistan moves from words to action depends on whether it is willing
                        to risk its relationship with the US. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> probably isn't, but he may be a prisoner of <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> public emotions in this case. Moreover,
                        even <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has found that a hard line
                        often works well with us. I am convinced, however, that in the last analysis
                        the Paks will realize that they get far too much from their US tie to be
                        able to do without it. So if we can weather the current shock, we should be
                        able to hold on to our assets in Pakistan, while still emerging with the
                        sub-continent-wide policy toward which we aim.</p>

                    <p>President suggested that while still uncertain whether Chinese intentions
                        limited or to dominate area, India taking situation seriously, perhaps more
                        so than President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Ambassador
                        agreed that even if Chinese take only territory in dispute, it serious for
                        India. Said Pakistan believes China wants to take disputed area, face India
                        with a fait accompli, and then negotiate end of hostilities. Fact that

                        don't expect big war in prospect. However, perhaps next spring situation
                        will be clearer.</p>
                    <p>President said he recognized Pakistan Government's interest in settling
                        Kashmir dispute, asked what Pakistan thinks best course to achieve this.
                        Ambassador answered that Pakistan understands that in India official circles
                        building up a trend of feeling toward rapprochement with Pakistan. Pakistan
                        believes this should be encouraged. Any gesture by Pakistan, e.g. to pull
                        troops back from Kashmir border, would halt this favorable trend. He
                        repeated familiar arguments that whole region will stay insecure, unstable
                        and economically retarded so long as the Kashmir dispute remains unsettled.
                        Pakistani people very much exercised over military assistance to India, he
                        said, because, basing idea of what India might do in future on what it has
                        done in past, Pakistan persuaded that any large scale assistance to India
                        would only strengthen India against Pakistan and India would use this
                        equipment at first opportunity against Pakistan. All political leaders have
                        opposed the grant of military assistance to India by the US and the question
                        of giving any Pakistani assurances to India.</p>
                    <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0403"/>
                    <p>President, replying deliberately and clearly, said question of assurances is
                        matter for Pakistani decision, but US is interested in stopping the advance
                        of Communism in Asia. Amount of US aid, as Ambassador knows, is minimal; if
                        it should grow large we would discuss matter with Pakistan. It is important,
                        President continued, that US indicate its opposition to the expansion of the
                        Communist Chinese in Asia. We understand problem of Kashmir. Possibly out of
                        all this will come some settlement. Can also understand <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s feeling that what is happening to
                        India is result of its own foolish policies. On other hand, US cannot stand
                        by idly while China tries to expand its power in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador returned once more to argument that if threat is real, what is
                        important is not giving arms but freeing the Indian Army to fight against
                        Chinese. At present, India fighting with hands tied behind back. This not
                        merely question of improving relations between India and Pakistan but of
                        stopping Communists. He did not see how India can accomplish this end unless
                        it settled Kashmir with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>President responded merely that he would be in touch with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> again.</p>

                    <p>5th November, 1962</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                    <p>I am grateful to you for your kind message of October 28, 1962,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d195fn2">See <ref target="#d186">Document 186</ref>.</note>
                        which was delivered by your Ambassador.</p>
                    <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0404"/>
                    <p>For the last fifteen years, India has posed a major military threat to
                        Pakistan. She has built up her forces, may I say, mainly with American and
                        British equipment three to four times our strength and has openly declared
                        that Pakistan is her enemy number one.</p>
                    <p>Eighty per cent or more of her Armed Forces have already been earmarked
                        against us and the bulk of them remain concentrated on our borders on ten
                        days' state of readiness. We have been exposed to these aggressive designs
                        all these years simply because the Indian Prime Minister himself is not
                        prepared to honour his pledge in regard to so many agreements and especially
                        in regard to the solution of Kashmir in which Pakistan is vitally interested
                        for profound economic and security reasons. Therefore, by and large, we have
                        spent these fifteen years in a state of mobilization which has been forced
                        upon us by India. On top of all this, the recent conflict between India and
                        China has led to developments of grave concern to us.</p>
                    <p>However, our own information, although meagre, leads us to believe that
                        Chinese intention seems to be to occupy the territory which they believe
                        belongs to them and over which there has been a dispute between her and
                        India. Even Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> thought it fit in his wisdom to
                        declare in the Indian Parliament in 1954 with reference to the Chinese
                        position in Tibet that ‘I am not aware of any time during the last few
                        hundred years when Chinese sovereignty, or if you like suzerainty, was
                        challenged by any outside country. All during this period, whether China was
                        weak or strong, or whatever the Government of China was, China always
                        maintained its claim to sovereignty over Tibet… . The British Empire in the
                        days of <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord</persName> Curzon had expanded
                        into and made several types of arrangements in Tibet. Now it is impossible
                        or improper for us to continue any such arrangements … . These maps and
                        treaties are all prepared by the British Imperialists. These treaties and
                        maps are intended to show that we must act as they did.'</p>
                    <p>Militarily, however, we do not believe that China can bring to bear against
                        India her major forces through the difficult terrain of the Himalayas to
                        achieve decisive results, and even if she has any such intention the way to
                        do it would be to outflank India through Burma. In our opinion, that would
                        be a simpler way of doing it and in cost it would be cheaper. If the Chinese
                        intentions were more than limited and they were to expand into the
                        territories of Assam, we would have as much cause for concern as India, as
                        our East Pakistan would be directly affected. We are making this
                        appreciation about the actual situation in no light hearted mood.</p>
                    <p>Why has such a situation developed on this sub-continent and around India? We
                        believe that this is the direct outcome of distorted and fallacious thinking
                        on the part of Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName> and his associates and a
                        consequence of a baseless foreign policy that he has been following. This
                        foreign policy has been based on the following factors: <pb n="379"

                    <p>The events have proved that all that is happening to Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> is the direct consequence of this warped
                        thinking. We have been warning and pointing to this all along.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, what you now ask of us is to give an assurance to Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> of a kind that will enable him to deploy his
                        troops at present concentrated against us elsewhere. I am surprised that
                        such a request is being made to us. After all, what we have been doing is
                        nothing but to contain the threat that was continuously posed by India to
                        us. Is it in conformity with human nature that we should cease to take such
                        steps which are necessary for our self-preservation? Or, will our own people
                        ever accept such a position?</p>
                    <p>According to our information, India has withdrawn an infantry division and a
                        half away from us but there are definite indications that they are moving
                        forward their reserve armoured formations of one division and one brigade to
                        battle locations against Pakistan. Similarly they now have a corps
                        headquarters to control troops deployed against East Pakistan. The bulk of
                        their Navy, barring a couple of small vessels, have been concentrated in
                        Bombay harbour, ostensibly for refit but in reality to pose a threat to us.
                        Under no stretch of imagination, Mr. President, can these moves be described
                        as indications of peaceful intentions towards us by India. So, how can we,
                        in a situation like this, be expected to show our friendship to them!</p>
                    <p>No, Mr. President, the answer to this problem lies elsewhere. It lies in
                        creating a situation whereby we are free from the Indian threat, and the
                        Indians are free from any apprehensions about us. This can only be done if
                        there is a settlement of the question of Kashmir. This matter is sometimes
                        stated as very difficult to resolve. I do not agree with that. I believe
                        that if there is a change of heart on the part of India, it should not be
                        difficult to find an equitable and an honourable settlement.</p>
                    <p>Our object is to have peace, and especially with our neighbours. I am very
                        grateful for the assurance you have given that the arms you are now
                        supplying to India will not be used against us. This is very generous of
                        you, but knowing the sort of people you are dealing with, whose history is a
                        continuous tale of broken pledges, I would not ask a friend like you to
                        place yourself in an embarrassing situation. India's conduct over the
                        question of Junagadh, Mangrol, Hyderabad, Kashmir and Goa should be
                        well-known to you. Our belief is that arms now being obtained by <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0406"/>India from you for use against China will
                        undoubtedly be used against us at the very first opportunity. However, in
                        the light of the promise that you were good enough to make, namely, that we
                        shall be consulted before you gave any military assistance to India, we did
                        expect to be consulted and also informed as to the types and the quantities
                        of weapons and equipment which are now in the process of being supplied to
                        them. It is regrettable that none of this has been done.</p>
                    <p>I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that although India
                        today poses as an aggrieved and oppressed party, in reality she has been
                        constantly threatening and intimidating, in varying degrees, small
                        neighbouring countries around her. Let me assure you that in the eyes of
                        many people in free Asia, Indian intentions are suspect and the Indian image
                        as a peace-loving nation has been destroyed.</p>
                    <p>You have referred, Mr. President, to press comments in Pakistan. While we
                        have endeavoured to restrain expression of extremist views in our
                        newspapers, it is not possible to interfere with the freedom of the press
                        which reflects the real sentiment of the people. It must be realized that
                        public opinion is gravely exercised by the new developments as the result of
                        arms aid to India, more so, as India continues to pose a serious threat to
                        our security. I am afraid it is going to be extremely difficult for my
                        Government to discount public opinion.</p>

                        change in public attitudes since World War II. The most treasured of
                        preconceptions have been shattered. The disillusion with the Chinese is of
                        course total. So, save at the top, is that with the Soviets. And the other
                        unaligneds are not very popular. <persName>Nehru</persName> remains an
                        exception. Even he is now hoping only for friendly neutrality from the
                        Soviets rather than active support. But with him there is another factor.
                        All his life he has sought to avoid being dependent upon the United States
                        and the United Kingdom—most of his personal reluctance to ask (or thank) for
                        aid has been based on this pride. He did not like it because it advertised
                        what hurt his pride. Now nothing is so important to him, more personally
                        than politically, than to maintain the semblance of this independence. His
                        age no longer allows for readjustment. To a point we can, I feel, be
                        generous on this.</p>
                    <p>The departure of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> is an enormous
                        gain. I have little doubt that in recent years he was an immediate and
                        efficient channel of communications to the Soviets and possibly even to the
                        Chinese. His departure means, among other things, that we can work with the
                        Indians on sensitive matters—things which I resisted before because of the
                        insecurity involved—although the Indian Government remains a sieve and his
                        men are still around. More important he no longer has the capacity for
                        stirring up action against us or for the Communists. Many people here think
                        that in recent years whenever the Chinese penetrated a little further in
                        Ladakh, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> arranged some shooting
                        on the East Pakistan border as a diversion. I have no doubt that the march
                        on Goa last year was timed to take peoples minds away from the anti-Chinese
                        syndrome which was developing as the result of last summer's penetrations.
                        It worked. Within a few days last December China disappeared from the
                        headlines and the liberating forces of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName> became the center of attention. The U.N. job was an
                        admirable complement to all this for it made him the defender of Kashmir and
                        gave him a forum for whipping it up against us.</p>
                    <p>In the United States we no longer think of an individual having this much
                        power. But there is still a role here for a Rasputin. And all of this is
                        apart from <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s utter
                        incompetence as a Defense Minister and his deeply divisive political
                        influence on the Army.</p>
                    <p>At one juncture, I feared that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                        might engineer the turnaround and get credit for the appeal to the United
                        States for aid. And it is a measure of his conscienceless gall that he made
                        the effort. I managed to forestall this without any suggestion, even from
                        the <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> kept press, that we had a
                        role in throwing him out. In the absence of your counsel on the <pb n="382"
                            xml:id="pg_382" facs="0408"/>matter I might have pressed the point a
                        little harder. But I was also desirous that no one in Washington, yourself
                        included, would think me at all anxious to rush arms to a ministry headed by
                        this man.</p>
                    <p>The Government is currently in disarray. The Prime Minister is old and tired
                        and angry with events that have treated him so harshly. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CYB1">Chavan</persName>, who is coming in as Defence
                        Minister, is young by Indian standards. He is a competent politician and
                        operator. No one need pay any attention to the suggestions that he is left
                        wing—he has merely made his obeisances. Unfortunately he is very
                        inexperienced in all military matters—as are all Indians. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTT1">T.T. Krishnamachari</persName>, who will take over as
                        Minister of Supply, was at one time head of Lever Brothers here and is a man
                        of incredible vanity. He was brought into the Cabinet at <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>'s behest but sensed at an early
                        stage that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> was in trouble. He
                        thereupon broke with him on grounds of principle reinforced by more
                        practical considerations. He tries to live up to his view of himself and
                        about halfway succeeds. So he will be fairly effective. My working
                        relationships with both men are good.</p>
                    <p>One thing much on my mind these last days has been the American press. We
                        have had a great influx of correspondents plus a large itinerant delegation
                        covering the arms lift. Under <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                        the Indian Defence Ministry completely excluded the press from all
                        operational areas—partly so no one would hear the criticisms of <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>. Were they bottled up here, the
                        Indians would get a bad press and so, inter alia, would we. I have now
                        pretty well broken through on this, though I had to go to the Prime Minister
                        himself. There will be many stories on the infirm character of his
                        leadership, but that is not our business. I think <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        is still playing down our role to protect the sensitivities of the Soviets
                        and perhaps, more especially, to protect his own feelings. I have told him
                        this was something we couldn't take and have pictured the repercussions in
                        the American press. We cannot decently help someone who is afraid to be seen
                        in our company. There will be some damage along these lines, I fear.</p>
                    <p>The great question is what the Chinese intend. In the beginning I thought
                        that this was essentially a border conflict. The Chinese have a serious
                        claim to the Aksai Chin Plateau in Ladakh. It provides them with a strategic
                        access to Sinkiang and they had been building their road there for two years
                        before the Indians reacted. By getting a good foothold in the east, they
                        could establish a claim for the area they really want. In addition, no
                        doubt, they are motivated by jealousy and dislike plus the feeling that
                        Indians were the world's safest object of animosity. So with their superior
                        ready manpower and equipment they could show the Indians and the Asian
                        countries that in military affairs at least they had superiority. All this
                        could be accomplished by a major border demonstration. I have not entirely
                        discarded the above theory. But last week the trickle of evidence on forces
                        north on the frontier, the concentration in the <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
                            facs="0409"/>real danger areas which are the Chumbi Valley and back near
                        the Burma border, the incursions and patrol actions in new places and the
                        drift of Chinese propaganda caused me to conclude that we should assume
                        something more serious. The Indians have consistently underestimated Chinese
                        intentions. In one way or another our estimate influences them. And, of
                        course, we are in less danger if we have to withdraw from a too somber
                        estimate than if we must revise a too sanguine one. In the former instance
                        we shall have at least done some of the right things. My recent estimates
                        have reflected the above considerations. Deep in my own mind I am not
                        persuaded that the Chinese are as ambitious as this implies or that they can
                        be so indifferent to the deterrent effects of our position.</p>
                    <p>If the Chinese should really come down the mountain in force, there will be
                        more political changes here. Much so-called nonalignment went out the window
                        with <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>. In his pro-Soviet
                        maneuvers and his articulate anti-Americanism he was the counterbalance for
                        five ordinary pro-Western ministers. Popular opinion and our military
                        assistance has worked a further and major impairment. The problem in face of
                        a really serious attack would be how we would react to the prospect of a
                        new, large and extremely expensive ally. I personally hope the Chinese do
                        not force this choice. The Indians are busy worrying about the end of
                        non-alignment. It is we that should be doing the worrying on this.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, I think our affairs here are in good shape. We have
                        managed to appear as a solid and steadfast friend. Even the left press has
                        not seriously pinned on us the charge that we are seeking to entangle or
                        otherwise exploit the situation. On most matters our course has seemed
                        clear. During the Cuban affair I moved ahead but with a fairly good sense of
                        what would be in your mind. The period has not been without interest.</p>
                    <p>We do have a serious problem next door and this has been much on my mind. The
                        Pakistanis have not taken the attack very seriously and have seen it as the
                        great opportunity to get concessions from the Indians. As I am sure
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> himself saw, no one could
                        press the Indians in their moment of despair. But instead the Paks were
                        pressed themselves for assurances. And our weapons, in an action not too
                        gracefully cleared with the Paks started coming to India. Their
                        disappointment is understandable. I have worked hard and I think with a
                        certain measure of success here. The Ministry of External Affairs at my
                        behest has asked the press to be very quiet in response to the Pakistan
                        fulminations. I have given strong encouragement to a Congress Party group
                        which is urging reconciliation with Pakistan. I have pressed the Indians to
                        give the Pakistanis information on Indian troop movements and I succeeded
                        last week in getting <persName>Nehru</persName> to write a long and friendly
                        letter to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> on the situation,
                        while their new High Commissioner is proposing the resumption of ministerial
                        talks. Meanwhile <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> has been
                        doing noble <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0410"/>work in Karachi to calm
                        the Paks and make them see that the threat is to the subcontinent. My sense
                        of the situation is that we should not press the Pakistanis any more in the
                        immediate future. However I should continue all moderating efforts here.
                        Eventually but not too soon the Indians must be asked to propose meaningful
                        negotiations on Kashmir. This should not incidentally raise the question of
                        a plebiscite, an idea in which there is no longer any future. The only hope
                        lies in having a full guarantee of the headwaters of the rivers. Each side
                        should hold on to the mountain territory that it has and there should be
                        some sort of shared responsibility for the Valley. I really don't think that
                        a solution on these lines is impossible. It may be wise incidentally when
                        the time comes to have the British do it as a Commonwealth exercise.</p>
                    <p>With the great advantage of perspective, I regard the election results as a
                        strong endorsement of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>

                    <p>On November 14, 1962, the Governments of the United States and India
                        exchanged diplomatic notes, signed in Washington, which established a formal
                        basis for the military assistance which the United States had been providing
                        to India since November 3. The U.S. note, signed by Assistant Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Phillips Talbot</persName>, indicated that
                        the purpose of the assistance was to lend to the defense of India against
                        “outright Chinese aggression.” The only other conditions attached to the
                        offer were that U.S. representatives in India be permitted to observe the
                        use of the military supplies provided and that any excess supplies be
                        returned when no longer needed for the purposes for which they had been
                        supplied. The Indian note, signed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1"
                            >B. K. Nehru</persName>, confirmed the agreement outlined in the U.S.
                        note. The texts of the notes are printed in Department of State Bulletin,
                        December 3, 1962, page 838.</p>

                            we agree with the British and, to the extent that we can get them to
                            contribute, other Commonwealth countries, to equip a force of about five
                            divisions and their supporting formations. A preliminary guess is that
                            the equipment involved might cost as much as $50 million. The associated
                            supplies, especially ammunition, might be equally or more expensive
                            depending on Indian production capabilities and present Indian stocks,
                            neither of which are well known at the moment.</item>

                        <item>The rationale of the program is that, with such assistance, the
                            Indians would be capable of holding the Chinese where they are now. If
                            the Indians wish to reconquer the Chinese-occupied area, they would have
                            to use half to two-thirds of the forces they now have on their border
                            with Pakistan (see Tab 2).<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">The document
                                attached at Tab 2, dated November 16, consists of a 1-page

                            aid to the Indians with a continuation of pressure on them to improve

                                facs="0413"/>memorandum is a cautious one. It certainly makes sense
                            as a first step, until events reveal more clearly what Chinese
                            intentions are and how relations within the sub-continent will shift.
                            Still, it is important to take a longer look ahead. Do we want to push
                            the Indians hard enough and give them enough help to make sure that they
                            do not seek a negotiated solution on Chinese terms and lapse back into
                            neutralism? Continuance of the war may serve important U.S. policy
                            objectives: the sharp decline of “positive neutralism” as a foreign
                            policy stance in the unaligned countries, greatly improved relations
                            between India and Pakistan, another setback to Chinese Communist
                            prestige and power with consequences felt throughout Asia. On the other
                            hand, continuance of the war may be increasingly at our expense. Can we
                            and do we wish to bear the costs? Alternatively, it may well be beyond
                            our power to promote a continuance of the war. The direct reaction of
                            the Indians when confronted with the costs of reconquering what they
                            have already lost may lead them to draw back no matter what we do. The
                            effects on Pakistan of our aid to India may continue to be so
                            unfavorable as to become a limiting factor in what we can do. It is
                            neither necessary nor possible to answer these questions now. However,
                            we must certainly begin to consider them and the policy decision we take
                            on the narrower issue which will be before you on Monday is at best an
                            interim one.</item>

                            confidential relationship with the United States. Sophisticated concern

                        Deeply appreciate your handling present crisis. I am convinced that we are
                        on the front edge of large and unpredictable events affecting many parts of
                        the world and that earlier frames of reference will require radical review
                        by many governments including our own.</p>
                    <p>I wish to underline fourth numbered recommendation Urtel 1853. India's
                        relation with Pakistan is now a central problem for India affecting its own
                        vital security and national existence. India must understand the limits upon
                        our capacity to influence Karachi. We ourselves cannot prevent a
                        Pakistan-Peiping side deal and a withdrawal of Pakistan from <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> if Pakistan becomes determined, however irrationally and
                        recklessly, to pursue that course. Delhi would not be the first capital to
                        make the mistake of believing that we have unlimited powers of persuasion in
                        every capital other than its own.</p>
                    <p>If the situation in the subcontinent should take a rapid and adverse turn,
                        India must surely recognize that geography restricts our own capacity to act
                        promptly in the area. Further if Pakistan breaks its Western ties and
                        conspires with Peiping against India it would be crucially important for the
                        American people to know that India has taken every possible step to avoid
                        that result. Otherwise our ability to help India would be severely
                        circumscribed.</p>
                    <p>I am not arguing Pakistan's case nor condoning her effort to extort maximum
                        advantage from India's danger. I am emphasizing utter seriousness <pb

                        themselves into near hysterical state and that next few weeks will be very

                        frighten U.S. and force us into certain actions vis-a-vis India. We must,
                        therefore, avoid appearance of over concern and avoid being whiplashed. For
                        example, we must give no encouragement to <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> that we will provide additional military assistance to

                            n="1" xml:id="d202fn1">The text of the U.S.-U.K. memorandum of
                            understanding concerning the Sino-Indian conflict was transmitted in
                            telegram 1865 from London, November 14. It is summarized in Document
                            198. A copy of the memorandum of understanding is attached to a November
                            19 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, recommending the

                            subject to some minor suggested changes in language. (Kennedy Library,

                            11/19/62)</note> prepared during the London meetings, <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested it seemed overtaken by
                        events. The situation was already getting to a point where we and others
                        could no longer act as if it were normal. He agreed that the Commonwealth
                        ought to be moving faster. We were already supporting most of the countries
                        around the Communist Asian periphery, hence there was some advantage to the
                        Commonwealth taking the lead in helping India while we trailed somewhat
                        behind.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> urged that the first move be
                        to find out what the real situation was. If we were to put our prestige and
                        resources at risk, we must find out the score. He proposed sending a small
                        high-level military mission immediately to Delhi. He doubted that the
                        Indians were asking for enough, but felt that we couldn't appraise their
                        plans without detailed knowledge. Hence the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> should select 10-15 officers to go out to size up the
                        situation. They could be ready in 2-3 days.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> queried whether strategic and
                        technical advice shouldn't come from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        in the first instance, but <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        doubted whether this would come soon enough. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> acknowledged that the Assam Valley could be in <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> hands within a week and urged that
                        transport aircraft be sent soonest because they would be needed in any case.
                        We needed to get some C-130s on the way while we were making a more
                        systematic evaluation. Otherwise, the Indians might get kicked out of Assam.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> argued that doing so would
                        help deter the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s by signaling that
                        we would get involved in a big way if this happened. There was also some
                        discussion of the Indian need for spare parts for their C-119s.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that we should ask <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName> about Commonwealth plans, what they could do about
                        Australian and other wheat to Communist China and what military missions the
                        Commonwealth might be planning to send out (he had Ormsby Gore called over
                        to meet with him and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>).</p>
                    <p>At the President's request, <persName corresp="#p_GJP1">Grant</persName>
                        explained the rationale behind the US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        recommendations, particularly the five-division package. It was impossible
                        to say what share the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would take.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doubted that the
                        British would be willing to go 50-50 on any such substantial <pb n="396"
                            xml:id="pg_396" facs="0422"/>amount. The President agreed that the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> ought to take the lead. This wouldn't
                        last long, but we ought to start them up in front.</p>
                    <p>There was discussion of whether Sino-Indian negotiations were likely.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we suspected
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> was still hoping for some kind of a deal. We
                        were aware he had proposed one involving a Chinese return to the November
                        1959 line and an Indian return to the 8 September 1962 line. This might be
                        why <persName>Nehru</persName> hadn't declared war.</p>
                    <p>The subject of Pakistani reactions was also discussed. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> indicated that there could be a wide
                        swing in Pakistani attitudes if Assam was really threatened.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> again urged getting a high
                        level mission out to Delhi, including State and Intelligence people in order
                        to concert a plan of action with the Indians. We needed a mission on the
                        lines of the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mission to
                        Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> preferred to see the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> take the lead on this mission, with us
                        participating if desirable, rather than a straight US mission. It was
                        pointed out that the more we got in front the more we would push Moscow
                        toward Peiping.</p>
                    <p>The President decided that we should: (1) get a mission off to Delhi; (2)
                        send some C-130s; (3) take care of the C-119 spare parts; and (4) push the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to get the Commonwealth in, and decide
                        what we want to tell <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> showed the President a proposed press conference
                        statement for Tuesday, indicating language which we had used previously in
                        the Cabot-Wang talks to indicate to Peiping that we meant business. The
                        President decided we ought to review the proposed press conference statement
                        and put the Western response on a broader basis than that of the US alone.
                        We should push the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to get the Commonwealth
                        involved.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> couldn't understand why the
                        Indians didn't use air. They could certainly tear up the Chicom roads.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of the desirability of using Tibetan
                        guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>Talbot reminded the President of the “gentleman's agreement” limiting <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 aid to India. <persName corresp="#p_GWS1"
                            >Gaud</persName> explained that in the light of new <gloss
                            target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 needs we would run afoul of this
                        agreement if we spent more than $25 million on military aid to India. The
                        President preferred not to go to the congressional committee yet; however,
                        he told <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> to bring Senator
                        Symington up to date.</p>

                    <p>[The letter conveyed in telegram 1891 was the first of two letters sent by
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> on November 19. The second was delivered to the
                        White House by the Indian Ambassador on the evening of November 19. The text
                        of that letter was transmitted to the Embassy in New Delhi in telegram 2167,
                        November 19. These letters have not been declassified by the Indian
                        Government. In his biography of <persName>Nehru</persName>, Gopal summarized
                        these two letters as follows:</p>
                    <p>[”<persName>Nehru</persName>, apparently without consulting any of his
                        Cabinet colleagues or officials, apart from the Foreign Secretary, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J. Desai</persName>, wrote two letters to <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> describing the situation as 'really
                        desperate' and requesting the immediate despatch of a minimum of twelve
                        squadrons of supersonic all-weather fighters and the setting up of radar
                        communications. American personnel would have to man these fighters and
                        installations and protect Indian cities from air attacks by the Chinese till
                        India personnel had been trained. If possible, the United States should also
                        send planes flown by American personnel to assist the Indian Air Force in
                        any battles with the Chinese in Indian air space; but aerial action by
                        Indian elsewhere would be the responsibility of the Indian Air Force.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> also asked for two B-47 bomber squadrons to
                        enable India to strike at Chinese bases and air fields, but to learn to fly
                        these planes Indian pilots and technicians would be sent immediately for
                        training in the United States. All such assistance and equipment would be
                        utilized solely against the Chinese.” (Gopal, <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"

                    <p>2172. Eyes Only for Ambassador from Secretary. We have just forwarded to you
                        second letter from <persName>Nehru</persName> today anticipated in your
                            1889.<note n="1" xml:id="d206fn1">Dated November 19. (Ibid.,
                            691.93/11-1962) [Regarding <persName>Nehru</persName>'s letter, see <ref
                                target="#d203">Documents 203</ref> and <ref target="#d204"
                            >204</ref>.]</note> As we read this message it amounts to a request for
                        an active and practically speaking unlimited military partnership between
                        the United States and India to take on Chinese invasion India. This involves
                        for us the most far-reaching political and strategic issues and we are not
                        at all convinced that Indians are prepared to face the situation in the same
                        terms. I recall that more than once in past two years I have expressed to
                        various Indian representatives my concern that their policy would lead to a
                        situation where they would call upon us for assistance when it is too late
                        rather than give their and free world policy any opportunity for preventive
                        effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>It is not our purpose now to rehash the past but to look at present situation
                        in its fullest reality. The essential question is whether Peiping is now
                        engaged in an all-out assault on India or is pushing its territorial claims
                        up to the extreme limits of Chinese pretentions.
                        <persName>Nehru</persName>'s latest message indicates his assessment that
                        the Chinese are determined to push far beyond disputed areas and that this
                        is in fact a genuine attack on India.</p>
                    <p>If this is so then it is apparent that India is faced with the necessity of
                        mobilizing every possible resource in its support and that every other
                        question must be subordinated to its own defense and national existence. It
                        seems that, therefore, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> must now
                        consider maximum diplomatic, political and military effort to encompass the
                        following:</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>(1)</label>
                        <item>The enlistment of full Pakistani cooperation at whatever cost in terms
                            of lesser question between the two countries including Kashmir. The
                            United States cannot give maximum military support to India while most
                            of India's forces are engaged against Pakistan over an issue where
                            American interest in self-determination of the peoples directly
                            concerned has caused us since 1954 to be sympathetic to Pakistan's
                            claims. To put it in most brutal terms, India may now face a choice
                            between Pakistani assistance in the defense of India and some kind of
                            satisfaction of Pakistan's interest in the Kashmir question.</item>
                        <label>(2)</label>
                        <item>We have seen little evidence thus far of India's attempt to mobilize
                            the traditional commitments of the British Commonwealth. We <pb n="401"
                                xml:id="pg_401" facs="0427"/>believe the defense of India is in the
                            first instance a Commonwealth problem though there are no formal treaty
                            commitments within that structure. If India considers that it is faced
                            with a war against China, it would be very difficult for the United
                            States to give maximum assistance without the fullest participation of
                            at least the old Commonwealth and without the elimination of such
                            anomalies as normal Commonwealth relations with Peiping and the shipment
                            of large supplies of foodstuffs from Canada and Australia to Red China.
                            India must, we think, insist upon maximum Commonwealth support in its
                            struggle against China. Specifically, any requests for assistance made
                            of us should also be addressed to the British.</item>
                        <label>(3)</label>
                        <item>A third factor is the United Nations. We can understand that
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> might have been reluctant to raise
                            question of Chinese aggression in United Nations so long as he had any
                            hope that Russia would not be forced to support Peiping. On the other
                            hand, the full mobilization of world opinion against Red China could
                            bring to bear political, economic and psychological pressures on Peiping
                            which would add strength to the relative ineffectiveness thus far of
                            Indian arms. In any event, full United States support for India would be
                            much easier and more palatable to the American people if there were near
                            unanimity in the United Nations that this was an aggression rejected by
                            the entire world community, and on which India had the widest possible
                            international support.</item>
                        <label>(4)</label>
                        <item>Further, we have seen little evidence that India has attempted to
                            mobilize the political and practical support of other nations in
                            southern and Southeast Asia also bordering on or near Red China and
                            interested in resistance to Red Chinese expansion. India's heretofore
                            cavalier attitude toward communist penetration Southeast Asia is
                            obviously an obstacle to Asian solidarity in this situation, but a
                            maximum diplomatic effort to trade support for support with these
                            countries is clearly called for.</item>

                            effect proposes not only a military alliance between India and the

                            any further pretense of non-alignment. If this is what
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> has in mind, he should be entirely clear

                    <p>There are strong reasons why the United States should not appear to be the
                        point of the spear in assisting India in this situation. The most impelling
                        of these is that our role might force Moscow to support Peiping. We shall be
                        considering here whether there is anything we can constructively say to
                        Moscow about China's reckless and provocative action because there is some
                        reason to believe that Moscow is also very much worried about the dangerous
                        possibility. I would emphasize, however, <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402"
                            facs="0428"/>India must mobilize its own diplomatic and political
                        resources, seek the broadest base of support throughout the world and, more
                        particularly, enlist the active interest and participation of the

                    <p>Without directly accusing Government of holding such notions, I hit very hard
                        at view that military aid would continue if Pakistanis left regional

                            >Mohammed Ali</persName> but do not feel we are by any means out of
                        woods here. <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed Ali</persName> may not

                        some sober second thoughts.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest in conversation with <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz

                            established. Provided the Indian Government took corresponding measures,
                            China was prepared to enter into negotiations with India to seek a
                            resolution of the conflict. (The New York Times, November 21,

                        Messages from New Delhi show your watchfulness on the matter but I want to
                        emphasize again that I think it is important that we neither push the
                        Indians forward nor hold them back in the present phase. We do not wish to
                        be responsible either for war or for truce. We should be ready to cooperate
                        with them, subject to obvious limits of our capabilities, in whatever course
                        they choose, but it must be for them to make the choices. Obviously we
                        should not hesitate to give advice against more obvious forms of political
                        or military rashness and our calmness should be a counterpoise to shaken
                        Indian confidence. But we cannot allow them to put off on us the basic
                        responsibilities which must remain Indian.<note n="1" xml:id="d210fn1">In

                        your stopover in <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0432"/>Pakistan is to
                        inform <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> generally on your Delhi
                        talks, I also regard it as a major opportunity to show <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> how radically the Sino-Indian
                        confrontation has altered the situation in the subcontinent from our point
                        of view. We have had to look at this situation in terms of Free World
                        security and we regard it as a major test of our alliance ties as well as
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s statesmanship whether he
                        does so too.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time we have been prepared to disregard as much as possible a
                        basic difference in viewpoint between us and the Pakistani as to what our
                        alliance meant. They have always regarded it primarily as a basis for
                        soliciting support of their aims vis-a-vis India. We have regarded it as
                        part of the total free world defense against Bloc aggression, a contingency
                        that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> seems to have regarded as
                        remote. Now that it has actually occurred, however, it must take precedence
                        in our thinking. It ought to do so in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        and Indian thinking too. As and when this sinks in, our task of promoting
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Indian reconciliation will grow
                        easier.</p>
                    <p>Regrettably, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has elected instead
                        to pursue at least initially a tough line toward India and, for obvious
                        reasons, toward us. Though I recognize that he is under some domestic
                        pressure, at a moment like this there are limits on how far we can live with
                        this attitude. Whether the present Sino-Indian crisis ends in a negotiated
                        settlement or continues to boil, the Indians will almost certainly wish to
                        undertake a major modernization of their forces. We shall be pressed to
                        become the chief underwriter and cannot sustain the additional costs
                        implicit in continued <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Indian quarrels.
                        These costs have already been great enough.</p>
                    <p>I also believe that the Sino-Indian confrontation has given us what may be a
                        one-time opportunity to bring about a <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                        >Pak</gloss>-Indian reconciliation. Though this opportunity may be fleeting,
                        we still ought to seize it if we can. Success will require movement in both
                        the Pakistani and Indian positions. Yet unless both Pakistan and India look
                        clearly at their fundamental interest in partnership this opportunity may be
                        lost. We cannot expect quick results, but can hope to set in motion a trend
                        which will bring about, with a lot of nursing along from us, a resolution of
                        such issues as Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>I do not want to push <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> so hard as
                        to get his back up, yet I think it imperative that he be under no illusion
                        as to where we stand. Frank talk carries risks, but these seem to me less
                        than those entailed in failing to make our position clear. I count on you to
                        do so. Therefore, while you and <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName> will of course choose the manner of your
                        presentation, please tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that I
                        have specifically asked you to make the following points to him: <list>

                                Pakistan, which India is beginning to acknowledge. It provides a

                                seeking to cope with it, we intend to provide help to meet that

                            <item>Were Pakistan to move closer to the Chinese at a time when we were
                                assisting India to confront Communist China, it would cut across the
                                deep commitments of the entire free world. We know <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has no illusions about the
                                    <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s, but we would regard
                                such gestures as wholly incompatible with Pakistan's own interests,
                                traditions, and commitments. Pakistan must realize that there are
                                certain limits which should not be overstepped if a fruitful <gloss

                                taking casualties every week. The esteem and friendship of the
                                American people for Pakistan would melt away if Pakistan elects to

                            <item>Indeed we think the opposite course from that which Ayub pursuing
                                publicly is far better calculated to lead to the resolution of

                                and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> seek. The more
                                forthcoming Pakistan is toward India, the harder it will be for
                                India to avoid movement in its direction. By the same token, the

                                Thus the current <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> attitude risks
                                diverting India from primary focus on the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"

                    <p>On arrival in Rawalpindi (November 28, 5:00 p.m.) I was informed by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> wanted me to dine with him
                        and <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> alone and that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> wanted to see me half an
                        hour before dinner in order to bring me up to date on what transpired.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> told me that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> had informed President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s willingness to start discussions regarding
                        Kashmir without preconditions on any level; <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> was proposing that first a preliminary meeting be
                        held between <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> at New Delhi, since it was <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s turn to go to the Indian capital.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> wanted to talk to me
                        before making up his mind.</p>
                    <p>In my discussion with <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> before
                        dinner, he argued for a President-Prime Minister meeting, and I told him
                        that I would think it wise to hold such a meeting only if the communique to
                        be issued at the end of the meeting be agreed to in advance. Without such an
                        agreement it would be dangerous since <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName> found it difficult to
                        negotiate due to the difference in the personalities of the two men.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> bought this idea. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> and I then drove to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s house and had a long talk
                        with him before going into dinner. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> produced a draft communique announcing a meeting
                        between the President and the Prime Minister in New Delhi, including a
                        sentence to the effect that the objective of the meeting would be to decide
                        on methods and procedure to settle the differences between their two
                        countries. I then outlined my thought of an agreement in advance on the
                        final communique to be issued at the close of the meeting. After some
                        discussion, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said if we are to
                        agree upon a communique at the end of the discussions, why have a meeting at
                        all—why not agree now on that communique by correspondence between himself
                        and <persName>Nehru</persName>? I readily accepted this and so did <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>. Taking the first sentence of
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>' paper, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> dictated, with some discussion of each
                        sentence, the following communique to be issued:</p>
                    <p>The President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India have agreed that
                        renewed effort should be made without delay to resolve the Kashmir problem
                        so as to enable their two countries to live side by side free from
                        anxiety.</p>
                    <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0436"/>
                    <p>In consequence, they have decided to open negotiations at an early date with
                        the object of reaching an honorable and equitable settlement.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations will be conducted initially at the ministerial level. At the
                        appropriate stage direct talks will be held between Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> agreed to take this draft to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, attempt to get his approval and signature,
                        and bring it back to Rawalpindi for President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s signature. We all hoped that it might be possible to
                        issue the communique on Friday morning.<note n="1" xml:id="d212fn1"
                                ><persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> returned to New Delhi
                            on November 29 to discuss the text of the proposed joint statement with
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>. <persName>Nehru</persName> accepted the
                            statement, conditional upon one substantive change. He requested that
                            the first paragraph be amended: change “to resolve the Kashmir problem”
                            to read “to resolve the outstanding differences between their two
                            countries on Kashmir and other matters.” (Telegram 2158 from New Delhi,
                            November 29; ibid., 690D.91/11-2962) With the alteration of “other
                            matters” to read “other related matters,” <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> accepted the proposed change and the joint
                            communique was released on Friday, November 30. (Telegram 964 from
                            Karachi, November 29; ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>While the draft communique was being retyped, we had a discussion ranging
                        over a wide area. In answer to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                        questions, <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> and I expressed our
                        views of the climate of opinion in India on the possibility of reaching a
                        settlement on Kashmir. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>
                        expressed himself somewhat more optimistically than I did. I explained that
                        I had been struck by the unity of purpose which had developed in India in
                        recognizing the long-range danger of Chinese Communist aggression. Domestic
                        difficulties were being put aside by the people all over the country. In the
                        villages people were enlisting, contributing funds, and asking what they
                        could do to help in this national emergency. I explained I had found that
                        everyone with whom I had talked, unanimously spoke of the emergency in
                        long-range terms. It was therefore natural that the minds of many were
                        turned towards the importance of settling differences with Pakistan so that
                        their entire energy could be directed towards the Communist menace. I told
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that I thought some
                        further time would be needed to get all the Ministers, as well as public
                        opinion, in a mood to make a reasonable settlement but that I felt the time
                        was running in the right direction and that it was essential to start
                        negotiations which in themselves would focus public opinion on the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> insisted that Kashmir be named as
                        the problem. He rejected the idea of a vaguer reference to “differences
                        between the two countries.” Both <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> and I made it plain that it would be impossible to
                        have a plebiscite, that the Vale as such could not be transferred to
                        Pakistan, but that there was an understanding in India that they had to make
                        certain concessions beyond the present cease-fire line. We both told him we
                        had not discussed details and did not know how far the India Government was
                        ready to go at the present time. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        accepted this situation and recognized that the negotiations on Kashmir
                        might last a considerable time, <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0437"/>but
                        under the formula it was proposed in the communique there was considerable
                        flexibility of continuing discussions even though the first talks might not
                        reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                    <p>We discussed Chinese intentions. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        said he believed that their intentions were only to insure control of the
                        Sinkiang road and a certain part of Ladakh. I pointed out that this might be
                        their immediate objective but that they did not have to attack in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> area in order to achieve this objective.
                        I underlined the opinion of all the Indians I had talked to that Red China
                        was determined to destroy India's independence and way of life. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> did not contradict this and talked as
                        if he recognized the long-range menace of Red China to the subcontinent.
                        There was no suggestion of a non-aggression pact between Pakistan and Red
                        China.</p>
                    <p>We discussed Khrushchev's motives in Cuba. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> expressed great admiration for the
                        manner in which President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        handled the Cuban question.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he believed the
                        differences between Moscow and Peiping were real but that if Red China got
                        into military difficulties, the Soviet Union would come to her assistance.
                        There seemed to be no intimation that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> thought that Pakistan could make a special deal and
                        thus avoid the dangers of either Soviet or Chinese Communist aggressive
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>We discussed at some length the relationship between
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> with general agreement that <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> had spoken for
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>. I believe that <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> and I convinced <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> was out for good, that <persName>Nehru</persName> did
                        not have, any longer, the unchallenged authority to bring him back.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> and I touched on the military
                        situation in India but did not go into details as I explained that General
                        Adams was here to brief President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> the next morning, although we did give some indication
                        of the size of British and American assistance so far. At dinner President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> reverted to the subject of
                        our military assistance, turning to me and saying, “Now tell me about this
                        assistance you are giving to India.” I gave him the general order of
                        dimensions emphasizing that the loss of the equipment by the Fourth Division
                        alone was far in excess in anything we had delivered or had agreed to
                        deliver so far. I pointed out, however, that India had plans for long-range
                        military build-up which the Government was now determined to undertake in
                        order that they would not be helpless against Communist attack in the
                        future. We left it that we would discuss this subject in more detail the
                        next day. In answer to my question Ayub told me of the commencement of the
                        de-salinization program. He expressed hopes that it would be successful,
                        although it would take a long time. He talked about his visit to the Hunza
                        area and he expressed the hope that he could come to an agreement with
                        Peiping over the boundary but would insist on retaining the Hunza grazing
                        areas.</p>
                    <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0438"/>
                    <p>At one point, touching on Khrushchev's desire to avoid nuclear war, he said,
                        “Yes, I know your views. I read your book which you had sent to me.” He did
                        not, however, take issue with this statement and agreed that at the present
                        time Red China was more reckless. Cuba had been proof of Khrushchev's
                        brinkmanship methods, leaving open always an opportunity to withdraw.</p>
                    <p>He spoke warmly of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        and with satisfaction of his visit to Washington. He pointed to a framed
                        photograph on the wall.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSK1">Dehlavi</persName> was present throughout the
                        evening but rarely injected himself in the discussion except at one point he
                        mentioned that they had received an offer from Turkey to undertake mediation
                        on Kashmir. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> pointed out that a
                        Turkish offer would not go very well in New Delhi. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> discussed at some length his
                        difficulties with <persName>Nehru</persName>. He mentioned that when a
                        subject came up which <persName>Nehru</persName> did not wish to discuss, he
                        simply sat silent, which President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> said was most disconcerting. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> asked about the Soviet <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>S. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> said that the Soviet Union had declined to furnish
                        them. I said that my information maintained that they had postponed
                        delivery, attempting to straddle the relationship (their “friend” India and
                        their “ally” China).</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was cordial throughout
                        the evening, relaxed, showed no strain or scars from the debate in the
                        Assembly in the statements of the opposition.</p>
                    <p>I did not raise any of the other subjects I have in mind discussing, as I
                        felt it was desirable to concentrate on the commencement of negotiations
                        over Kashmir. He may well become more perturbed when we get into some of the
                        questions about which he has been critical of U.S. policy and actions.</p>

                    <p>I called on President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> alone
                        Thursday afternoon, November 29, at 6:00 p.m. at his Residence. He asked if
                        I objected to his bringing in his secretary (namely <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSK1">Dehlavi</persName>, the Foreign Secretary).</p>
                    <p>I replied that I did since I wanted to talk personally.</p>
                    <p>I started in by asking him whether he was concerned over his political
                        position now that he had instituted the constitutional procedures. He
                        replied that he was not. He could count on over 80 votes out of 156
                        membership in the Assembly. He could not act as freely as before, and it
                        would take him longer to get things done. He commented that this was in the
                        direction of democratic processes that we believe in. We must not expect too
                        rapid development of democracy as in the East people didn't understand it.
                        In reply to my question he said the opposition was largely self-serving
                        politicians. I told him that the President and Secretary of State wanted to
                        do all we could to help strengthen his position and asked what we might
                        do.</p>
                    <p>He replied three things: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>Use our influence to get a Kashmir settlement.</item>

                            <item>Don't press him for disengagement with India in the
                                meantime.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>Go slow on urging joint defense of subcontinent. This would come
                                automatically with the Kashmir settlement.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>In answer to my question on what I might say helpfully to the press, he
                        suggested I say “Circumstances force us to give military aid to India but
                        emphasize that Pakistan is our close friend and ally. We realize Kashmir is
                        Pakistan's major problem.” I suggested that I might add that since the
                        attack of Red China more and more people in India were beginning to realize
                        the necessity of a Kashmir settlement. It was interesting that he suggested
                        that I use the words “under the changed circumstances more and more people,”
                        etc. He obviously did not want me to refer to Red Chinese aggression.</p>
                    <p>I underlined the damage that the talk about non-aggression pact was to
                        Pakistan's good will in the U.S. He said to pay no attention to such <pb
                            n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0440"/>talk, it was unthinkable for him to
                        do such a thing. (Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammad
                            Ali</persName> confirmed this when I saw him on Friday.)</p>
                    <p>I still maintained it was dangerous to permit such speculation. Such talk
                        could irreparably damage confidence in Pakistan's responsibility as an ally.
                        He and his country were now considered one of staunchest and steadfast
                        friends. This was an asset not lightly to be thrown away. I also referred to
                        the anti-American press and Assembly speeches. He belittled these, said he
                        had to allow free discussion, and referred to our freedom of press. I urged
                        him not to let it get out of hand as he might become a prisoner of the
                        public opinion that was being developed.</p>
                    <p>At that moment (6:35 p.m.) a message was brought in from the British High
                        Commissioner, Sir <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">Morrice James</persName>, that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had accepted the word “related” between
                        “other … matters.” I said that I thought President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had been wise in holding out for
                        “related” matters. This was a first test of <persName>Nehru</persName>'s
                        sincerity in starting discussions.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> came in and there were mutual
                        congratulations. I commented that this was a good start but only a start.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> replied that he understood
                        that but was counting on our help in getting a fair settlement. He said he
                        understood that any fair settlement would be unpopular in both
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>After <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> left, I asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> if there was any particular subject in
                        connection with U.S. aid that he wanted me to look into when I got back to
                        Washington. He thought for a minute and said he couldn't think of anything,
                        although some of our people were unnecessarily suspicious and slow in taking
                        action. He said he wanted me to see his Planning Commissioner, Said Hassan,
                        when I got to Karachi. In taking my leave he asked me to give the President
                        his warmest regards. He expressed the highest admiration for the manner in
                        which the President had handled the Cuban crisis.</p>

                        he would accept McMahon line de facto and Chou's later denial of statement;
                        Chou's 1956 offer trade <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> status quo for

                            <persName>Nehru</persName> rejected; unproductive talks by officials
                        following <persName>Nehru</persName>'s rejection Chou's offer.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> observed that Aksai Chin and road valuable to
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s but rest Ladakh had no value.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked whether India had
                        ever made offer to <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s on that corner
                        Ladakh. <persName>Nehru</persName> said no, explained his offer of mutual
                        withdrawal to line claimed by other side after which India prepared let
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s use road for civil purposes;
                        said this offer repeated May 1962. <persName>Nehru</persName> emphasized
                        India in undisputed possession <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> for 50
                        years whatever <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s said about legal
                        basis McMahon line. <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss> attack in
                            <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> obviously required long
                        preparation. <persName>Nehru</persName> several times said <gloss

                        attack followed by November 21 cease fire. <persName>Nehru</persName> said

                        asked whether there had been any actual withdrawals yet.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> said there had; <persName>Desai</persName>

                        offer had previously been rejected. Ambassador asked about other
                        possibilities, noting that <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had

                        advance further after some interval. <persName>Nehru</persName> mentioned
                        difficult situation created by Brahmaputra river strike in East Pakistan and
                        its effects on tea exports.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked whether

                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and if so what would he say.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> said he obviously had to answer. In three or
                        four days he would say something and raise various objections. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Ambassador referred to public
                        presentation Indian case and importance of making reasonable counter offer
                        to put onus on <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s. At moment <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s look reasonable and this advantage
                        had to be taken away from them. <persName>Desai</persName> reviewed <gloss

                        his preliminary view that it would take at least until end of next year for

                    <p>Second <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> meeting with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> alone November 25 was for primary purpose
                        discussing India-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations and
                        possibility of Kashmir settlement. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> explained there two aspects: 1) immediate problem
                        of calming <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s from their emotional binge against India
                        and US and pro-China; 2) long-run problem of defense of subcontinent; said
                        unless tensions relieved US position untenable if it was asked give aid both
                        Pakistan and India with part of aid being used for defense against the
                        other. In response first point <persName>Nehru</persName> said he could not
                        make further gesture towards <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. He
                        had written letter he considered cordial and had had no reply. In addition,
                        India had been humiliated by <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                        attack and public opinion would not stand for further humiliation in making
                        concessions to Pakistan. When pressed on this point
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> went into considerable detail on history
                        negotiations with Pakistan over Kashmir and constant failure reach agreement
                        on any basis acceptable to India. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        were now to make concessions public would not stand for it. In fact it might
                        touch off violent communal rioting endangering lives of 40 million Indian
                        Muslims. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said number of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s colleagues indicated they thought time
                        right for settlement. Discussion at some length followed on possible basis
                        for settlement. <persName>Nehru</persName> rejected giving half to Pakistan
                        or independent status for Kashmir but agreed some arrangements such as those
                        proposed by <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J. Desai</persName> and Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> might be acceptable.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pressed
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> on immediate importance relieving tensions
                        and suggested discussions might begin between two governments. At first
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> rejected this on grounds that if discussions
                        failed it would make situation even worse. He finally agreed that if
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> were willing he would join
                        in starting negotiations preferably on Ministerial level.</p>
                    <p><persName>Nehru</persName> indicated that present not best time for
                        settlement from standpoint Indian opinion but agreed that more favorable
                        climate might develop. This climate might be encouraged if <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and his colleagues would make some
                        friendly gesture towards India to offset torrent of <pb n="417"

                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        think over situation and expressed hope <persName>Nehru</persName> could arm

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> raised subject
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s request to President for air assistance.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> said he not pressing matter now as he did not
                        believe <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would attack at least for
                        some months. He thought <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s wanted

                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said our military were
                        discussing air assistance request with British and Indian Air Force. If
                        anything to be provided Commonwealth countries should come in first.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> explained subject being
                        discussed without commitment.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> told
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan
                            Sandys</persName> had been informed by <persName corresp="#p_DM1"
                            >Morarji Desai</persName> that Soviets had definitely declined supply
                            <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s. <persName>Nehru</persName> replied
                        that <persName>Desai</persName> could not have had latest information and
                        what he had told <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> must have been
                        based on earlier talk by Indian Ambassador Moscow with a Soviet Deputy
                        Commissar of Foreign Affairs. Recently Khrushchev assured Indian Ambassador
                        that <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> factory would be delivered in

                            <persName>Nehru</persName> gave impression he trying minimize importance
                        of matter. Meeting lasted little less than hour. At parting
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> again for US aid and promptness of US response to

                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and Ambassador stressed to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s domestic difficulties and
                        urged it in India's interest work out settlement with <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. Also pointed out to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> necessity of devising formula that would help
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> domestically and strengthen
                        him against his critics there. <persName>Nehru</persName> said he amenable
                        talks but indicated he had very limited concept in mind such as adjustment
                        cease fire line. Ambassador said this not enough. By end of talks
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> agreed he willing enter talks with open mind
                        and without pre-conditions. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                        impression of last meeting was that <persName>Nehru</persName> had become

                        involves the re-equipping of three divisions and setting up three additional
                        divisions so the Indians would have a total of 16 divisions, 15 regular plus

                    <p>With reference to the Soviet position and a question from the President,
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> advised that apparently
                        the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal was off though
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had stated it had merely been postponed.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> seemed intent on maintaining a relationship
                        with the Soviets. There were no indications that the Soviets have intervened
                        to stop the Chinese Communists; on the other hand Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reached the conclusion that the
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had only limited objectives
                        which they had accomplished and that they did not at this time intend to
                        attempt conquest of the Assam Plain. It is quite possible their objectives
                        might be extended in the future but only after further preparation on their
                        part.</p>

                        costs of the initial phase are to be divided, but the agreement calls for
                        each side to supply the equipment which it is best equipped to supply. The
                        British have agreed on 10 million pounds and may add another 5 million
                        pounds. The Canadians and Australians have indicated modest help. <persName

                        stating that it might require between 120 and 150 million dollars from the
                        United States. The President expressed the belief that we should split on a
                        50-50 basis with the Commonwealth. A subcommittee was appointed to work out
                        details.</p>

                    <p>2988. Eyes Only Ambassador Bruce. For your information, the following message
                        from President has been sent to Prime Minister via other channels.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>You will by now have heard from your mission to India and Pakistan, as I have
                        from mine. The success of their endeavors was far beyond my expectations.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName>' effort in getting
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> to make public a statement of their desire to negotiate
                        the Kashmir issue was a fine stroke. Having done so much, I think we must do
                        more to follow up on our initial successes. As leader of the Commonwealth, I
                        think you may well be in a position to provide the continuing push on
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> that will be required to keep the negotiations going
                        with any prospect of a successful conclusion. I see advantages in having
                        someone at a high level specially concerned with this task who can move
                        freely between Delhi and Karachi in a way that your high commissioners and
                        my ambassadors cannot, and yet is not in any formal way a mediator. I would
                        appreciate your thoughts on the possibility of your finding a suitable
                        person to assign to the task.</p>
                    <p>The time has come when we have to give some thought to putting our military
                        assistance arrangements with India on a more formal basis. Our own thinking
                        runs somewhat along the following lines. We are still in the emergency phase
                        which the original agreement that your people and mine negotiated in London
                        on Nov. 14 was intended to cover. While the character of emergency has
                        changed, I think it is still desirable to build up the Indian forces to the
                        extent possible within the next two or three months. After that, we will
                        enter a phase of longer-run assistance where we must consider carefully the
                        political implications of what we do. Before we embark on this program, we
                        must get clear in our minds both a judgment of the Indian military
                        requirements and a view of the relation between our assistance and the
                        advance of India and Pakistan toward a settlement of the Kashmir dispute. A
                        more exact judgment on these matters must await a detailed examination of
                        Indian army requirements and plans which our military people brought home.
                        As far as the first, or emergency phase, goes I have come to the conclusion
                        that we should stand ready to offer as much as $60 million worth of
                        assistance, <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0446"/>including what we have
                        already shipped. I hope that you and the Commonwealth countries will be
                        prepared to operate with a similar ceiling, and that we can act so as to
                        share the burden roughly equally between us.</p>
                    <p>A final problem to which I think we must give the closest attention is the
                        question of Indian air defense. It is clear that the Indians are extremely
                        fearful of the possibility of Chinese air attack on their cities. This fear
                        has inhibited them from using their own air force in the tactical support of
                        their armies. My military men estimate that the removal of this inhibition
                        would contribute greatly to the Indian ability to resist a renewed Chinese
                        attack. In view of the great expense and the long interval of the time
                        required to provide the Indians with their own air defense capability, as
                        well as the possible repercussions in Pakistan, it seems to me that we would
                        do well to consider the extent to which we could agree to provide a certain
                        amount of air defense operated by our own forces should the Indians need it.
                        I would suggest that we undertake to provide the radar and other ground
                        equipment necessary while you and some of the Commonwealth countries accept
                        the commitment to send an appropriate number of fighter squadrons to India
                        should the need arise. This is obviously a matter which will require some
                        thought and one which we will wish to discuss when we meet.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> has told me in
                        great detail of his talks with you and some of your Ministers. I want to

                        his mission to Pakistan and India last week and for the personal message you
                        asked him to give me.</p>
                    <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0447"/>
                    <p>“I am gratified that a start will be made on Kashmir, and I want to
                        congratulate you on the statesmanlike approach you have taken. There is
                        understanding here, of course, that a quick and easy solution to the problem
                        is not possible. As you indicated to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName>, a settlement of the Kashmir issue will cause
                        dissatisfaction among many in India and Pakistan. Yet you have shown
                        yourself prepared to go ahead with determination to reach a settlement. The
                        coming months will be a test of the patience, perseverance and good will of
                        both countries. I welcome your decision most warmly. We stand prepared to
                        give appropriate support and assistance in the search for a solution.</p>
                    <p>“Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> has told me of your
                        appreciation of the threat that Chinese Communist aggression against India
                        poses to Pakistan and, with the settlement of Kashmir, of the long term need
                        of a combined plan for the defense of the subcontinent. Your discernment in
                        this matter, going beyond the passions of the moment, is of the highest
                        importance for your country and the whole free world. Governor <persName

                        understand the need for the United States and the United Kingdom to give
                        military assistance to India to the extent necessary to make it possible for
                        India to contain and defeat a renewed Chinese attack. This is the purpose
                        for which we have been giving emergency military aid to India, and will
                        guide us in consideration of longer-term programs. We shall keep in touch
                        with you about further developments in our military aid to India.<note n="1"

                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> has told me of his
                        good talks with you and your associates. I am grateful to you for the
                        cordiality with which you received him and for sharing with him so
                        completely your thoughts on the problems facing India and the subcontinent.
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> was particularly
                        struck by the vigor and resolution of your country's response to the
                        long-term Chinese Communist threat. He told me of the courage your people
                        are showing under your leadership and of the high morale of the Indian armed
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>We are now actively considering what we can do to meet your requirements for
                        military equipment and supplies. We are, of course, consulting with the
                        United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and I plan to review these matters with
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> when I see
                        him in the Bahamas. Our object is to arrive at a general plan for handling
                        your needs quickly from the best source of supply. Our people will soon be
                        in touch with yours on this subject.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know how pleased I am by the statement you and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> issued concerning your
                        intentions to move forward at an early date towards a solution of the
                        difficult Kashmir problem. We appreciate how difficult it is for you at this
                        moment, when the memory of the recent Chinese attack combines with the
                        prospect of a further one, to turn your attention to the old and troublesome
                        problem of Kashmir. Yet an effective defense against the Chinese threat to
                        India depends on your ability to concentrate your full resources on meeting
                        their aggression. Further, since the threat extends to the whole
                        subcontinent, ultimately the efforts of the whole subcontinent will be

                        responsibility firmly fixed on India and Pakistan for working out solution.
                        Because of Commonwealth ties, and less close British identification with
                        previous efforts to move this problem towards solution, we believe British
                        should be kept in forefront of this effort. Contents of this message have
                        been discussed with British Embassy here and we envisage close cooperation
                        this subject between our Embassies New Delhi and Karachi with respective
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> High Commissions. Embassy London
                        should discuss contents this message with appropriate British officials.</p>
                    <p>Our general approach is that British and ourselves should identify in both
                        India and Pakistan those points at which effective pressure can be brought
                        to impress both governments that it is in interest both countries strive for
                        agreement despite possible political costs. Prospects for settlement will be
                        improved if each side enters talks with eyes open; if each side realizes
                        from outset that it must make substantial concessions which will be
                        unpopular with many in both countries.</p>

                        would limit possibility compromise which will be essential. Also restriction
                        scope discussions would lessen chances for agreement. For time being we
                        believe thrust of your approaches should be to encourage parties come up
                        with ideas about possible solution. If they want to discuss them with us and

                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> dated December 13:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Friend,</p>
                    <p>I am sending you these further thoughts about the Indian problem. Although I
                        doubt whether we could reach any conclusion until we meet. I am very glad to
                        hear that <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is going to be
                        available on Thursday, December 20. Since <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> is in the area I have asked him to be available also
                        that afternoon.</p>
                    <p>My first thoughts about the military problem are as follows:</p>
                    <p>Some five or six divisions are likely to be used against the Chinese in the
                        mountains. All these forces should be equipped not on the scale of
                        continental armies with tanks and armoured cars and all the rest of it for
                        fighting in the plain, but as mountain troops. Some two brigades have lost
                        all their equipment and the rest of three divisions were badly mauled. The
                        initial task is to re-equip these and supplement the equipment of the rest
                        of the force.</p>
                    <p>The experts are working on this, but I doubt if it will cost as much as a
                        hundred and twenty million dollars. I agree with your suggestion that the
                        bill during the 'emergency' stage should be shared between the United States
                        and Commonwealth countries. Secondly, what sort of <pb n="431"
                            xml:id="pg_431" facs="0457"/>army should the Indians have to fill the
                        major role of defending themselves against an all-out Chinese invasion? It
                        is clear to me that any sensible defense, on whatever scale may be agreed,
                        can only be effective if it is organized as a joint Pakistani-Indian plan to
                        defend the subcontinent as a whole. This would be far more effective, less
                        wasteful of troops, and would avoid our chief difficulty which is how to
                        help the Indians without correspondingly upsetting the Pakistanis who are
                        loyal friends and members of the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> pacts. Therefore, this involves
                        the political problem of an agreement about Kashmir. Thirdly, even if you do
                        get a defence system for the sub-continent as a whole, I do not myself
                        believe that the kind of army which these two countries can sustain would be
                        capable of defending themselves by themselves against any massive attack. If
                        they were complete dictatorships they might try to do it by an absolute
                        priority of guns over butter but their populations and the economies of the
                        countries could hardly do it. Under any democratic system it would be
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>This leads me therefore to conclude that what we must aim at is getting first
                        the two parties to agree on the joint defence of the sub-continent as a
                        whole and then perhaps to get them into one of the regional military pacts.
                        This would mean that the Chinese, like the Russians, would hesitate before
                        making a massive attack for they would never be sure that they would not
                        draw down upon themselves the nuclear reply.</p>
                    <p>Now comes the difficult question—how can we get political agreement between
                        India and Pakistan? In any agreement Pakistan must obviously keep the part
                        of Kashmir she at present occupies (with perhaps some adjustments) and the
                        Indians must keep Jammu and Ladakh. The problem centres on the vale of
                        Kashmir. A plebiscite will never be accepted by the Indians. It is just
                        possible that they might agree to the vale of Kashmir becoming an autonomous
                        state guaranteed by both India and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Now comes the question of how we are to encourage <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to reach agreement. I have
                        thought over your suggestion of appointing a high-level go-between; but I
                        think this presents difficulties. A suitable individual would be hard to
                        find, and his appointment would be interpreted as an attempt by us to act as
                        mediators which would certainly be resented in Delhi. I doubt therefore
                        whether he would be able to exercise effective influence.</p>
                    <p>It is the Indians who must make the first move. If they show a disposition to
                        compromise, we can bring pressure on the Pakistanis to abate their extreme
                        demands.</p>
                    <p>It occurs to me that the best way of keeping up the pressure would be to
                        arrange for a series of visits to both countries by American and British
                        personalities during the next few weeks and months. Without getting <pb
                            n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0458"/>too directly involved they could
                        encourage Indian and Pakistani ministers to settle their differences.
                        Perhaps you would consider this idea.</p>
                    <p>We have one important card in our hands, namely India's independence [<hi
                            rend="italic">dependence</hi>] on the West for military aid. But if we
                        overplay the hand we could easily destroy the favourable atmosphere which
                        recent events have created. It will obviously be unwise for us (whether
                        through special envoys or through our regular diplomatic representatives) to
                        threaten the Indians with the withdrawal of military aid if they fail to
                        reach agreement with Pakistan. On the other hand, visiting ministers, who
                        are not directly concerned, Generals or prominent personalities outside our
                        governments could without the same danger more easily adopt the role of the
                        candid friend.</p>
                    <p>Lastly there is the question of air defence. I think there is much to be said
                        for your proposal to provide the Indians with radar and other ground
                        equipment, presumably to train Indians to use it. You and we might from time
                        to time fly in squadrons of fighters to show our ability to come to India's
                        aid should we decide to do so. But I do not think we should enter into any
                        formal or moral obligation to participate in an Indian war with China. If we
                        did, we should be giving India a greater measure of protection than we have
                        been willing to do for our Allies in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>
                        and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. If, of course, India and
                        Pakistan decide to form together a joint defence system for the whole
                        subcontinent, we could bring them under the general western umbrella to the
                        same extent as the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers. All this raises far-reaching
                        issues which we must discuss together. In the meantime, I thought you might
                        like to have our preliminary thoughts.</p>

                    <p>Our approach to all these tends naturally to caution. The <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> worry over any redeployment of US forces at
                        the expense of existing commitments. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        seems to look askance at large new <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        outlays, which might involve diversions from other <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> clients and be difficult in any case to justify to
                        Congress. Some in State are concerned lest we get drawn into a major
                        Sino-Indian war. Others fear that our <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        interests will suffer unless we gear our help to progress on Kashmir. Such
                        reservations largely underly our desire to push the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> out in front. But, judging from <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                            >Macmillan</persName>'s letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d224">Document 224</ref>.</note> the British attitude is
                        similarly cautious; indeed they show less sense of urgency than we.</p>
                    <p>Against such concerns that we will overcommit ourselves or waste our
                        substance must be weighed the sheer magnitude of the opportunity handed us
                        by Peiping. If we exploit it fully we may not only bring about a Kashmir
                        settlement and <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Indian reconciliation,
                        but induce an aroused and strengthened India to join us in the containment
                        of Red China.</p>
                    <p>But in deciding how best to promote this grand design, one fundamental must
                        be kept in mind. It was a Chinese blunder which gave us the opportunity and
                        it is only a continued active <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>
                        threat which will compel <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to compromise on Kashmir in the interest of
                        meeting the larger threat.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is as much in our strategic interest to keep up a high degree of
                        Sino-Indian friction as it is to prevent it from spilling over into large
                        scale war. While, in the last analysis, our ability to do so may be marginal
                        as compared to what Peiping and Delhi themselves decide, <hi rend="italic"
                            >to the extent that we can reassure India of US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> support and backing, we stiffen Indian determination not
                            to settle too cheaply.</hi></p>
                    <p>Yet the cease-fire and Chinese withdrawals have already led to a hiatus
                        period. Peiping, having achieved its objectives and doubtless fearful of
                        over-extending itself, is skillfully disengaging. It has thrown on India the
                        onus of re-opening hostilities, which it knows India is incapable of doing
                        at this point.</p>
                    <p>While hostilities may yet flare up again, the more likely outcome seems to be
                        a gradual petering out of the Sino-Indian affair. While Sino-Indian
                        relations will never be the same, and Indian public opinion will <pb n="436"
                            xml:id="pg_436" facs="0462"/>bar any negotiated settlement, the trend
                        may be toward de facto acceptance of the Chinese terms, particularly if the
                        latter are wise enough to carry out their proposed withdrawals.</p>
                    <p>Certain US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> actions might well contribute to
                        this trend: (1) if we push the Kashmir issue out too far in front of the
                        Sino-Indian dispute, thus diverting Indian focus and reviving old Pak-Indian
                        animosities; (2) if the US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> seem to be
                        holding back unduly on further support, thus rousing Indian suspicions that
                        we are either reluctant to assume major commitments or unwilling to do so
                        until Kashmir is settled.</p>
                    <p>In short, against the risks of overcommitment are those of loss of
                        momentum—which might contribute to a premature damping down of the
                        Sino-Indian dispute. My comments on the issues before you are framed in this
                        light.</p>

                        advantages in getting our cousins to share as much of the burden as possible
                        hardly need enumeration. But, aside from <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s worry lest the British gain kudos with the

                        itself to anything with a large price tag, or about backing India in a
                        Sino-Indian war. It also suggests, despite his reminder that we shouldn't
                        overplay our hand, that the British have in mind setting several
                        conditions—a Kashmir settlement, joint <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                        >Pak</gloss>-Indian defense, and Indian membership in our alliance system—as

                        nor the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> want to get involved in any
                        interim commitment to shore up India's air defense with US/<gloss

                            facs="0463"/>Nor, as <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                        suggests, would the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> division of the
                        longer run effort be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. We
                        suspect that the financing problem plays a large part in their
                        reluctance.</p>
                    <p>Against the risks involved in air defense commitments we must balance the
                        cost of turning down or stalling on <persName>Nehru</persName>'s request. To
                        do so might well rouse Indian suspicions that the West was either unwilling
                        to support India if the conflict escalated or insisted on a high price. In
                        either case, the net effect might be to sap India's confidence in Western
                        support of its position vis-a-vis China. If our interests are best served by
                        continuation of the Sino-Indian dispute, we want if possible to avoid such a
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, I believe that the Indians (and probably also the Chinese) already
                        assume from our posture that we are prepared to come to India's help. Our
                        failure to do so would, as <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                        suggests, be a grave blow to Indian morale. But we will be unable to do so
                        effectively unless prior preparations are made.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we must take into account the possibility that our failure to
                        provide air defense support, should it become known, might encourage Peiping
                        to escalate, whereas evidence of such support would greatly deter them from
                        doing so. I fear, therefore, that not providing such support may create
                        greater risks of escalation (and subsequent US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> involvement) than the opposite course.</p>
                    <p>As to the US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> division of effort, I cannot
                        see the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> committing fighter squadrons
                        unless the US does the same. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> simply
                        will not risk involvement in a Sino-Indian war without the US by its
                        side.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Kashmir Tactics</hi>. It is painfully apparent that neither
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s nor Indians are yet ready for

                        to press too hard at this juncture might scuttle the talks before they

                            <item>State's idea of technical committees is good but, by itself, does

                                opinion, especially in Pakistan. So we should examine what “interim
                                steps” might be feasible in addition. I have in mind mutual
                                withdrawals from the cease-fire line, trade concessions, etc. To the
                                extent that such moves had a joint character, they might (though
                                billed as interim expedients) actually start a trend toward an

                    <p>The above comments add up to suggesting a more costly and more risky strategy

                        that Peiping never contemplated a major attack on India. To me, it is all
                        the more unlikely to let the affair escalate if India has visible US/<gloss

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1">Nehru</persName> apologized for
                        requesting an appointment on what he knew was one of the President's busiest
                        days. His Government, however, wished to present some views on the Kashmir
                        problem to the President before the Nassau Conference. The Indian High
                        Commissioner in London was under instructions to make a similar approach to
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that his Government wanted the President to be aware that
                        Pakistan is undermining the prospects of fruitful talks on Kashmir by a
                        steady stream of abusive statements about India emanating from public
                        officials and the press. He said his Government fears that Pakistanis are
                        doing this only because they believe that they have the United States in a
                        position in which it will not give military assistance to India unless India
                        satisfies Pakistan's claims in Kashmir. The Government of India supposes
                        that the United States has not made such a commitment to Pakistan, and
                        believes it would be helpful if the point could be clarified with the
                        Pakistanis. Otherwise the Pakistanis are likely to enter the Kashmir talks
                        thinking they can hold India to ransom. His Government also hopes that the
                        President will realize that the Kashmir problem and other difficulties
                        between India and Pakistan have deep roots and are extremely difficult to
                        solve. The Government of India is prepared to go into these talks in good
                        faith, but the Prime Minister hopes that the President will realize progress
                        may be slow and unspectacular, even if the Pakistanis show more willingness
                        to cooperate than they have done until now.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like to make a personal response and then an
                        official response. Speaking personally, he said, he felt the Prime Minister
                        had erred in making a statement in Parliament which would <pb n="440"
                            xml:id="pg_440" facs="0466"/>give the Pakistanis a handle to charge that
                        India was not serious about the Kashmir talks. The Pakistanis are not only
                        attacking India, they are also trying to get at the United States. Indeed,
                        the next few months are likely to be a period of continuous effort by
                        Pakistan and by Pakistan's friends in this country to put pressure on him,
                        the President. In this situation he would hope the Prime Minister could
                        ignore the abusive and other unfortunate remarks being made. The best
                        posture would be to enter seriously in the discussions and show the world
                        that India is determined to reach some sort of settlement.</p>
                    <p>The President observed that the coming period will require the most subtle
                        and skillful policy on the part of India. On the one hand, he supposed that
                        no Indian politician could involve his country in negotiations with Pakistan
                        if Indian opinion came to believe that the West was forcing India to give up
                        Kashmir as a price for helping it to save Ladakh or even <gloss
                            target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>. On the other hand, some progress would
                        be very important. India wants us to understand its problems, and we try to
                        do so. At the same time, the President hoped that India could understand our
                        problems here. Whether we like it or not, the question of Kashmir is
                        inescapably linked to what we can do to assist India militarily. He was sure
                        the Ambassador would understand this and could communicate it to his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded by observing that we get a lot of abuse, as India
                        feels it does. The problem is how to ignore it and get on with the job that
                        has to be done. He hoped that the Prime Minister would see his way clear to
                        a constructive settlement, because <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> is the only man in Pakistan who can carry off a
                        settlement that involves heavy compromise of Pakistani claims and it may be
                        that <persName>Nehru</persName> is the one man who could do the same in
                        India.</p>

                        December 5, 1962,<note n="1" xml:id="d228fn1">See <ref target="#d217"
                                >Document 217</ref>.</note> which was delivered to me by Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I appreciate very much that you and your Government have taken a firm and
                        positive decision to take appropriate steps to support and assist towards a
                        satisfactory settlement of the Kashmir dispute. As Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> must have told you, I for my part,
                        found no difficulty in taking the decision which led to the issue of the
                        Joint Communique. We are now getting ready to meet the Indian delegation on
                        the 26th instant in Rawalpindi and sincerely hope that realistic discussions
                        for the honourable and equitable settlement of the Kashmir question will
                        take place. All this will depend on how sincere Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> is for reaching such a settlement.</p>
                    <p>It is most unfortunate that he should have thought it fit to make his
                        statement in the Lok Sabha, on the day following the publication of the
                        Joint Communique, which came as a surprise to everybody and raised doubts in
                        our minds. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> must
                        have been as surprised as <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan
                            Sandys</persName> was to read this statement by Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> must have conveyed
                        to you my view that a just and equitable settlement of Kashmir is the key to
                        disengagement between India and Pakistan. I told him that U.S. Government
                        should put all possible pressure on India either by refusing to give aid
                        until a settlement on Kashmir is reached, or deciding to give it in small
                        and negligible quantities until India is obliged to see reason in this
                        regard. I am saying this as otherwise the effectiveness of the American aid
                        to India would be lost.</p>
                    <p>You must be aware, Mr. President, that there is considerable alarm in this
                        country in regard to the arms aid that has been sent to India. Should the
                        volume of aid to India increase without settlement with us, it would result
                        in serious disadvantages to us and is bound to cause greater alarm and
                        criticism in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In the course of my talk with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName>, General Adams and other members of the Harriman
                        Mission, I pointed out to General Adams that it seemed that what India was
                        after was to build up two Armies, one of which would be concentrated <pb
                            n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0468"/>against Pakistan and the other
                        could also be deployed against us when they should want to do so. Surely
                        this can't be the objective of the American policy. In this connection, I
                        arranged briefing by our General Staff to Governor Harriman's team. It comes
                        out very clearly that the present strength of the Indian Army is enough to
                        contain the Chinese and contain us should they insist on pursuing this
                        negative course.</p>
                    <p>I also told him that in the face of India's performance during their
                        engagement with the Chinese, Indian leadership in the field gave a very poor
                        account of itself. I, therefore, advised that the Indians should be
                        encouraged to reach a negotiated and a peaceful settlement with the Chinese
                        and discouraged from launching on a military adventure to 'evict' the
                        Chinese. Such an attempt might lead to a major conflict which it should be
                        the duty of all of us to avert. It might easily spark off a conflagration,
                        not only on this sub-continent but engulf the whole of Asia and even pose a
                        threat to world peace. The Indians have shown that they have become
                        trigger-happy and they should be firmly discouraged from any ideas they
                        might have to launch an attack for the eviction of the Chinese. I believe
                        the British share this view to some extent.</p>
                    <p>I also pointed out to General Adams that their target of equipping 15 or 16
                        divisions for action against the Chinese in those mountainous regions did
                        not make any military sense, as more than a very small number of divisions
                        cannot be deployed in those regions. It would, therefore, appear as if what
                        the Indians were interested in was to continue to maintain the bulk of their
                        forces, equipped with modern arms and in greater strength, against Pakistan.
                        That is why I have been urging that until the Kashmir question is
                        satisfactorily resolved, there can be no disengagement between India and
                        Pakistan in order that we may both live free from anxiety from each other.
                        It is, therefore, most important that your efforts should be directed to the
                        early settlement of the Kashmir question and I would strongly urge that any
                        further supply of arms to India is made contingent on this settlement. I am
                        fully convinced that the Indian in his present circumstances is in a mood to
                        listen, provided a forceful and a positive effort is made in the direction
                        to persuade him.</p>
                    <p>I am grateful to you, Mr. President, for kindly saying that you will keep in
                        touch with us about any further developments in your military aid to
                        India.</p>
                    <p>I entirely agree with you that this is a great opportunity which
                        circumstances have brought about for a satisfactory solution of Kashmir and
                        that, if resolutely tackled, there is every hope of success. In this I look
                        forward to your personal and your Government's fullest cooperation and
                        help.</p>
                    <p>With my kindest regards,</p>
                    <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                        important point.</p>
                    <p>Admitting some differences exist between costs Iranian and Pakistan routes,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> said further study by <gloss

                            target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. There were basic differences in transit
                        costs between goods moving Khorramshahr-Kandahar for <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> and for <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss>. On basis

                            >Daud</persName> felt higher <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> transit
                        costs could be substantially reduced. For example gasoline was cheaper
                        shipped through Iran while diesel more expensive.</p>
                    <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> called in Rafiq to
                        give detailed analysis comparative cost figures Iranian and Pakistan routes
                        (details by pouch). Rafiq's main points were that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss> had been overcharged on rail freight Khorramshahr-Meshed
                        and on trucking costs Herat-Kandahar. Among other things Rafiq asserted

                        shipments through Iran at one-fifth cost commercial agents now charging.
                        Rafiq cited figures to support conclusion average cost gasoline and diesel
                        needed for our projects approximately $66.38 per ton via Chaman as against
                        $66.34 via Meshed.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister then continued that he hoped statistical presentation, and
                        prospective further reduction in cost diesel <gloss target="#t_RGA1"
                            >RGA</gloss> buying from Iran, indicative what might be done on Iranian
                        route. He then proposed <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> and <gloss

                    <p>Prime Minister next turned to question future US assistance, reiterating

                        support on any given project. I recalled had previously told both Prime
                        Minister and Foreign Minister I would not condone any real complaint
                        regarding substantive lethargy or bureaucratic inaction in aid program.

                        Our own statistics were based on our experience where we perhaps had not
                        gotten same favorable treatment in all instances as Afghanistanis. Question

                        via Iran could certainly be examined and perhaps Afghan-Iran-US meeting

                        might help in future, fact was we had major problem now.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AA1">Aziz</persName> asked pointedly whether <persName

                        outlined difficulty maintaining momentum on such major project as K-K road.
                        Recalled I had told Prime Minister last May this situation would develop
                        unless border opened and said that our extraordinary costs now so high that
                        we didn't see how work on road could continue beyond end December. This why
                            <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> asked whether there might be some
                        way reopen border temporarily for 30-60 days for this road project. While
                        said would naturally report what Prime Minister had already told me, it

                        also report Prime Minister prepared meet our problem on road through

                    <p>Expressing appreciation my remarks, Prime Minister said his earlier comments

                    <p>To first question, Prime Minister responded <gloss target="#t_RGA1"
                            >RGA</gloss> had sought negotiate on Pushtunistan question. However,

                        not wish be part Pakistan. Obvious solution would be self-determination.
                            <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> simply desired Pushtun people be

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> recalled had outlined foregoing

                        on down. Had also made same points to <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> in
                        past discussions. Referring latter, he said Prime Minister Suhrawardi had
                        once asked if <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> desired annex territory.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> said he had replied he would
                        give written engagement foreswearing annexation if assured Pushtuns would
                        have self-determination. <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> had

                    <p>Thanking Prime Minister for his frankness, I said our discussions would not
                        be complete were I not to express our great fear that, while working for
                        objective which in their eyes deemed praiseworthy, <gloss target="#t_RGA1"
                            >RGA</gloss> would leave itself open predatory forces which might one
                        day cause loss not only Pushtunistan but Afghanistan as well. Prime Minister
                        asked how this might occur. I told him we had seen techniques communism had
                        used, including exploitation political issue such as Pushtunistan to serve
                        their own ends. By supporting divisive regional issues communists made
                        neighboring states increasingly dependent on them. This predatory force
                        would take every advantage of country so placed as Afghanistan. There had so
                        far been no single instance in which such a country had avoided communist
                        toils and <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> was taking terrible chance in
                        assuming it might be first not fall prey this technique.I assured Prime

                        determined, brave and dedicated people whose society founded on religious
                        principles but reminded him that sometimes even all this not enough prevent
                        disaster. Prime Minister merely remarked with smile in closing that it was
                        precisely for this reason he had emphasized how greatly Afghanistan needs

                    <p>The President opened the discussion of the Agenda Item on the Sino-Indian
                        dispute with mention of the Indian High Commissioner's approach to the Prime
                        Minister and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1">B.K. Nehru</persName>'s
                        approach to him<note n="1" xml:id="d230fn1">See <ref target="#d227">Document
                                227</ref>.</note> just before the Nassau talks. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_NBK1">Nehru</persName> had complained that the Pakistanis
                        were behaving badly and had urged the United States not to expect much
                        progress on the Kashmir issue. He himself feared that in two or three months
                        India would blame the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US for
                        making a Kashmir settlement their price for providing military aid.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> saw the immediate
                        danger as an impasse between India and Pakistan, since both cannot possess
                        the Valley of Kashmir. In considering the next steps he felt it should be
                        kept clearly in mind that the principal gain of the new situation is in
                        getting India out of its somewhat feckless mood and turned against the
                        Chinese danger to the world. He felt some concern that in Washington, at
                        least, the great problem seems to be Kashmir rather than China. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> had achieved a great
                        gain in getting the talks started. Now the problem was to keep the talks
                        going and to keep them from heading into a direct confrontation over the
                        issue of who owns or should own the Valley. One way might be to feed a
                        variety of ideas into the two governments. In the short run India must learn
                        that it must make its case to the American public and Congress, who are
                        concerned about progress on Kashmir. The Congress <pb n="449"
                            xml:id="pg_449" facs="0475"/>would not support two sides of the dispute.
                        We must not however tell the Indians that further help is conditioned on a
                        Kashmir settlement. This approach would get their back up and would enable
                        them to assert that the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are
                        forcing them to compromise Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> reported that in
                        London the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> teams had agreed to
                        recommend that the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/Commonwealth
                        provide equipment necessary to convert six Indian Army divisions to mountain
                        units, to help India's airlift capacity, and to improve India's air combat
                        ability within the scope of India's present type of aircraft. These
                        judgments had been reached on the basis that the contributions of the US and
                        of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>/Commonwealth would be roughly
                        equivalent within a ceiling of $60,000,000 for each side and that both the
                        US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would encourage other nations to
                        assist India as well. In London the parties had agreed to give the financial
                        figures to the Indians. Subsequently, in Washington, it was decided we had
                        better not tell the Indians at this time just how much money we plan to
                        commit to the emergency phase. On the question of giving this information to
                        Pakistan, it was left open to our representative there. The group had not
                        thought these amounts would prove unpalatable to Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether this would add any divisions to the Indian Army.
                        Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that it would not explicitly do so,
                        though the Indians might well add some divisions outside the US-<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> assistance plan.</p>
                    <p>On air defense, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said that it was envisaged
                        that a team would go out promptly to look at radar and communications
                        matters and at the possibility of rotating squadrons, perhaps four in
                        number, into India. The President asked questions to confirm that the idea
                        was that the team should go out and that consideration was being given to
                        four squadrons, evenly divided between the US and the Commonwealth, which
                        perhaps would move in and out of India rather than staying there all the
                        time. He observed that their role would be limited to air defense.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> suggested that we
                        should have some understanding with the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        that it would consult with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US on
                        any decision to commit air squadrons to action. He had pointed out this fact
                        to Foreign Minister <persName>Desai</persName> who had commented that it
                        sounded reasonable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> called the question
                        of air squadrons a very big issue. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-US
                        talks seem to have gone quite a long way toward agreement on helping during
                        an emergency phase. We want always to emphasize that we expect the Indians
                        to do what they can do themselves, with production, etc., and that this will
                        involve sacrifice on their part as well as on ours. It would undoubtedly
                        also involve some slowing down of activities on the civil side. He regarded
                        the agreement that the U.S. and U.K./Commonwealth keep to $60,000,000 for
                        each as a reasonable <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0476"/>development.
                        On describing these terms to the Indians, he felt we must play the matter by
                        ear. At the beginning, it would be best not to tell them the exact amounts
                        but we must give them some idea of the dimensions of assistance as they are
                        getting quite big ideas about what is possible. On air defense, he believed
                        it was right to send a mission but wished to make it clear that this did not
                        represent any commitment. Assistance in air defense could easily become a
                        very large commitment. Although we are going on to help the Indian Army
                        through the emergency phase without an Indian commitment on Kashmir, we must
                        make it clear that assistance on the air defense would be impossible without
                        some settlement with Pakistan. Big issues are raised by the question of air
                        squadrons. It is one thing to give rifles, mortars, etc., but another to
                        allow them to base their military plans on the expectation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US providing planes to shoot Chinese.
                        That would mean we would be faced with either letting them down or getting
                        involved in war at their choosing. This could be difficult.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> said that
                        in getting into defense planning the Indians will find that no plan makes
                        sense unless it embraces the defense of the entire subcontinent. He felt
                        they would take this fact better from the military than from political
                        representatives. Therefore, our military people should keep pressing this
                        issue. Also, the defense build up, as the Indians see it, may prove to be
                        much greater than India's capacity to accomplish, even with Western help.
                        This leads to the conclusion that the only economically possible way of
                        defending India is to bring India within the general umbrella of the Western
                        defense community as we have done with the members of <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>. This does not necessarily mean that India should become
                        a member of one of the Pacts; possibly that would be politically bad.
                        However, it must be made clear to the Chinese Communists that India has
                        become part of our defense area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> added that the immediate
                        need on Kashmir is to avoid having the parties come quickly to the crunch.
                        Rather, they should go slowly. We should try to avoid their breaking down in
                        the early meetings because of a precise confrontation at the outset. If the
                        talks go on, we can probably exercise a certain amount of influence, partly
                        through official channels and partly through carefully selected visitors—a
                        steady drip of opinion expressed by different people in different places
                        emphasizing the importance we attach to a settlement and the very serious
                        difficulties that would confront us in the absence of a settlement. The
                        first move would obviously need to be made by the Indians, and that is what
                        we must concentrate on. The Indians believe now that something could be
                        done; this is not merely <persName>Nehru</persName>'s idea but that of such
                        people as the Defense Minister, military officers, etc. It is quite fertile
                        ground in which to sow this seed. At some stage, if the talks bog down,
                        without linking the <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0477"/>points we could
                        perhaps let deliveries of emergency phase military equipment slow down. The
                        handling of the air mission can be an important influence too.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> observed that it
                        was important to realize that we must do more than talk of the desirability
                        of a settlement. This is already agreed to in India and in Pakistan. The
                        question is, what settlement; India and Pakistan both want the Valley. We
                        won't advance chances of a settlement by making threats. We must remember
                        that the specific settlement is not in the minds of either side now and will
                        come about only through extensive talks if at all. We must also remember
                        that the Kashmir effort is at best a long shot, comparable to the
                        Israel-Arab dispute.</p>
                    <p>On air defense, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>
                        noted that it is expensive. The Indian demand is related to the awful
                        nakedness of the cities, and as non-military people the Indians are acutely
                        conscious of this. Air defense thus is a protection to the country.
                            US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> involvement would be a deterrent
                        force, more than a protective force. The proposals that have been made in
                        this field will work out more cheaply than would an independent Indian air
                        force. It would be also easier with the Pakistanis for us to take this road.
                        We should know that the introduction into India of C-130s with American
                        crews was no problem to the Pakistanis, but if we had given the C-130s to
                        the Indians the Pakistanis would have been furious. The idea of having US
                        and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> squadrons in India would have the same
                        advantage. It would also effectively bring India under the US-<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> umbrella.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> agreed with the last
                        point but commented that the impression would be left that a non-allied
                        country gets better defense protection from the West than does an ally.
                        Also, he felt that this course of action could get us into a war with China
                        in circumstances which we would not control. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                        acknowledged that this could happen but observed that the proposed plan
                        would also be a commitment to keep Indian air action within tactical
                        limitations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> responded that
                        we also need to be careful not to create a situation in which the Pakistanis
                        would feel that other countries would get all the benefits and more of
                        Western help without ceasing to be non-aligned. That is what the Pakistanis
                        are saying. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> had pointed out
                        in reply that the difference is that if a country like Pakistan is in a Pact
                        with the West, there is less chance that it will be attacked by a Communist
                        country, as India had been attacked.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he felt we had
                        not been thinking enough about how to deal with the Pakistanis. There will
                        be a strong reaction in Pakistan. Unless the US and the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> representatives can tell the Pakistanis that
                        we are pressing India hard, there will be trouble. The Pakistanis on their
                        side ought to come away from their extreme position and <pb n="452"
                            xml:id="pg_452" facs="0478"/>begin to work seriously at the problem of a
                        practical solution to the Kashmir issue. They perhaps should come quietly to
                        a moderate position, e.g., that they will not insist on a plebiscite. He
                        felt that unless the two countries come together, we will not have a
                        situation in South Asia worth supporting. He agreed that we do not tell the
                        Indians how far we will commit ourselves to their aid, but rather watch the
                        situation carefully, because unless there is progress we cannot go
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what the chance would be that India would make a deal
                        with the Chinese if we press India on Kashmir. Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> replied that when he and his
                        Mission were in Delhi the Indians were showing themselves to be strongly
                        anti-Chinese. He felt that our target should be joint defense of the
                        subcontinent. When Indians began to realize the enormous costs involved in
                        the defense against the Chinese, he was confident they would see the
                        advantage of making a settlement with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> observed that we must be
                        extraordinarily careful in dealing with this problem. He thought that the
                        Pakistanis could be close to a decision to leave <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> felt there would be
                        trouble if we tell the Pakistanis cold what our plans are for military
                        assistance to India. He believed that General Adams, who had gained the high
                        respect of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and other Pakistanis,
                        might have to go out again.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that what
                        worries him is that, as so often before, we support the people who are
                        troublesome, such as <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, and abandon the people who
                        support us. He was sure it would be dangerous if we let <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> feel we are abandoning him. The equal
                        danger is that India may be overrun. <persName>Nehru</persName>, he feared,
                        might be a bit more uppish now that the Chinese have gone away. He liked the
                        idea that we should start slowly and not go ahead building up armies of the
                        people who for 12 years or more have attacked us, have trumpeted the
                        benefits of being non-aligned, have helped build up the neutralist
                        Afro-Asian Bloc, and who have been, how should he say it, contemptuous—like
                        a camel looking down his nose at you.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reiterated that we
                        must be careful how we tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> of
                        our plans. They must be discussed with him as a soldier in a professional
                        way so that he does not explode. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> believed that we should send Generals Hull and
                        Adams back to discuss, soldier to soldier, what we are doing. It is of the
                        utmost importance, he emphasized, that we deal skillfully with the
                        Pakistanis as well as with the Indians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> concurred that it is right that the situation in
                        Pakistan is potentially very explosive. He said he would not like the job of
                        telling <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> of our plans.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked whether
                        it would not be helpful to cut our programs into installments, informing the
                        Indians and Pakistanis <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0479"/>of one at a
                        time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> observed that it
                        would be easier for <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> if we could
                        identify the divisions we are converting to show that they are old divisions
                        rather than new ones. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> said
                        that the real danger is that the Pakistanis will ask us why we aid India
                        ahead of the aligned countries when we take so much grief from Russia,
                        against whom the aligned countries help us.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked whether
                        the Indians will get <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> fighters.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> replied that
                        this was not yet clear. In any case the delivery of a few <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s would be only a symbolic gesture.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he was
                        not happy about the proposed plan. Money is not the problem, he said, so
                        much as how to explain our actions to the Pakistanis. We should first tell
                        them what we are thinking of and see how they react.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the unanswered question of Chinese intentions, Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he does not think
                        that they plan to take over India. What they have done so far seemed to him
                        to be just a punitive expedition. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> said that it had struck home in India, and there is a
                        fear that the Chinese could do it again. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> observed that unless we are
                        careful the Indians will slide back into their same old arrogance and
                        beautifully detached view toward him and the President. He repeated his
                        belief that we have to get them to face up to the fact of Kashmir. In the
                        long run they depend on the West. In the short run they can be helped by the
                        West—on the condition that they settle Kashmir.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> said he does not believe
                        that the Chinese want to attack India. In his opinion
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> knows that. At the same time he believes that
                        nothing short of further Chinese attack will get <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        to move on Kashmir. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>
                        suggested that to get <persName>Nehru</persName> to move it is not necessary
                        to threaten him. He is a sensitive man.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it is obvious that <persName>Nehru</persName>'s
                        reason for sending the messages to the Prime Minister and to him was to
                        persuade them not to tie Western aid to the Kashmir question. He asked
                        whether we could start with an understanding among ourselves on the
                        limitations of emergency assistance. Then possibly send out Generals Hull
                        and Adams to talk with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> observed that telling the
                        Pakistanis about our assistance plans is a political matter. In saying this
                        he did not mean to decry the ability of General Adams, who had done a good
                        job in the subcontinent. As to how far to tell the Indians what is being
                        planned, he felt that in practice the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> will be talking in dimensions that will be clearer to the
                        Indians.</p>
                    <p>Addressing the Prime Minister, the President asked whether the two of them
                        should get in touch with <persName>Nehru</persName>, saying how important it
                        is to keep negotiations going. Then they might send out Generals Hull and
                        Adams to talk about the 1963 plan. In the course of that round could not <pb
                            n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0480"/>Generals Hull and Adams go up to
                        Pakistan and tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> the sort of
                        things we had been thinking of, adding that it is very important the talks
                        do not break down during the winter. We need to persuade both parties to
                        stay in the talks, even if there is little progress. Otherwise, we would
                        have to threaten to cut off aid to them, and that would not make sense. Let
                        us get a scenario showing what we do, what kind of messages we send to
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, who goes where, etc. In short, let's get
                        clear where we go in 1963.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> asked rather
                        skeptically whether we should send more high-ranking generals out to the
                        subcontinent. Already there are military teams in Delhi, and perhaps we
                        should send diplomatic representatives to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> rather than military men. <persName>Nehru</persName>,
                        he had reason to know, is a difficult man to deal with on this issue. But in
                        India as a whole there is a large movement in the direction of progress on
                        Kashmir, the movement that forced <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                            Menon</persName> out. Beyond <persName>Nehru</persName>, he felt there
                        is not a man in the government who would not ally India with the West
                        tomorrow. The Indian fright of China will continue.</p>
                    <p>The President, recessing the session, asked members of the working party to
                        draft proposals for consideration by the Prime Minister and him later in the
                        afternoon.</p>

                    <p>At the opening of the second session devoted to the Sino-Indian dispute, the

                        the immediate phase by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US.
                        These proposals were discussed and agreed to by the Prime Minister and the
                        President. (See separate paper)<note n="1" xml:id="d231fn1">A copy of the

                    <p>The President asked whether we could get the Indians to begin to request more
                        assistance from the Europeans and the Australians and Canadians. Mr.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> responded that we had tried this. The French
                        are tepid, the Germans have given winter clothing and have arranged to
                        airlift them to India but there has not been much other assistance. He
                        believed that we will have to keep the pressure on to get more help.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> expressed the
                        view that the Pakistanis would be less sensitive to information about
                        equipment that we choose to provide India than to extremely large dollar
                        figures. He would hope that assistance from countries other than the US and
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would also be well publicized, thereby
                        taking some of the heat off us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> observed that if
                        India should receive <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> fighters there is a
                        great danger that Pakistanis would react by pulling out of <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">
                            <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0482"/>CENTO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> added that the influence of
                        three developments, should they occur, would particularly hurt our position
                        in Pakistan. These would be (1) massive assistance to India, (2) no Kashmir
                        settlement, and (3) a pullback by the Chinese. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> observed that if on top of these
                        events the Indians should get <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s and we

                        India, the effect on Pakistan would be disastrous.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what would be so disastrous if the Pakistanis should
                        leave <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> responded that it would be a slap in
                        the face to the West and that Iran would doubtless follow.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what we get from Pakistan. In return for the protection
                        of our alliance and our assistance what do they do for us? Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> responded that
                        Pakistan had offered help in the Laos crisis and in the 1950s had offered to
                        send two divisions to Korea if we would guarantee the defense of Pakistan in
                        the meantime.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that there was
                        some thought that it was better to leave the <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss> question on. There would not be many <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s, at least not soon. In any case the <gloss
                            target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> deal would be a black eye to the Russians.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> interjected that there
                        might, however, be a lot of Russian technicians in India. We would have to
                        make clear to the Indians that we cannot help them with a lot of Russians
                        running around.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> observed that he
                        doubts the <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss> question is important.
                        Probably he could say to the Indians that a condition of our assistance in
                        air defense would be that India should accept no <gloss target="#t_MIG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>s. The Indians might welcome this demarche, which would get
                        them off an uncomfortable hook. He was sure the Russians would greatly
                        welcome it. Beyond getting them too off the hook with India and with
                        Communist China, it would be a great propaganda ploy. To his mind, for us to
                        make such an approach to India would consequently be a most unwise thing to
                        do. On the question of Soviet technicians he did not think they would be
                        likely to come to India in important numbers.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> said that the air defense
                        question alarms him. If we gave air defense to India, he felt certain that
                        the Pakistanis would get out of the Pact at once. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> noted that the proposal to send a
                        team to India does not commit us to any specific further action. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> expressed the view that we
                        ought to go at this air defense question very slowly. It is the only carrot
                        we have left to give India to move on Kashmir. We will have played away our
                        best card; this is the only trump we have left and we should play it slowly.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> stated that his
                        view is quite different. The proposal for air defense assistance is the
                        safest way of handling the problem. We are not proposing to put squadrons
                        into India, but only promising that they would come when India was under air
                        attack.</p>
                    <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0483"/>
                    <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> observed that
                        like everything else this is a question of balance. He said he has been
                        impressed that there has been a great turning to us in India, and we must
                        not repel it. On the other hand, he judged that it is quite clear that
                        Chinese won't attack India seriously. If we do all that is proposed for the
                        Indians and they do not settle Kashmir then we will have lost the last
                        opportunity and the Pakistanis will turn against us. He said that he would
                        be inclined to play this matter of air defense a little slowly; it is the
                        one thing we have with which to exert influence. And, if we should extend
                        the air defense concept to the subcontinent, this would help our situation
                        in Pakistan. In his view, unless something like Chinese pressure causes it,
                        we will not see a settlement of Kashmir. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> is not as strong as he was a year ago, possibly due to
                        his having given expression to some naive ideas about democracies, a
                        parliament, etc. We have to bear in mind all the time the problem of the
                        balance between the prospect of losing the sympathy of India and losing
                        Pakistan. If we lost Pakistan, <persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord
                            Home</persName> added, Iran would follow.</p>
                    <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that on the
                        other side, it would seem to him that it would be well for the air defense
                        team to go out to the subcontinent rapidly to show the Indians that we are
                        interested in this very emotional question. Then the governments could take
                        their time in making a decision. He felt that we would lose an opportunity
                        in not giving a quick response to the Indian plea for assistance in air
                        defense. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> asked
                        what we would get from delaying the air defense exercise. Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> added that it is conceivable that
                        the Chinese will attack again and it is therefore important that we know our
                        minds on air defense in good time.</p>
                    <p>The President summarized the arguments for delays as (1) that air defense
                        assistance is our most important card and (2) it would help persuade the
                        Indians to reach a Kashmir settlement. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> noted, however, that the proposed
                        plan is the one solution of India's air defense problem to which the
                        Pakistanis should have the least complaint.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HLAFD1">Lord Home</persName> raised the question
                        whether in the event a Chinese attack were in our view only a border
                        squabble, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US would under this plan
                        be committed to air defense?</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that agreement be reached that the mission should go
                        out. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> High Commissioner and US
                        Ambassadors on the subcontinent could express their views about the timing,
                        which could then be set by a communication between the Prime Minister and
                        him, say about January 10.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister asked whether it is felt that there is any chance of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s moving on Kashmir. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> replied that there is no chance
                        if both countries demand possession of the Valley. There may <pb n="458"
                            xml:id="pg_458" facs="0484"/>be some sophisticated road toward
                        settlement, on the European model, but the two countries are not ready for
                        this yet.</p>
                    <p>In closing the session, the President suggested that to help the Indians get
                        a sense of the views being expressed, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> could indicate to them the flavor of these
                        meetings on his return to Delhi.</p>

                    <p>Dear President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your two letters of December 17.<note n="1" xml:id="d232fn1"
                            >See the source note, <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> I
                        will answer you separately on the matter of the Tarbela Dam after I have had
                        a chance to hear the views of my advisors on this difficult and complex
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>I have reviewed your other letter with Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> at Nassau. After a full discussion
                        of the problems created by the Chinese Communist aggression against India,
                        we have come to what seems to us a prudent course of action at this time to
                        meet the challenge—a course of action which is in the best interests of the
                        Free World. We agreed on a reasonable and frugal program of military
                        assistance designed solely to enable India to defend itself better should
                        the Chinese Communists renew their attacks at an early date.</p>
                    <p>To deny India the minimum requirements of defense would only encourage
                        further Chinese Communist aggression, an aggression which we both see as
                        posing as grave an ultimate threat to Pakistan as to India. Therefore, the
                        supply of arms for this purpose should not be made contingent on a Kashmir
                        settlement. Beyond this stage, however, we will certainly take any one-sided
                        intransigence on Kashmir into account as a factor in determining the extent
                        and pace of our assistance.</p>
                    <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0485"/>
                    <p>The Prime Minister and I are fully conscious of the great opportunity that
                        now exists for the settlement of this major issue within the Free World. As
                        you know, our primary concern is the long-range defense of the subcontinent
                        within the context of our global strategy. No single step could contribute
                        as much to the security of the subcontinent as the resolution of the Kashmir
                        problem. Despite the probably painful and time consuming process required,
                        we look forward with confidence to real progress in the ministerial
                        discussions which lie ahead.</p>

                        participated in all of our deliberations, will give you a full account of

                    <p>I have thought a great deal about the problems of the defense of the

                        the particular problem of air defense, we propose to send at an early date a
                        joint <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-US team for full explorations with
                        you and your people.</p>
                    <p>We also discussed what the subcontinent can do to direct its energies more
                        fully toward its defense. We were both greatly encouraged by the historic
                        decision of India and Pakistan to take up in direct talks the great problems
                        which separate you. Protracted and time consuming as these talks may have to
                        be, we were confident that you and President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> will be able to work out solutions. Nothing could

                        go over these matters with you in some detail.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2"

                            Kennedy's letter to <persName>Nehru</persName> on December 27. He noted
                            the plan to send a U.S.-U.K. military team to explore India's air
                            defense requirements, and he outlined the U.S.-U.K. agreement to fund
                            the conversion of six Indian Army divisions to mountain warfare
                            divisions. He added that the question of longer term defense support
                            would have to be made in light of a further assessment of Chinese
                            intentions and the larger problem of the defense of the subcontinent.

                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>Throughout our meeting <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                                remained relaxed, cordial and very friendly. He was very grateful
                                for President Kennedy's letter and for comprehensive briefing I gave
                                him on Washington and Nassau proceedings. Most important he took
                                news of your decision to provide 100 to 120 million dollars
                                emergency arms aid to India without expressing any disagreement.
                                Even when I pressed him for specific reaction, he avoided any
                                expression disapproval. While he did not give specific approbation,
                                he avoided argument against rationale for emergency arms aid and in
                                fact by implication accepted it when he acknowledged that our
                                initial shipment of military aid to India and over all United States
                                involvement in support of India had proved one of two major
                                deterrents, in his judgment, to further Chinese attacks. (Other
                                deterrent was over-extended Chinese Communist supply lines in <gloss

                                    >Ayub</persName> made clear that he still felt
                                    <persName>Nehru</persName> would not be moved to negotiate
                                Kashmir settlement except under pressure from United States and
                                United Kingdom. While he did not contest our view that emergency
                                arms aid could not be withheld as condition for progress in Kashmir
                                negotiations, he pointedly asked whether we felt failure to make
                                this aid conditional would harden Indian position in forthcoming
                                ministerial talks. I told him that we did not believe this to be
                                true and were emphasizing importance we attached to progress towards
                                Kashmir solution regarding longer range aid to <pb n="462"

                                    pressed for a solution based on a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Singh</persName> countered that
                                    India was a secular state and could not countenance a plebiscite
                                    based on religious principles. (Telegram 19 from Murree,

                                    >Ayub</persName> intimated that his reaction to our emergency
                                arms aid program would ultimately depend on Indian attitude at
                                ministerial talks and that his current tolerant and non-committal
                                reaction could harden if it appeared Indians were taking unwarranted
                                comfort from our continued unconditional provision of emergency aid
                                and adopting as result completely negative attitude in talks. On
                                other hand if Indians show any inclination to explore avenues to
                                resolution of Kashmir issue, I believe <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                    >Ayub</persName> will continue tacit acquiescence in emergency

                                Indians here indicate they have come to Rawalpindi for more than
                                courtesy call which is all most Pakistanis now expect.</item>

                        It took forbearance from Indians and some effort on our part to limit

                    <p>On their side, Indians have shown bad judgment in issuing invitation to

                    <p>Our role in this process should continue to be one of exercising influence
                        from sidelines. When either side makes faux pas, we should call attention to

                        This might be enunciation to Indians during next round of principle, which

                    <p>While playing this watchdog role we should not, however, become directly
                        involved in preparations for Jan 15 talks. We should encourage both sides

                        this stage by reviewing with them the entire range of various proposals
                        which have been made for settlement dispute. We hope that two <gloss

                        might be well to make sure Indians aware of this need. Also probably helpful
                        remind both sides constructive communique would have useful effect. Finally,

                        for massive military assistance from the West.</p>

                    <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> has informed
                        me of the extent of your immediate programme of supply of arms to India
                        which you and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>
                        consider necessary to meet India's minimum requirements of defence. You have
                        made it clear that this programme is not contingent on a Kashmir settlement.
                        While the quantum of military support to India which you have decided to
                        extend in the Nassau meeting may appear to be frugal in the context of your
                        global strategy, we fear that it is sufficiently massive to alter the
                        present ratio of military strength as between Pakistan and India and
                        aggravate the danger to our security.</p>
                    <p>“Only a speedy and just Kashmir settlement can give us any assurance that the
                        contemplated increase of India's military power is not likely to be deployed
                        against Pakistan in the future.</p>
                    <p>“I agree completely with your judgment that no single step could contribute
                        as much to the security of the sub-continent as the resolution of the
                        Kashmir problem. Despite the discouraging and provocative utterances of Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> on the subject, we are pursuing our sincere
                        efforts to negotiate with India a solution which would meet three
                        requirements: Respect for the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir;
                        protection of the vital interests of Pakistan; and due regard for such
                        claims of India as could be considered legitimate.</p>
                    <p>“It is only with reference to these three basic criteria that a correct
                        judgment can be made as to the one-sidedness or otherwise of the
                        intransigence which India is very likely to show in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>“I am confident that you will view with understanding and sympathy our
                        efforts to reach an equitable and honorable settlement with India on the
                        basis of the three essential principles that I have mentioned.</p>
                    <p>“No country in the world has so much in its power to promote a just and
                        peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute as the United States. If the flow
                        of your arms supplies is so regulated as to influence India to negotiate in
                        a more amenable frame of mind, positive results are bound to follow.</p>
                    <p>“With best wishes for your health, happiness and prosperity in the new year,
                        Yours sincerely, (Signed) <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">M.

                    <p>Meanwhile, the second round of Kashmir talks begins 16 January in Delhi. The
                        first round went off without undue bickering (indeed with glimmerings of
                        hope) but each successive round will be more difficult. Each side is trying
                        to get the other to make the first move. We may have to step in as honest
                        brokers before too long, lest the talks break down in a contest of
                        silence.</p>

                            similar British team is now in India. While its terms of reference are
                            narrow—limited to ordinance and existing facilities—ours will be broad
                            enough to cover such industries as communications and textiles and to
                            include new facilities. We estimate that our team will leave the U.S. on

                        <p>The U.K. has informed the old Commonwealth countries of the Nassau

                            working within the planning basis. We also plan to brief the same

                            roughly divided into three categories: equipment sent by initial airlift
                            ($7 million including transportation costs), that sent by sealift ($12.4
                            million) and other ($2.6 million). The material sent by initial airlift,
                            comprising urgently needed Army ground equipment, was shipped between
                            November 3rd and 14th. The sealift equipment, comprising the bulk of the
                            aid, also consists of infantry equipment and ammunition. Of the three
                            vessels transporting it, the first arrived in India on January 4th, and
                            the remaining two are scheduled to arrive on the 13th. The “other”
                            category includes: two Caribou (transport) aircraft now en route to
                            India; <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0496"/>C-119 (transport)
                            aircraft spare parts (the majority as yet undelivered); 50,000 pairs of

                            sets of winter clothing (10,000 via air, arrived January 3, 1963;

                            planning basis, we will have a leeway of about $15 million under the
                            informal ceiling on aid to India as agreed with Senator Humphrey at the
                            time of the Senate-House Conference on the foreign aid authorization
                            bill. Likely air defense commitments and a continued increase in PL-480
                            aid will push us over the top. We are, therefore, initiating
                            consultations with the Congressional leaders regarding the ceiling.</p>

                        <p>We believe the opening round of the India-Pakistan talks on Kashmir went
                            as well as could have been expected. We believe for the present we
                            should continue to concentrate on building an atmosphere in which
                            progress can be made, leaving the substance of the negotiations to the
                            two parties. We have instructed our Embassies in New Delhi and Karachi
                            to take certain steps along these lines.</p>
                        <p>At the same time we are urgently studying other ways by which the U.S.
                            and U.K. can encourage forward movement, including offering good offices
                            when and if they are required.</p>
                        <p>We are particularly concerned over the effect on the talks of increased

                    <p>Our reading from here of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> views and likely negotiating positions in
                        upcoming Delhi talks leads us to conclusion best US course is to continue
                        refrain from making specific proposal at present time. Picture we have is
                        that parties may show some flexibility in this next round; our tactics
                        should be offer friendly off-stage encouragement that they out-vie each
                        other in forthcomingness. We should clearly indicate on both sides that
                        outcome this round will have genuine impact on US and particularly
                        Congressional thinking. Hence, both parties have vested interest in
                        demonstrating disposition to compromise in talks. They should know it
                        remains our conviction most desirable and lasting solution Kashmir question
                        will be that suggested and arrived at by parties themselves. We remain
                        hopeful such solution possible and can be achieved soon.</p>
                    <p>It most important we make clear to both Indians and Pakistanis that we are
                        not prepared see negotiations break down, certainly not at forthcoming
                        talks. Hence, you should continue to urge respective Governments (1) explore
                        any and all proposals; and (2) at minimum agree to continuation
                        ministerial-level talks, and be prepared in advance with communique which
                        will assure this.</p>
                    <p>In event there is clear indication talks foundering you, preferably in
                        concert <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss><gloss target="#t_HICOM1"
                            >HiCom</gloss> but if necessary alone, should inform both sides we will
                        have concrete proposal to submit in nearest future following our assessment
                        Delhi talks; therefore, both sides should agree to further round talks for
                        purpose examining proposal. We believe it would not be advisable to present
                        actual proposal at time talks collapsing as in atmosphere then existing it
                        might be rejected out of hand.</p>
                    <p>We realize Indians prefer purely bilateral consideration this question and
                        have always objected to third party intervention. As matter of tactics, it
                        might be well to put them on notice that whereas we now also prefer
                        bilateral approach, if it does not produce results, US likely make proposal
                        for solution. We hope you can lead Indians to conclusion that in order to
                        avoid problems which US proposal might cause them, they should make extra
                        effort reach agreement in bilateral talks. We see no <pb n="472"

                        in order to stimulate our intervention.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We are presently considering specifics
                        of possible US proposal which we plan finalize after upcoming talks. We will
                        be consulting with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on this and will be in
                        touch with Embassies Delhi and Karachi. Our current thinking is to use this
                        proposal only if bilateral talks on verge breaking down or, after period
                        time, fail make progress. We believe proposal should be single balanced
                        formula which is fair to both sides and would require equal sacrifice. While
                        initial reaction by both parties to such formula might be cool, we believe
                        later consideration would be more serious, particularly as they take into
                        consideration implications rejection re US and Congressional reaction. End

                        <p>To continue our aid program in Afghanistan using the more expensive route
                            through Iran and taking the additional transportation costs out of the

                        <p>The impasse between Afghanistan and Pakistan has continued and the border
                            between the two countries is still closed. We have now reached the point
                            where we can no longer maintain an aid program of the dimension
                            necessary to the achievement of our objectives in Afghanistan and in the
                            area unless we decide to make fuller use of the more expensive route
                            through Iran. Our bilateral relations with Afghanistan, but more
                            importantly our interest and objectives in the surrounding area,
                            principally Iran and Pakistan, are being placed in jeopardy. A good
                            United States posture in Afghanistan is insurance for United States
                            interests and investments in Afghanistan's two neighbors Iran and
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> has come back
                            to participate with us in a review of our policy toward Afghanistan and
                            our objectives there and to work out a course of action designed to
                            achieve these objectives.</p>

                        <p>The instruments available to maintain a United States position in
                            Afghanistan in sufficient force to achieve our objectives are limited.
                            In fact, they revolve around our efforts in the aid field. We have
                            considered four possible courses of action.</p>

                            <item>In view of their stubborness on the border issue, we could inform
                                the Afghans that we would delay implementation of various aid
                                projects until the supply route through Pakistan was open to us for
                                heavy and bulky items needed in various capital projects.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>As a tougher version, we could let the Afghans know that if the
                                border were not open by a certain date we would terminate our aid
                                activities.</item>

                            <item>We could go to the other extreme and expand the fiscal content of
                                our aid program so that the existing levels of aid could be
                                maintained in spite of increased transportation costs through
                                Iran.</item>

                            <item>We could continue our aid program in Afghanistan using the more
                                expensive of the routes through Iran but take the additional
                                transportation costs out of the planned levels of aid.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>Course one is, in effect, what we have been doing over the past 17
                            months. It has not proved effective in getting the border open.</p>
                        <p>Course two would probably produce a negative Afghan response and deal us
                            right out of the country. This would greatly accelerate the country's
                            drift toward the Soviet sphere.</p>
                        <p>Course three would reward the Afghans for their stubborness and remove
                            whatever pressure remains for them to seek a compromise with Pakistan.
                            It would also place us in a very difficult position with Congress.</p>
                        <p>Course four is, in effect, a holding action. We believe it will slow down
                            but not reverse Afghanistan's slide toward the Soviets. However, it does
                            give us an interval during which more favorable conditions could
                            develop. Such developments could include a more moderate government in
                            Afghanistan. Certainly by retaining an effective position in the
                            country, we will strengthen those elements in Afghanistan who wish to
                            continue close ties with the West. Additionally, we will have more time
                            to work for a constructive approach from Pakistan which we are prevented
                            from effectively doing at present because of the tension over the supply
                            of military aid to India.</p>
                        <p>We believe course four is the only logical one available to us. Even
                            though its objectives are limited, we propose to move forward with
                            it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Some Aspects of Implementing This Proposal</hi></p>
                        <p>The major United States project, the Kabul-Kandahar road, has come to
                            symbolize United States interest and position in Afghanistan. To
                            complete this project will clearly demonstrate United States
                            determination to maintain its position in Afghanistan. We propose to
                            complete this project using the route through Iran. Being aware of the
                            effect of extra costs domestically and the need to demonstrate to the
                            Afghans that their stubborn political policies will cost them, we will
                            take the additional transportation costs out of planned aid levels.</p>
                        <p>Completing the road will demonstrate United States determination to aid
                            Afghanistan, but the specifications for two-thirds of the road will be
                            changed from blacktop to gravel to bring the project within the $41.4
                            million obligated. Included in this expenditure by the time this road is
                            completed will have been some $2.6 million of additional transit costs.
                            There are force majeure costs of up to $3.0 million which are
                            additional, but the exact figure will not be known for a considerable
                            period, perhaps years, pending review of claims. Total costs of
                            cancelling the road now without having provided one mile of acceptable
                            road would be $22.0 million.</p>
                        <p>The approach to the road project demonstrates our approach for the
                            over-all program. Projects will be curtailed or specifically selected in
                                <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>order that the additional
                            transit costs will in effect be borne by the Afghan program. In view of
                            the recent IMF Mission and general Afghan Government agreement to their
                            findings, a slower pace of economic development appears not only in
                            order but mandatory. Therefore, what in effect will be a somewhat
                            reduced level of United States aid will probably appear less
                            unpalatable.</p>
                        <p>The grant program in Afghanistan in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1962 was $38.5 million, including $23.7 million for the Kabul-Kandahar
                            road. In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963, the grant program under
                            consideration is for approximately $15.0 million; in addition, a loan
                            program of $5 million is contemplated. The carryover of unliquidated
                            obligations from previous years is about $44 million. Therefore, the
                            actual expenditures in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 will
                            probably reach $30 million. The grant program in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964 will be of the same magnitude, but United States
                            interest in orientating Afghanistan to the Free World through the
                            building of a road to Iran will increase the loan program to
                            approximately $15.0 million.</p>
                        <p>Our efforts in the aid field would be incomplete were we to ignore the
                            dangerous increase in Afghan-Soviet trade over the past few years. An
                            important facet of our efforts, therefore, is to increase Afghan trade
                            with the Free World. Accordingly, we are working with the Afghans to
                            improve the quality of their exports so that they will find larger
                            markets in the West.</p>
                        <p>The increased transit costs make a PL-480 program impractical and this
                            will be dropped.</p>
                        <p>In implementing this course of action, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> on his return, will inform the
                            Afghan Government that the United States has decided to take up the
                            Royal Government of Afghanistan's proposal that the United States avail
                            itself of Afghan forwarding facilities through Iran. In this manner the
                            real costs of this route will be developed so that both we and the
                            Afghans can use it as a basis for discussion. At the same time, the
                            Royal Government of Afghanistan will be informed that additional
                            transportation costs which we expect to range from 10% to 25% will
                            result in a modification of projects to cover that amount.</p>
                        <p>We believe the foregoing course of action will achieve our limited aims
                            and can be defended as prudent.</p>

                        <p>Our aim which is to maintain Afghanistan as an independent buffer state
                            stems not from fondness for the Afghans but rather from the strategic
                            importance of the territory they occupy. The security of our allies,
                            Pakistan and Iran, would be gravely jeopardized should a drastic
                            curtailment of the United States position in Afghanistan result in full
                            Soviet domination of that country. Moreover, there would be implications
                            to the <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0502"/>security of the
                            subcontinent as a whole should this situation develop. Thus, the
                            safeguarding of our investment in Afghanistan's Free World neighbors is
                            a fundamental objective of our Afghan policy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Thwart Soviet Aims</hi></p>
                        <p>Secondly, but of equal importance, we can thwart a major Soviet effort by
                            maintaining an effective position in Afghanistan. We will be
                            demonstrating to the Soviets that the type of operation they have
                            launched in Afghanistan will not be unopposed and will not achieve the
                            results they hope for. To curtail seriously our position in Afghanistan
                            would be a signal to the Soviets that their efforts were succeeding. If
                            we retreated, the Soviets would press forward to fill the vacuum.</p>
                        <p>In short, our efforts to counter Communist encroachment into the
                            subcontinent as evidenced by our aid to India, would be incomplete
                            should we neglect the vital northwestern flank.</p>

                    <p>We are at another crossroads on Afghan policy. State has firmed up its own
                        proposals (attached);<note n="1" xml:id="d241fn1">See the enclosure to <ref
                                target="#d240">Document 240</ref>.</note> which I hope you can read
                        this evening; I suggest we use your 4:30 Friday meeting with <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> to get your views. Dave Bell,

                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GWS1"
                            >Gaud</persName> and I will be present.</p>
                    <p>For years we've been fighting an uphill battle to maintain a competitive
                        presence in Afghanistan vis-à-vis the Soviets. This job has been made doubly
                        difficult by the recurrent <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Afghan
                        clashes over Pushtunistan, e.g. border closings which force us to use the
                        expensive Iranian route.</p>
                    <p>We've been in effect delaying many of our aid projects until the Pakistan
                        route was opened. Since this has failed to move the Afghans, State and
                            <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> now propose that we go ahead with
                        what we can within presently planned levels, but deduct from these any
                        additional charges from use of the Iran route. Thus we'll maintain some
                        pressure on the Afghans, <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0503"/>but at the
                        same time convince them we'll still try to help them (e.g. by building a new
                        $15 million road from Herat to Iran).</p>
                    <p>In effect, this policy seeks to buy more time, in the hope that something
                        will give. State agrees that our investment is not big enough to reverse the
                        adverse trend from creeping Soviet infiltration (at best it only slows this
                        down). But it's just big enough to give the Afghans renewed hope that we
                        will continue to back them regardless of their policy toward Pakistan.
                        Here's the rub—I for one simply doubt that we can help the Afghans enough to
                        maintain an already precarious independence unless they're willing to help
                        themselves by composing their quarrel with Pakistan. We've seen few signs of
                        this; in fact, the Afghans just rejected <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s latest offer (true, it was a pull-back from the
                            <persName corresp="#p_NPM1">Naim</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AM1"
                            >Mohammed Ali</persName> formula).</p>
                    <p>So long as the Afghans think we'll do all we can to help them regardless of
                        their Pushtun policy, they'll have no incentive to yield. Therefore, if past
                        pressures haven't worked, how about a yet tougher line? <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> could go back and say, more in
                        sorrow than in anger, that we want to help but simply can't do so
                        effectively while the border impasse continues. Therefore, while we'll
                        finish existing projects insofar as possible, we can't start any new ones
                        (e.g. Herat road) pending a border opening.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> doubts that this would move
                        the Afghans. But what State proposes seems even less likely to move them.
                        And until the Afghans change their own policy, we'll continue slowly to lose
                        ground. A shift may require <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName>'s
                        removal, but this seems more likely to occur if we don't indulge him than if
                        we do. In short, while I grant that it is more prudent to continue playing
                        for time, I believe you should consider the alternative case.</p>

                        January 21 which President has sent to Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Friend:</p>
                    <p>Since the second round of Kashmir talks has ended as successfully as we could
                        expect, should we not go ahead with the air defense team as scheduled. We
                        will send it on the 24th. Indeed, I see advantage in announcing the visit
                        before the 23 January Indian Parliament debate on the Colombo
                            proposals.<note n="1" xml:id="d243fn1">The Colombo proposals were a set
                            of proposals issued on December 12, 1962, at Colombo, Ceylon, by the
                            Conference of Six Non-Aligned Afro-Asian countries in an effort to
                            promote a peaceful settlement to the border dispute between India and
                            China. The six countries were Burma, Ceylon, Ghana, Indonesia, Cambodia,
                            and the United Arab Republic. For text of the proposals, which called
                            for negotiations with the existing de facto cease-fire as a starting
                            point, see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962, p.
                            1025.</note> Our people are in touch with yours to this end.</p>
                    <p>I am still persuaded that adding to Indian confidence vis-à-vis the Chinese
                        is more likely to help promote a Kashmir settlement than to make the Indians
                        more intransigent. It appears to us that <persName>Nehru</persName> is
                        unlikely to settle Kashmir with too obvious a gun at his back.</p>
                    <p>By the same token, we feel strongly here that Pakistan's rather transparent
                        flirtation with Peiping is harming rather than helping its case. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> may merely be giving the Indians an
                        excuse to argue that to make concessions to the Pakistani would be
                        humiliating under these circumstances. I hope you will join us in persuading
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that if he wants us to help
                        him settle Kashmir, he must refrain from tactics which make it even more of
                        an uphill climb. Above all it seems to us unwise for him to send <persName
                            corresp="#p_AM1">Mohamed Ali</persName> to Peiping at this juncture, and
                        it would seem prudent for us both to tell him so.<note n="2"

                            responded on January 22. He wrote <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> that he concurred in the proposal to announce
                            the dispatch of the air defense team to India, and he agreed that there
                            were dangers in <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s policy of
                            “flirting with the Chinese.” He too felt it was important to emphasize
                            to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that such tactics were
                            harmful to Pakistan's interests, but he did not think that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> could be expected to abandon a
                            border agreement with China that had already been negotiated in

                    <p rend="center">NOTES ON REMARKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL</p>
                    <p>I will start by reviewing areas of policy which will be before us in the
                        coming months and indicate the general attitude which I have toward them and
                        to emphasize where we might put our emphasis in the next few months.</p>
                    <p>[Here follow remarks unrelated to South Asia.]</p>
                    <p>Regarding our attitude toward the neutrals. There is criticism about our lack
                        of difference between the Allies and the neutrals. The Pakistanis are
                        critical, but we must recognize the importance of the Indians. If they
                        joined the Chinese we would have no free South Asia. The Pakistanis are
                        struggling against the Indians and the Afghanistans. They will use or
                        attempt to exploit our power. Our interest is to make a strong
                        sub-continent. We will use the country that can help further that aim. We
                        have used India lately. We do not like their present leadership, but we can
                        use them. While doing this we have moved away from the Pakistanis and they
                        are moving closer to the Chinese and against the Indians. We have not been
                        able to persuade the Pakistanis or the Afghanistans to change their policy
                        on India. These forces were there long before we came on the scene and we
                        cannot do much about it—we cannot settle all the disputes, but we want to
                        keep them free from the Communists. We cannot permit those who call
                        themselves neutrals to be completely taken into the Communist camp. We must
                        keep our ties with Nassir and others, even though we do not like the leaders
                        themselves.</p>

                        Secretary of State signed just before departure. Letter pouched. Text dated
                        January 21 is as follows, unessential words omitted:</p>
                    <p>“My Dear Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>“I regret I could not reply earlier to your letter of 19th November
                            1962,<note n="1" xml:id="d245fn1">See <ref target="#d201fn3">footnote 3,
                                Document 201</ref>.</note> due to numerous preoccupations. These are
                        indeed, as you have rightly stated, troubled and difficult times for all of
                        us.</p>
                    <p>“It is, however, source of relief to us that Cuban crisis has been almost
                        resolved and major threat to world peace has thus been averted. It is my
                        sincere hope that this would contribute to general easing of tensions.</p>
                    <p>“Meanwhile, armed clashes on Sino-Indian border have also, as we anticipated,
                        come to an end. Efforts are now being made by some Afro-Asian nations to
                        enable the two countries to reach peaceful and honorable settlement. We
                        welcome these efforts for we cannot think of an armed conflict between our
                        two mighty neighbors—China and India—which might result in untold bloodshed,
                        cripple their developing economies, disrupt the uneasy equilibrium in this
                        region and even convulse whole world. The interests of world peace demand
                        that far from supplying arms and ammunitions to parties concerned which
                        might lead to resumption of hostilities, every peace-loving nation must
                        exert its legitimate influence to facilitate negotiated settlement between
                        China and India.</p>
                    <p>“You, in your letter, have dealt with Chinese objectives in Sino-Indian
                        dispute. It appears that you seem to view it 'as stepping stone to next
                        objective.' Whatever ultimate objectives of parties concerned may be, we
                        consider that up to present, Sino-Indian dispute is limited to question of
                        their borders.</p>
                    <p>“Our President in his letter of 5th November 1962<note n="2" xml:id="d245fn2"
                            >See <ref target="#d195">Document 195</ref>.</note> to your President
                        has already thrown light on consequences of massive military aid to India.
                        It is our firm conviction that this aid would either be used in resuming
                        hostilities on Sino-Indian border with its enormous repercussions <pb
                            n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0508"/>on all neighboring countries or
                        consequent military build-up in India might well be used against us in
                        absence of Kashmir settlement. You have correctly been informed of adverse
                        public reaction in Pakistan to your assistance to India. I may add that talk
                        in American press concerning $3 billion five-year arms aid program to India
                        has further alarmed people of Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>“I have given thought to assurances contained in your letter that United
                        States military assistance to India will not be used against Pakistan.
                        Government of India, however, appears to be committed to a policy of
                        self-sufficient defense establishment. 'The aid to which we attach greatest
                        importance,' said Minister <persName>Nehru</persName> according to
                        Washington Post, of January 1, 1963, 'is aid which enables us to develop
                        ourselves, to manufacture, to make araments that we need, because that is
                        permanent help in making us self-reliant in that respect … . That means
                        additional machines for our armament factories and our ordnance depots.'
                        Should India be able to acquire such a military capability with foreign
                        assistance, I wonder how any power would be able to restrain her from using
                        output of her own defense establishment in any manner she deems fit. The
                        current United States military aid to India, in above context, is therefore
                        cause of genuine concern to all of us.</p>
                    <p>“I avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm that we attach great
                        importance to our long-standing friendship with United States and our common
                        membership in <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. We are also grateful for assistance we
                        have received from United States. We do believe in you when you say that in
                        recent weeks you have kept in forefront of your minds interests and concerns
                        of Pakistan. I would, nevertheless, in all frankness as desired by you, like
                        to point out that there is genuine fear among our people that your
                        government's preoccupation with Chinese motivations may preclude you in long
                        run to pay adequate attention to vital interests of Pakistan which, it is
                        needless for me to stress, has always given unstinted support to United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>“The need of the hour is that growing military imbalance in subcontinent,
                        caused by United States assistance to India should be redressed. United
                        States must continue to use its influence to facilitate settlement of
                        Kashmir dispute with view to ensuring lasting peace in this region.
                        Pakistan, which embarked on path of modernization rather late, requires
                        extra assistance to maintain her planned economic growth.</p>
                    <p>“Finally I would like to say that I also attach great importance to such
                        exchange of views and personal contacts. Looking forward to meeting you in

                    <p>196. Purpose of this message is to set forth conclusions of full scale review
                        at highest level of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of our policy
                        objectives in Afghanistan and to outline approved course of action designed
                        to achieve these objectives in light of continuing impasse between
                        Afghanistan and Pakistan. This message constitutes your instructions and is
                        basis for your approach to <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> on your
                        return to Kabul.</p>
                    <p>Our aim, which is to maintain Afghanistan as an independent buffer state,
                        stems not from any emotional involvement in Afghanistan's area
                        controversies, but rather from our objective assessment of strategic
                        importance of territory it occupies. Security of those to whom we have
                        security treaty obligations, Pakistan and Iran, would be gravely jeopardized
                        should drastic curtailment of US position in Afghanistan result in full
                        Soviet domination of that country. Moreover, there are implications to
                        security of subcontinent as a whole should this situation develop.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, but of equal importance, we want to thwart major Soviet effort by
                        maintaining an effective competitive position in Afghanistan. We will be
                        demonstrating to Soviets that any plans for monopolistic position in
                        Afghanistan will not escape unchallenged. To curtail seriously our position
                        in Afghanistan would be signal to Soviets that we were abandoning field to
                        them. Our retreat would leave vacuum for them to exploit.</p>
                    <p>Our efforts to counter communist encroachment into subcontinent through
                        economic aid and security arrangements would be incomplete should we neglect
                        vital northwestern flank.</p>
                    <p>Most effective instrument available to maintain an effective US position in
                        Afghanistan is our aid program.</p>
                    <p>We intend therefore to continue our aid program in Afghanistan using Iran
                        route for such time and extent required even though at some additional cost
                        and absorbing such additional transportation costs within currently planned
                        aid levels. We believe this course will at least slow down if not eventually
                        thwart fulfillment of Soviet purposes in Afghanistan. This posture gives us
                        an interval during which more favorable conditions may develop; it could
                        make possible emergence of more moderate government in Afghanistan more
                        allergic to Soviet threat than one now in power. Certainly by retaining an
                        effective position in country <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0510"/>we
                        will strengthen those elements in Afghanistan who wish to continue close
                        ties with West. Additionally, we will have more time to work for a
                        constructive approach from Pakistan which we are prevented from effectively
                        doing at present because of its preoccupation with tension elsewhere in
                        area. This policy decision provides us with best discernible course through
                        which we achieve our objectives, placing us in a positive position from
                        which to operate.</p>
                    <p>Major US project, Kabul-Kandahar road, has come to symbolize US interest and
                        position in Afghanistan. To complete this project will clearly demonstrate
                        US determination to maintain its position in Afghanistan. We intend to
                        complete this project, though to specifications less elaborate than
                        originally planned to minimize additional costs, using route through Iran.
                        To alleviate some of effect of added costs to <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                            >AID</gloss> and to demonstrate to Afghans that their political stance
                        imposes responsibilities on them too, absorption of extra transportation
                        costs out of planned aid levels is considered fair and right.</p>
                    <p>In your presentation manner and method of which we leave to your discretion
                        you should stress our considered judgment that this approach places our
                        relations within framework of understanding where real progress can be made
                        if cooperation characterizes our mutual endeavors. However, you should also
                        point out our continuing belief that Afghan ability to maintain independent
                        position would be greatly enhanced by improvement of relations with
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In addition this approach, while taking into account regrettable area
                        conditions which inhibit our fuller freedom of action, does not allow those
                        conditions to distract us from pursuing objectives which are basic to US
                        interests. <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> should find no difficulty in
                        accepting and appreciating this rationale.</p>
                    <p>Fundamental to foregoing course of action is our conviction that <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> is dedicated to the maintenance of its
                        independence and nonaligned status. Should this prove to be incorrect as
                        evidenced, for example, by <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> complete
                        unresponsiveness to your approach we would be inclined to regard this as an
                        indication that <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> had little intention of,
                        or interest in, maintaining balanced position by continuing effective ties
                        with free world. In these circumstances achievement of our objectives would
                        become remote to point it would be difficult to justify further US
                        investment in Afghanistan and we would be forced to re-examine basis of our
                        relations with Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>There follows immediately in a separate message prepared in <gloss

                    <p>As part of your presentation you are authorized to extend invitation to King
                        and Queen to visit US at convenient time. If it becomes necessary to discuss
                        availability dates you may say that President's schedule tentatively <pb

                                which they already knew were anathema to Peking: (1) Indian troops

                                tells us in confidence Indians will do both unilaterally over time.
                                Indian ploy puts ball neatly back in Peiping's court.</p>
                            <p>Second, when <persName>Nehru</persName> tried to get Congress party

                    <p>We simply doubt Indians would ever give up the Vale, especially if after ten
                        years or so it would revert to Pakistan. Therefore, we've worked out a
                        partition scheme which we're prepared to throw into the breach if talks seem
                        about to break down. It is quite pro-Indian (map attached).<note n="3"

                        March, we must persuade Indians to make some gesture which will be
                        sufficiently forthcoming to convince <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> that <persName>Nehru</persName> is not just stalling.
                        One such would be an Indian proposal in third round talks (12 February)
                        which is more than just a minor adjustment of cease-fire line. Ken is
                        working on this. Another would be a <persName>Nehru</persName> speech
                        arguing that <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat makes <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Indian reconciliation essential, that he is
                        going to accept a compromise Kashmir settlement to this end.</p>
                    <p>If we could only get <persName>Nehru</persName> to make the first move, it
                        would go far towards creating the essential psychological climate without

                    <p>The meeting was at the request of the Pakistani Ambassador who was under
                        instructions to request an appointment with President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to deliver a letter to the
                        President from President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>.
                        Following delivery of the letter, which set forth President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s assessments of the Kashmir talks to
                        date and suggested that the introduction of a United States representative
                        in the parleys might effectively bridge the gap between Pakistan and Indian
                        viewpoints, the Pakistani Ambassador also gave the President a supplemental
                        sheet containing an amplification of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s specific suggestions [3 lines of source text not
                        declassified].</p>
                    <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0514"/>
                    <p>After reading the letter, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> asked what there was in President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s proposals for the Indians given
                        their refusal to consider a plebiscite. The Ambassador briefly reviewed the
                        Kashmir history. He began with <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss>
                        resolutions and went from there to the Dixon and McNaughton proposals. He
                        stated that the Vale was needed more for the defense of Pakistan than for
                        the defense of India and accordingly should be transferred to Pakistan. Also
                        this would free <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> forces to meet the
                        Chinese on other fronts and would meet the wishes of the inhabitants of the
                        Vale.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the Indians now have most of Kashmir, any
                        settlement will call for the Indians to make the concrete concessions, and
                        the real question is how they can be brought to make the difficult and
                        painful concessions which are required. With respect to the second question
                        of United States participation in the negotiations, the President said he
                        would want to get the judgment of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> and others as to the extent this would be useful,
                        and the reaction of the Government of India. He said we did not want to be
                        left holding the bag if negotiations were to fail.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that there had been sufficient progress made in the
                        last round of talks to justify another meeting, but this had been made
                        possible only by the intervention of the United States and the United
                        Kingdom Ambassadors in New Delhi. The Government of India negotiators have
                        been most reluctant, according to the Ambassador, to show their hands and
                        the Pakistani hope is that the introduction of a third party would speed up
                        the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said there was a strong desire among some Indian cabinet
                        members, elements of the Indian public, and the Indian military for a
                        Kashmir settlement. <persName>Nehru</persName>, however, has given no
                        indication of giving in on Kashmir. The Pakistani assessment is that the
                        Indians do not want the talks to break down at this time but will spin them
                        out until they have received sufficient aid from the United States and at
                        that time will settle with the Chinese Communists. It is because of this
                        assessment that Pakistan wants the United States to push the Indians.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he and the Ambassador had talked about this
                        question before. There was disagreement between them on the capacity of the
                        United States to influence other capitals. He said that the United States
                        and Pakistan had been through this on the Afghan-<gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> issue without any settlement (the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> Ambassador interjected at this point that Pakistan had made
                        concessions on this issue). The United States can help bring the parties to
                        the table but has far less influence in bringing about a specific solution.

                    <p>The President closed the session by saying that he would be replying in the
                        next couple of days to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"

                    <p>3098. Delivery following letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName> at earliest appropriate opportunity.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>I've been weighing whether to write you on the subject of Kashmir and am
                        persuaded that a word from me would not be misconstrued at this juncture.
                        Our interest in this subject stems from the same concern for the security of
                        the subcontinent which prompted us to try to be helpful when India found
                        itself under attack from Communist China. Indeed, the US is now so heavily
                        engaged in the effort to assure the economic development and insure the
                        security of the subcontinent, that I hope you regard our interest in this
                        matter as not amiss.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, I will venture to speak frankly on an issue of such moment
                        as Kashmir. We Americans are perhaps too far away to appreciate fully the
                        passions aroused by this painful issue. Perhaps, however, this also gives us
                        perspective to argue that the great issues affecting the subcontinent's
                        future overshadow in significance the differences between India and Pakistan
                        over Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>While the history of this problem, and the antagonisms it has aroused will
                        demand statesmanship of the highest order on both sides to achieve such a
                        settlement, the open Chinese Communist aggression against India seems to
                        have provided a new and pressing reason for its achievement. I hope that
                        this opportunity will not be allowed to pass.</p>
                    <p>What chiefly motivates me to write you are the strong Pakistani allegations,
                        expressed to us in many ways, that India is not serious about negotiating an
                        acceptable compromise settlement. I well realize that the Pakistani may be
                        pressing this point in order to induce the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> to intervene. At the same time, however, it does underline
                        the desirability <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0517"/>of disposing of
                        this argument to the extent it can be done. To this end, I wonder whether
                        some public gesture on India's part placing a Kashmir settlement and
                        Pakistan-Indian reconciliation in the context of the subcontinent's long
                        term need for security and economic development would not help give the
                        negotiations renewed momentum and provide us grounds for urging reciprocal
                        expressions on <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Even more important, it seems to me, would be some concrete Indian proposals
                        in the next round of talks which take sufficient account of their point of
                        view to be proof positive to the Pakistanis that you are genuinely seeking a
                        settlement. I believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> has talked more specifically with you on this.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> told <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that he recognized any viable
                        compromise would be one unpalatable to both parties. I have no doubt that it
                        will be hard for him too to accept a compromise, but I can assure you that
                        we do not intend to support proposals which lean too far to one side.</p>
                    <p>Let me close with a private thought. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> is in a weaker position in his own country than you
                        are, and Pakistan is the lesser power. By these tokens it is harder for him
                        to take the first step toward you than you toward him. I too have repeatedly
                        been forced to accept that more is required of great powers than of others.
                        It is always the weaker who must seem unyielding. Of course, I do not mean
                        in any way to discount the importance of Kashmir to India, or the many
                        factors which make settlement difficult. But the costs of settling Kashmir,
                        great as they are, must seem less in relation to India's larger purposes
                        than they are to Pakistan's. If only this issue could be settled, it would
                        open new perspectives in terms of India's role on the world stage, while
                        eliminating a painful diversion which adversely affects the security of the
                        subcontinent and inevitably complicates US-Indian relations in ways
                        disadvantageous to us both.<note n="1" xml:id="d251fn1">In telegram 3086 to
                            New Delhi, February 5, the Department informed the Embassy that
                                <persName>Senator J. William Fulbright</persName>, Chairman of the
                            Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was disturbed by the prospect of an
                            increased program of arms aid to India before settlement of the Kashmir
                            dispute was agreed upon. Without such a settlement, Fulbright was
                            concerned that an enhanced military capability might lead India to
                            attempt to compensate for any losses suffered in the border war with
                            China at the expense of Pakistan. (Ibid., DEF 19-3 US-INDIA)</note></p>
                    <p>I hope that you will not mind my frankness in this matter. I have been so

                        feeling that your personal role will be vital to the resolution of this

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: President <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> has asked me to transmit to you the
                        following message under the date of February 6, 1963:</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>“I hasten to reply to your letter of January 26,<note n="1" xml:id="d252fn1"
                            >See <ref target="#d250fn2">footnote 2, Document 250</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>“[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (3-1/2 lines of source text) not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>“[<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. Indeed
                        any settlement achievable at this juncture must in some way get around the
                        basic irreconcilability of the present Indian and Pakistani positions on the
                        Valley.</p>
                    <p>“However difficult this may be, I must say in all candor that I doubt there
                        will ever be a better opportunity than this one. Whether or not the Chinese
                        Communist attack on India is over for the time being, the threat remains and
                        has had a profoundly sobering effect on India. It has led the Indian
                        Government to realize the importance of a reconciliation with Pakistan and
                        to embark upon talks to this end. While the Indians have not yet shown their
                        hand there are indications that they genuinely desire a compromise
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>“India's desire for <gloss target="#t_UN1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> military aid is also an incentive, since we have made clear
                        to the Indians that their attitude toward Pakistan must inevitably be a
                        factor in our long-term military aid plans. However, if the threat increases
                        or Sino-Indian fighting flares up once more, we may again be faced with the
                        problem of providing India with substantial help.</p>
                    <p>“If India is forthcoming in further talks, it would appear to be greatly in
                        your interest to respond in the same sense. I recall your prescient remark
                        to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that any
                        settlement will be highly unpalatable to many on both sides. For either side
                        to fail to recognize this essential fact would simply foreclose the
                        possibility of fruitful negotiations, and it is difficult to see how or when
                        they could be reopened under as favorable circumstances. Certainly recourse
                        again to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would accomplish little.
                        Thus, however I look at the problem, I am driven to the conclusion that
                        Pakistan should make every possible effort to achieve a compromise
                        settlement now.</p>
                    <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>“I can assure you that the United States will do everything it can, within
                        the limits of what we conceive to be helpful in bringing about such a
                        settlement. We have, as you know, not been idle up to this point. But, after
                        surveying the matter [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>], we do not believe the current circumstances are such
                        that a direct U.S. role in the talks would be productive. I think we can be
                        more helpful behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>“My sincere hope is that during the next round of talks in Karachi both
                        parties will get down to considering the possibilities for an international
                        boundary running through Kashmir. This can only be achieved through
                        substantial compromises of present positions. Even if this goal proves
                        impossible to achieve in the third round, it would seem essential at a
                        minimum to fix an agreed date in the near future for a fourth round of talks
                        lest the crucial momentum of the negotiation be lost.</p>
                    <p>“You are quite right about my deep personal interest in resolving this thorny
                        and long standing dispute. Yet I fear that you overstate my influence if you
                        think that it alone can be decisive. The United States and the United
                        Kingdom cannot force a solution on either India or Pakistan. Our influence
                        can only help weight the balance if statesmanship on both sides has brought
                        matters to the point where the gap remaining between the two parties is
                        sufficiently narrow that third-party efforts have some hope of success. We
                        are far from that point as yet, but I am hopeful that it will be possible
                        from the current talks to bring about the settlement which we all
                        desire.</p>

                            from us India led off with an offer which included limited but
                            significant concessions to Pakistan beyond the cease-fire line. This
                            offer suggests that the Indians may be willing to begin bargaining on a
                            Kashmir settlement based on territorial division, including the
                            Vale.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan replied with a proposal which would give Pakistan all of Kashmir
                            (including the Vale, Ladakh and even certain Hindu majority areas)
                            except a part of Jammu in the south. This seems to us to be an extreme
                            initial position from which we would expect the Pakistanis to move
                            during later bargaining. Since the Pakistani proposal gives all of the
                            Vale to Pakistan, it provides no clues as to whether or not Pakistan
                            will abandon its insistence on temporary internationalization followed
                            by some sort of plebiscite.</p>
                        <p>Our role has become somewhat more active, although we have neither become
                            a party to the talks nor introduced specific proposals. Before the third
                            round, we decided that our best immediate tactic was to urge both
                            parties to seek a settlement by partition, and to speed the bargaining
                            process by making concessions. Although the British believe
                            internationalization of the Vale must ultimately be considered, we
                            persuaded them to go along with our tactics. Our joint efforts with the
                            Indians and Pakistanis both before and during the talks seem to have
                            produced some results. We are now tentatively planning similar efforts
                            prior to the fourth round, designed to produce a new agreed course of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>We continue to believe that with active pressure from the British and
                            ourselves, bilateral talks can produce additional progress. While we
                            believe partition offers the best prospect for a Kashmir settlement, we
                            are keeping our minds open to various possible forms of
                            internationalization.</p>
                        <p>We believe that while the most difficult stages of the negotiations are
                            still ahead, there is a sporting chance they will ultimately succeed.
                            The immediate hurdle is the next round during which both sides will be
                            subject to pressures generated in the national legislatures of both
                            countries, which will be in session at the time. If the talks can be
                            kept moving through this round and progress further in later
                            discussions, we foresee a situation in which the British and ourselves
                            might submit a proposal for a settlement with some chance for
                            acceptance.</p>

                            that the team's leaders stop briefly in Karachi to obtain Pakistan's
                            assessment of the Chinese Communist air threat. We also think the team
                            leaders should be prepared generally to discuss air defense requirements
                            for the subcontinent should a need similar to that in India arise in
                            Pakistan. We hope to get this squared away in the next few days after we

                    <p>3181. Here are our thoughts regarding tactics for fourth round Kashmir talks
                        in Calcutta. These are based on study your excellent analyses as well as
                        impressions brought back by <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> and
                            Jackson.<note n="1" xml:id="d254fn1">Elmore Jackson, Special Assistant
                            for U.N. Planning in <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and an expert on
                            the Kashmir issue.</note> You should comment urgently so we have time to
                        coordinate with British and get our lines straight long enough before next
                        round to enable us step up our input.</p>
                    <p>We view talks as having progressed logically, if somewhat slowly. Indians and
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s sloughed off traditional positions
                        at first round, agreed on certain principles in second, got down to maps in
                        third. We agree with Karachi, however, that parties have yet to come to
                        grips with hard realities. Indians have failed so far to signal disposition
                        to divide Vale, and <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s have reserved
                        position on tough choice between an internationalization formula which
                        Indians probably would reject and territorial division plan which would be
                        politically risky for them.</p>
                    <p>Looking toward round at Calcutta we see two problems. First relates to
                        bargaining positions both sides. Indian proposal at Karachi was step forward
                        which seemed invite <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s into market place.
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s responded with such an inadequate
                        offer that we might have expected Indians to turn it down out of hand.
                        Instead it has probably been left over for final disposition at Calcutta
                        where Indians seem likely start off by complete rejection <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> line. Problem then will be how to get talks
                        moving again. We believe burden will and should be on <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s to restore movement by making a business
                        offer.</p>
                    <p>This gets us to second problem. We are perplexed by timing Calcutta talks.
                        Pressures on negotiators which may be generated in Lok Sabha and National
                        Assembly seem likely increase difficulties of compromise already evident in
                        press reactions from both sides, particularly in Pakistan. Task therefore is
                        to avoid impasse stimulated by political pressures and produce achievement
                        adequate to justify continuation talks.</p>
                    <p>It is our judgment that <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s are unlikely to
                        give serious consideration to proposal for partition of Vale until they have
                        introduced their idea of internationalization and had it discussed
                        seriously. If this analysis correct, we see advantage <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> internationalization idea coming in <pb
                            n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0525"/>promptly in fourth round. This
                        would have double advantage getting this proposal aired and letting <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s face and cope with Indian objections and
                        its introduction might ease <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> public
                        opinion problem. It will not be enough, however, for <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s to talk of vague idea of internationalization. They must
                        get down to specific, carefully thought out formula if it is to serve as
                        basis for useful discussion.</p>
                    <p>If our judgment of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> intentions is correct,
                        we will have to prepare Indians to give fair hearing to internationalization
                        proposal. Providing such proposal includes realistic lines north and south
                        of Vale, discussion of it might serve purpose keeping bargaining going
                        during difficult period when legislatures in session. To counter <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> internationalization proposal, we would
                        hope Indians might come up with refined proposal for territorial division
                        giving <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s substantial position in Vale and
                        incorporating functional arrangements which, as Delhi points out, would
                        divide Vale without denying it to people on either side. We recognize,
                        however, that they may have other ideas about counter proposal at this
                        stage. Such an exchange would give us opportunity throw in more detailed
                        ideas before and during fourth round on functional arrangements. Also it
                        could lay foundations for circumstances in which ultimately we might, if
                        necessary, make proposal cloaked as combination territorial division and
                        internationalization.</p>
                    <p>Obviously scenario like this calls for increased US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"

                                    >Pak</gloss>s must make first substantial move in next round. We
                                believe that settlement can be achieved only through agreeing upon
                                international boundary running through Kashmir. But if, as we
                                expect, <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s insist they can't go
                                beyond Shahi's “fall back” position, we should emphasize that they
                                must make some negotiable proposal. Although we believe
                                internationalization is not route towards solution, it would be
                                better for <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s to table it than
                                drawing another unsatisfactory line, provided proposal includes

                                        than they have ever been, but that if this opportunity is

                                dispute which would leave the Valley with India without any form of

                            to make it clear that if Ladakh (which has a 79% Muslim majority) came
                            to Pakistan (as under any equitable settlement it would), the Pakistan
                            Government would naturally assume full responsibility for its defence

                        We also need your general approval of the form and extent of leverage we'll
                        need to apply.</p>
                    <p>Attached is a State paper addressed to these issues. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>'s people think we may be able to get
                        through one or two more rounds before we have to start real arm twisting. I
                        feel that we had better start weighing in harder now, lest the talks lose
                        momentum, though holding off on precise proposals if possible till after the
                        fourth round. And since we, not the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, are
                        the only ones with real leverage, and both sides are in fact looking to us,
                        we ought not to try to stay a half step behind the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The alternative would be to plug for one or two more rounds, but to begin
                        disengaging if there is insufficient progress, and neither advance our own
                        solution (which will inevitably outrage the side adversely affected) nor use
                        forms of pressure which risk serious damage to our relations with India or
                        Pakistan. Moreover, there's no point in signing on to a real effort unless
                        we're willing to go the distance. Injecting ourselves directly into this
                        dispute will buy us trouble with both sides, and plenty of flak from the
                        Hill. Since at best we've got only a 50-50 chance of pulling it off, we may
                        end up with a failure to boot.</p>
                    <p>But we're unlikely ever to have a better chance to settle Kashmir on other
                        than the status quo, and a hard try seems well worth the risks. If you
                        agree, then aside from approving State's recommendations, I'd urge you
                        ginger up State by: (1) telling them you want every effort made to bring off
                        a settlement; (2) explicitly authorizing a hard sell to <persName

                        warnings that we may be unable to back him if he goes to the GA and that
                        we'll have to go ahead with military aid to India.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of your meeting at 5:00 o'clock Thursday is to decide on
                            future Kashmir strategy. We have reached the point where further real
                            progress is unlikely without increased United States involvement; even
                            with it, a settlement is not a sure thing. Whether we should invest the
                            necessary extra effort, and what leverage we should use are major
                            questions on which we need your views.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. The Talks So Far.</hi></p>
                        <p>[Here follows a two-page assessment of the progress of and prospects for
                            the Ministerial talks, which is similar to the assessment contained in
                            the attachment to Document 253. The Department of State assessment is
                            somewhat more pessimistic than that produced by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Subcommittee, but still concludes that
                            “there is a fair chance for a settlement.”]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Leverage Available To Us.</hi></p>
                        <p>In India our usable leverage is primarily related to our military aid.
                            The Indians already seem well aware of the link between it and Kashmir.
                            This impression will be intensified as we get more into the aid season.
                            The danger is, however, that if we overplay our hand, the Indians may
                            conclude that the cost of military assistance, in terms of concessions
                            in <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0532"/>Kashmir, is so great as to
                            make it necessary to seek peace with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>We might also link our economic assistance with Kashmir. This would
                            increase the pressures for settlement but, if the Indians failed to
                            respond and we cut aid, the economic and political consequences within
                            India would be serious.</p>
                        <p>In Pakistan we could also tie military and economic aid to Kashmir. If we
                            did this with military aid we would be resiling from outstanding
                            commitments to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and if we did
                            it with economic aid the same objection as in India would apply. Also we
                            can warn <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that the United
                            States will continue to build Indian military strength if the Kashmir
                            negotiations fail because of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                            intransigence. Further, we can tell him that this is his best
                            opportunity for a Kashmir settlement and the United States and United
                            Kingdom will not support him in any other <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                >Pak</gloss> moves on Kashmir (e.g., UNGA). If we carry any of these
                            tactics too far, however, we may either force <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to accept a Kashmir compromise
                            which he cannot sell at home, or put ourselves in the position of having
                            further weakened his political position.</p>

                                Action.</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">a. For Fourth Round</hi></p>
                        <p>Our involvement in the talks has steadily increased and we believe it
                            should continue to do so. So far we have done a great deal of prodding
                            and some stage managing. At each round our Ambassadors have been
                            credited by one party or the other with “saving” the talks. We plan to
                            continue our prodding (e.g. further Presidential correspondence) and
                            begin making substantive suggestions to both sides regarding aspects of
                            possible solutions (e.g. functional arrangements to mitigate partition
                            of Vale). We would not now offer an integrated proposal for settlement.
                            We plan, however, to authorize our Ambassadors, if necessary to save the
                            talks, to urge the negotiators at Calcutta to schedule a fifth round to
                            consider such a United States-United Kingdom proposal. We will
                            coordinate the details of these tactics with the British early next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>In India we propose to continue our efforts to insure that the wide range
                            of Indian leaders who can influence <persName>Nehru</persName> are aware
                            of the relationship between United States capacity to aid India
                            militarily and a Kashmir settlement. We would not similarly link
                            economic aid, but we propose to warn Indian leaders that Congressional
                            attitudes on such aid are certain to be affected by India's approach to
                            the Kashmir talks.</p>
                        <p>In Pakistan we propose to remind <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> that we see no prospect of any better result for
                            him than a genuine compromise, and make clear to him our determination
                            to continue military aid to India if Pakistan obstructs the way to a
                            Kashmir settlement. We plan also to signal that we <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0533"/>will not in the future take an active
                            role in support of other <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> moves on
                            Kashmir if Pakistan is not forthcoming in these talks.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">b. After Fourth Round</hi></p>
                        <p>In any event, we are prepared to put forward a proposal some time after
                            the fourth round if further bilateral progress seems unlikely, with
                            exact timing dependent upon progress in future rounds of bilateral
                            talks. We are now refining such a formula for possible future use, but
                            its exact content will depend greatly upon the direction in which the
                            bilateral negotiators have moved. Our formula calls for special joint
                                Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> arrangements in the Vale
                            while reserving to each party respective areas of political control in
                            the Vale and elsewhere in Kashmir.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">6. Implications of This Course and
                                Risk of Failure.</hi></p>
                        <p>We are gradually moving toward a degree of involvement in the talks which
                            may vitally affect our relationships with India and Pakistan. While the
                            benefits of success would be great, the cost of failure should be
                            considered. If we tie the extent of military aid to India to a
                            settlement—and we have already done so to a large degree—failure will
                            affect this important component of our relationship. Should India appear
                            responsible for failure, its reputation on the Hill and elsewhere would
                            greatly suffer, complicating our already difficult tasks. If we push
                            Pakistan hard without result, we may damage relations with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and weaken his political position
                            at home. Even if we abandoned our efforts now, some of these same
                            effects would be felt. Yet with further U.S.-U.K. involvement, they
                            could become more severe.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if a settlement is achieved, the prospects for the
                            future of the subcontinent—and our relations with both countries in
                            it—are immeasurably brightened. Furthermore, even a failure could, if
                            the effort had resulted in a narrowing of the gap between them, be used
                            to demonstrate to Congress that an honest effort had been made on both
                            sides and that neither party should be penalized.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">7. Recommendations.</hi></p>
                        <p>We are asking at this time for your specific approval of our stepping up
                            our prodding and advancing certain substantive ideas about possible
                            solutions. We also request your approval of our proposals for use of
                            leverage as set forth in Section 5. We think we see our way clear
                            through the fourth round of talks and perhaps to the fifth. You should
                            know that this course, unless deliberately interrupted, will almost
                            inevitably lead to a greater U.S. commitment. This is bound to raise
                            fundamental questions concerning our relations with India and Pakistan
                            (See Section 5). Failure to achieve a settlement may seriously damage
                            those relations at a time when the Chinese Communist threat is likely to
                            require closer cooperation between us and the nations of the
                            subcontinent. We therefore ask <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"

                            <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> replied that this was our
                        staff suggestion of a line of possible settlement. We were now inclined to
                        move the line somewhat to the right, in favor of Pakistan, but at any rate
                        we were not planning to make a proposal at present. The talks were
                        continuing on a bilateral basis.</p>
                    <p>Continuing his presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>
                        said that the latest letters on Kashmir from both <persName corresp="#p_AA1"
                            >Aziz Ahmed</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName> were quite
                        negative. Nevertheless, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> believes India can be moved to give Pakistan a
                        reasonable foothold in the Vale. On the other hand, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> feels that the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s are not inclined to seek a settlement and
                        he finds their position extremely rigid. Nevertheless, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName><pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509"
                            facs="0535"/>explained, we believe there is a fair chance we can move
                        the parties to a compromise. We believe the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s may come up with a proposal for internationalization or
                        autonomy in the fourth round. It is just as well that these be considered so
                        that the parties may then move on to drawing lines on maps in future
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> pointed out that we believe
                        the stakes are high enough to justify an increase in our involvement in the
                        talks. We wished the President's authority to step up our activities from
                        prodding both parties to making certain substantive suggestions regarding
                        aspects of possible solutions. We proposed to begin this prior to the fourth
                        round.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that he had recently written letters to both
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName>. Did we think there was a
                        need for him to do so again? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> said he believed there would be such a need before
                        the next talks, but not right away.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> described our coordination
                        of our Kashmir tactics with the British prior to the third round of talks
                        and our plans for similar coordination prior to the fourth.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary intervened at this point to explain to the President that the
                        major problem we may face in the fourth round is how to get through to the
                        fifth. In view of the political pressures which are likely to be generated
                        by both national legislatures, it will be difficult to make any major
                        progress at Calcutta. There could be greater progress at the fifth round
                        which might be held in April. The Secretary also pointed out that the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s had offered virtually nothing when they
                        put in their line at Karachi. Our efforts at present, therefore, must be
                        concentrated on getting the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s to be more
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>The President then commented rather wryly that if Pakistan doesn't come
                        through with a better compromise offer, it will probably try to blackmail us
                        into holding off on aid to India.</p>
                    <p>It was to deal with this problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW1"
                            >Komer</persName> explained, that we proposed to make clear to Pakistan
                        that if the Kashmir talks failed because of <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> intransigence, we would not feel obligated to work out our
                        military assistance to India in consultation with Pakistan. Speculating on
                        other <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> moves, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> said that they may be thinking of
                        taking the Kashmir issue to the Security Council this fall and, following a
                        Soviet veto, raise it in the General Assembly. We believe Zafrullah's recent
                        tour may have been intended to sound out Afro-Asian opinion with this move
                        in mind. In order to deal with this eventuality, we propose to tell the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s in advance that if the talks fail
                        because of their intransigence, we would not support them in the U.N. this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed the view that to say this would simply annoy the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. They knew perfectly well that they
                        could get nowhere in the U.N. on Kashmir.</p>
                    <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0536"/>
                    <p>The President then turned his attention again to the map, and, in particular,
                        the dividing line which the Department has suggested as a possible basis for
                        settlement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> said that this
                        line represented the most we thought the Indians might give up, since a
                        settlement would depend on Indian concessions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> then brought his
                        presentation to a close with a brief review of our complete formula for a
                        settlement, which, he said, would call for special joint Indo-<gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> arrangements in the Vale while reserving to
                        each party respective areas of political control in the Vale and elsewhere
                        in Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>As the discussion came to a close, the President asked if we were suggesting
                        some immediate communication or letter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> replied that our request was for him to authorize us
                        to step up our involvement in the Kashmir negotiations. The Secretary
                        remarked, we were asking permission to get in from up to our ankles to up to
                        our knees.</p>
                    <p>The President gave his approval.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary told the Ambassador that we are worried about a Kashmir
                        settlement. It looks to us as if things were getting more difficult. We had
                        sensed some movement during the third round in Karachi on the part of India,
                        but the Pakistan proposals had not seemed to us to provide <pb n="511"
                            xml:id="pg_511" facs="0537"/>a basis for further negotiation. Now,
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s visit to
                            Peking<note n="1" xml:id="d259fn1">The Embassy in Karachi was informed
                            on February 22 by the Foreign Ministry that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                                >Bhutto</persName> intended to travel to Peking on February 24 to
                            sign the border agreement with China which had been presaged by the
                            agreement in principle signed by the two countries on December 26, 1962.
                            (Telegram 1603 from Karachi, February 22; ibid., <gloss target="#t_pol1"
                                >POL</gloss> 32-2 <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">CHICOM</gloss>-<gloss
                                target="#t_Pak1">PAK</gloss>) The border agreement, which delineated
                            the border between Pakistan and China's Sinkiang province, was signed in
                            Peking on March 2 by <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and
                            China's Foreign Minister Chen Yi. (Telegram 1654 from Karachi, March 5;
                            ibid.)</note> made things more difficult. The Secretary wondered how
                        Pakistan viewed the picture—had there been any agonizing reappraisals in
                        Rawalpindi? He added that, viewing the Kashmir question from a vantage point
                        12,000 miles away, there was a tantalizing aspect to it. This was that both
                        sides approached the Kashmir issue as enemies, but the issue itself was the
                        only thing that made them enemies. This differentiates the Kashmir issue
                        from such issues as Berlin and Cuba.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador began by stating his Government's position on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> visit. He had reported our
                        objections to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and to President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. These had been considered
                        and the proposal to have the Pakistan Ambassador in Peking sign the
                        agreement had been made to the Communist Chinese. They refused to agree,
                        pointing out that the Nepalese and Burmese border agreements with China had
                        been signed by the King and the Prime Minister respectively, and insisted
                        that at least the Foreign Minister sign the Pakistan one. Pakistan was
                        playing down the importance of the trip—the delegation consisted of only
                        four men who would only spend three days in Peking and one in Shanghai
                        before returning to Pakistan. In any case, India should not read too much
                        either into the fact that the Foreign Minister was going, or into the
                        substance of the agreement itself. Pakistan feels it has acted wisely. The
                        border agreement is provisional and does not prejudice India's
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that if he were the Communist Chinese Foreign Minister in
                        Peking, his primary policy objective would be to wreck the Kashmir talks. It
                        seemed to us that the contrived way these announcements about the border
                        agreement had been made indicated that the Communist Chinese were actively
                        using their relations with Pakistan to achieve this objective. The Secretary
                        said he was not viewing the Sino-Pakistan agreement against the background
                        of better than a decade of bitter Sino-United States relations. Rather, he
                        was viewing the agreement as something which Pakistan, a close friend of the
                        United States, was doing which, in the context of the total situation in the
                        subcontinent, might be very harmful to the fourth round of Kashmir
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> reiterated that they
                        had tried to call off <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s visit
                        but could not. He added once again that the Indians were being too
                        sensitive.</p>
                    <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0538"/>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that Pakistan has asked us in the past to influence
                        the Indians on Kashmir. We have been working hard on getting the two sides
                        together. Perhaps the Indians should not get upset by Pakistan's action, but
                        the fact remains that they are. This puts an additional burden on us in a
                        situation where our influence is already limited.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then turned to the Pakistan position on Kashmir. This, he
                        said, had been stated in President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s last letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> and amplified in his own letter to the Secretary of
                        February 18. It represented the farthest limit <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> could go consonant with public opinion in Pakistan.
                        Pakistan continues to believe the best solution is a plebiscite, or, at
                        least, the Dixon [Sir <persName>Owen</persName>]<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2"
                            >Brackets in the source text.</note> proposal for a limited plebiscite
                        with partition. India says it cannot accept either of these for security
                        reasons—i.e., India needs to maintain military supply routes through the
                        Vale for the defense of Ladakh.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the Ambassador digressed from the subject of Kashmir and dwelt
                        on military affairs. He said that intelligence reports coming to Pakistan
                        indicated that the Indian military wanted to get rid of Ladakh as a military
                        liability. If Pakistan took on the responsibility for the defense of Ladakh,
                        it would result in a real joint defense of the subcontinent—i.e., Pakistan
                        would defend the western flank, consisting of Kashmir and Ladakh, and India
                        would defend <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss>. This arrangement would
                        also provide for the disengagement of Pakistan and Indian forces so vital to
                        a workable settlement. Other settlements would not permit Pakistan to
                        disengage because Pakistan suspicions of Indian intentions would be kept
                        alive by the presence of Indian military forces on Pakistan's flank. The
                        Ambassador said that, the merits of the Kashmir dispute aside, Pakistan
                        believed the concept of Indian responsibility for the defense of <gloss
                            target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> and Pakistan responsibility for Ladakh
                        and Kashmir was a good strategic one. If the United States agrees, Pakistan
                        thinks rightness of concept should be emphasized with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the Kashmir issue itself, the Ambassador said that the Pakistan
                        position contained in his letter to the Secretary of February 18
                        demonstrated a desire to be reasonable, since India's security concerns in
                        Ladakh were taken into account. This position has not yet been imparted to
                        the Indians, unless the United States had told them. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> said we had not. The Ambassador said
                        that even this position would be hard to sell in Pakistan, but <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> believed he could sell it.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that from a strictly U.S. national point of view, we do
                        not care what sort of a solution is arrived at in Kashmir. We are interested
                        in it only because it is an unsolved problem which affects our other
                        interests because it perpetuates the confrontation of Pakistan and Indian
                            <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0539"/>forces. The solution is really
                        up to India and Pakistan. However, it seemed clear to us that India will not
                        give up Ladakh. He wondered whether it would not be useful to try to find an
                        acceptable political line outside the Vale taking the Indian view into more
                        account than was done at Karachi. He realized that one can never say last
                        chance in diplomacy, but he did consider that if Kashmir was not settled
                        now, the situation would become more serious all around, and we would all be
                        set back farther.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary continued that, for example, a breakdown in the Kashmir talks
                        would be welcomed in Peking as an invitation for more adventures in a
                        disunited subcontinent. Then we and India's Commonwealth friends would feel
                        compelled to provide India with further military assistance. This would
                        inevitably have repercussions in Pakistan because the military balance would
                        be upset.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said he agreed the Chinese Communists would not like to see a
                        Kashmir settlement, but wondered if <persName>Nehru</persName> realized
                        this. The Secretary said that in his opinion <persName>Nehru</persName>'s
                        ideas on Kashmir were involved with considerations that go far beyond
                        whatever interests Peking (or Moscow) may have in the issue. The Ambassador
                        wondered whether <persName>Nehru</persName> can afford to be sentimental on
                        the issue. He believed a more realistic point of view was necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that we urge utter realism on both sides. Kashmir is the
                        number one problem. Perhaps the Chinese Communist involvement with Pakistan
                        had elevated <persName>Nehru</persName>'s concern. The Ambassador said
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> was the biggest stumbling block. Pakistan
                        believed that many other elements in India wanted a reasonable settlement.
                        The Secretary said that if Pakistan was in touch with these elements in
                        India, he would expect that Pakistan would be aware of the lack of appeal
                        its Karachi proposals had. The Ambassador said that his Government had
                        decided not to table at Karachi the plan mentioned in his letter to the
                        Secretary of February 18. Perhaps Indian leaders would be more reasonable if
                        they could learn the details of this plan.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he wanted to get a precise understanding of this plan. We
                        gathered that it meant partition outside of the Vale and Ladakh now, and
                        then a later transfer of Ladakh and the Vale to Pakistan. The Ambassador
                        said that our understanding was correct. He said that the United States
                        should understand that Pakistan and India public opinion on Kashmir were
                        different. Pakistan has a grievance—India does not. Pakistan feels it has
                        been cheated out of what is its rightful territory. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> has to deal with this public opinion,
                        but has gone farther than any other Pakistan government before him has ever
                        dared to go. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> feels he can
                        prepare the public for a later transfer of Ladakh and the Vale, but if India
                        wants more, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> would not be able to
                        convince the Pakistan people.</p>
                    <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0540"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the Pakistan position was firm, and that <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> intended not to agree to a fifth
                        round after Calcutta unless the Indians were more forthcoming than simply
                        presenting minor adjustments to the cease-fire line. The Secretary said that
                        Pakistan's line on the map presented at Karachi was much more unrealistic
                        than was the Indian line.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary went on to say that the stakes were too high to break off the
                        discussions, and continued effort must be made on both sides. A failure at
                        this point would be serious. The Ambassador agreed, but said effort had to
                        come equally from India. He believes the <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> offer is reasonable and that Pakistan is prepared to
                        wait for Ladakh and the Vale. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> asked how long Pakistan would wait. The Ambassador
                        said that within a year there would be evidence of recrudescence of Chinese
                        Communist aggression if there was to be any, which Pakistan doubted. The
                        Ambassador said that Pakistan would do its best to see that the talks do not
                        fail. Pakistan was anxious that the United States and India understood
                        this.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then reverted to the question of the attitude of the Indian
                        Army towards Ladakh, and wondered whether we had had any intelligence
                        reports that the Indian Army considered it a liability. The Secretary
                        replied that we had no evidence of this nature.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked why Pakistan and Indian forces could not disengage
                        in connection with a settlement that gave Ladakh to India. The Ambassador
                        said that the answer to this goes to the root of the problem. Pakistan feels
                        that India has not accepted the fact of its existence, and that if India
                        kept an army in Kashmir ostensibly to defend Ladakh, that army would
                        constitute a threat to Pakistan which it could not disregard. Thus, the
                        settlement would be meaningless.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> said that the Pakistan
                        proposals do not have enough in them to make negotiations towards a
                        settlement possible. Pakistan must be more forthcoming or there will be no
                        settlement. The Ambassador said that he would communicate this to his
                        government but that he was afraid the Pakistan position would be firmer
                        rather than more forthcoming at Calcutta. He sensed a hardening of the
                        Pakistan attitude. Speaking personally he had been surprised that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had gone as far as he had in the
                        proposal on the Vale and Ladakh. It would be hard to explain to the Pakistan
                        people, and this is why there had been so much furore over the Welles Hangen
                        business. The Hangen broadcast could be construed to give away more of the
                        Pakistan position than was desirable.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that the Pakistan position allowing for only one year
                        delay in transferring the Vale and Ladakh to Pakistan was really no position
                        at all—the year would be consumed by the administrative arrangements. The
                        Ambassador said that the year would provide the answer to a disagreement
                        between India and Pakistan about the immediate <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515"
                            facs="0541"/>Chinese Communist threat in Ladakh. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> does not believe it a live threat, the
                        Indians do. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> therefore is willing
                        to wait a year to see if the threat materializes.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary emphasized again the importance of the next round to both
                        sides. He said that if the talks failed because of Pakistan, the sympathy
                        that Pakistan has enjoyed from other governments on Kashmir in the United
                        Nations and elsewhere would be dissipated, and these governments would relax
                        into indifference. The Secretary recalled that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> had said to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> that any workable settlement would be hard to
                        accept in both countries. The Ambassador said that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had sent a clarification of this
                        statement dealing with the interests of the people involved in any
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> expressed
                        the hope that the United States and Pakistan could keep in continuous and
                        close communication on the Kashmir issue.</p>

                        intelligence requirements are essential, but he would like a political and
                        military appraisal as well, and I suggest that an informal and prompt report
                        be coordinated by the Department of State. If there is a prospect of the

                    <p>The waning prospects for a Kashmir settlement have been further dimmed by (1)
                        Pakistan's border agreement with Peiping, which has given India a new excuse
                        for stalling; and (2) Pakistan's still adamant refusal to consider any form

                    <p>The British agreed not to toss in internationalization at this point, but we
                        believe they still see it as the preferred solution, and suspect that they
                        may have talked about it with the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s.
                        Since the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> idea involves some form of

                        they can try it out at some point and get an Indian turn-down. Then we can
                        get back to talking partition.</p>

                        is really bargaining tactics and how much a feeling on <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s part that public opinion will not
                        accept partition at this point or that by waiting until
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> dies, the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                        >Pak</gloss>s can get a better deal. We are trying to disabuse the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s on the latter score.</p>
                    <p>We could probably get a fifth or even sixth round of talks. Since these
                        highly publicized ministerial rounds sharply restrict maneuverability of the
                        negotiators, however, we are looking for a way to get private talks going
                        instead, with the ministerial sessions coming at much longer intervals.</p>
                    <p>The odds are increasingly against an early Kashmir settlement, but we must
                        play out the hand. At the minimum we must get the Indians to be sufficiently
                        forthcoming that the failure can be attributed to Pakistan. If this is the
                        case, it should ease our problem on going ahead with aid to India. The
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s will no doubt be unhappy, but at
                        least we'll be able to counter that we made a real effort to get India to
                        come to terms.</p>

                    <p>3432. Department Pass White House and Defense. We continue to have a serious
                        problem here of keeping Indians moving on Kashmir, firm on China and
                        threading our way between Pakistan baiters, anti-American and other local
                        thickets. The Menonites and fellow travellers are working very hard for a
                        comeback. They are naturally discontented with the way Indian public opinion
                        has moved toward the West in recent months and would like to neutralize the
                        anti-communist and anti-Chinese reaction.</p>
                    <p>This group has a potentially very dangerous argument that the US responded
                        promptly enough with the help when the Chinese came last fall but now we are
                        subordinating Indian aid to domestic considerations, our fear of arousing
                        the Pakistanis and other adverse factors. It follows that India need not
                        pursue an active Pakistan policy for she is not going to get much help
                        anyway. There is further danger of a realpolitik argument that Americans
                        being largely indifferent, India had better make up with the Chinese along
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> lines.</p>
                    <p>As you will be aware, I have been meeting these arguments with considerable
                        energy and some success. But given the state of Indian alarm over the
                        Chinese there is a feeling that we are being very studious and deliberate.
                        This was reflected, as these things always are, in
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s comment this time to Chalmers Roberts.
                        Accordingly, it is very important that we have rapid movement on the air
                        defense matter. Most immediately if I could indicate the prospect of a
                        fairly prompt response, I would be in a far stronger position in pressing at
                        Calcutta on Kashmir. “You must uphold our hand at this juncture while we are
                        getting you air support.” I have just been over the intelligence data and it
                        seems clear that the danger of air operations from Tibet is not large.
                        Accordingly, in accepting some commitment to support the Indians against
                        Chinese air attack we are not running an appreciable risk. At the same time,
                        the supporting effect here will be perfectly enormous. Particularly after
                        this <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> trip to Peking I need
                        something to work on. Note also value of example to those who seek to move
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of successful movement of <gloss

                            >Ayub</persName> at earliest opportunity.</p>
                    <p>March 9, 1963</p>
                    <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I must tell you of my concern over the turn of events between the third and
                        fourth rounds of the Kashmir talks. As you know, we and the United Kingdom
                        pressed for these talks at Pakistan's urging. We have done our best to get
                        talks started and to keep them going. Indeed, I have gained confidence that
                        we are on the right track from the fact that your government has repeatedly
                        expressed its appreciation for our efforts. I also feel we have made
                        progress in getting India to offer terms better than any in recent years.
                        There is a reasonable prospect that under proper circumstances India will go
                        further still. Thus we have hoped that a resolution of the long-standing
                        dispute between you and India was in sight.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, the timing and form of Pakistan's negotiations with Peiping,
                        however justifiable these might be on other grounds, have had the
                        predictable effect of seriously clouding the atmosphere. The Government of
                        India will now find it more difficult to gain public acceptance of necessary
                        concessions to Pakistan. I know you had your reasons for concluding the
                        border agreement with Communist China. But there is no blinking how
                        adversely it has affected the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>It was with this in mind that I noted and was encouraged by your statement in
                        Dacca on the next round of talks. You said the agreement with Communist
                        China would not prejudice the Kashmir talks in Calcutta and that Pakistan
                        would enter them with honest intention to seek an equitable and honorable
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>To this end, I feel that the Pakistan delegation at Calcutta should take the
                        initiative by advancing a far more forthcoming and realistic position than
                        that adopted not only at the Karachi meetings but also subsequently heard
                        from some of your officials. I can tell you that I am also urging Mr.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> to approach the negotiations in a forthcoming
                        spirit.</p>
                    <p>Any serious effort to settle the Kashmir issue requires the willingness of
                        each side to reckon with the interests of the other in the Vale of Kashmir.
                        Yet at Karachi, neither side came to grips with this central issue. <pb
                            n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0545"/>I continue to think that the best
                        solution involves an international boundary through Kashmir. Nevertheless,
                        should you believe some other formula would be workable, I hope you will
                        come forward with it at Calcutta.</p>
                    <p>Let me again underline my conviction that there will probably never be a
                        better opportunity for an honorable settlement on terms as good as those we
                        think attainable now. If we do not succeed in our efforts this time, it
                        would seem almost inevitable that the issue would, for all practical
                        purposes, be settled on the basis of the status quo.</p>
                    <p>The Kashmir discussions are a challenge requiring patience and determination
                        along with a high order of statesmanship. I know we can count on you to do
                        your share. I hope that we can keep in close touch as the discussions
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>With warm personal regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        discouragement you expressed about Kashmir. I can see, however, how the
                        accumulated tensions and emotions of the last sixteen years make the path of
                        compromise most difficult to tread on either side.</p>

                    <p>If possible, the United States should also send planes flown by American
                        personnel wouldhave to man these fighters and communications. American
                        personnel would have to man these fighters and installations and protect
                        Indian cities from air attacks by the Chinese till Indian personnel had been
                        trained. I'm persuaded you will agree from your own experience that, in
                        negotiations such as those between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, day to day
                        developments tend to take on an importance they do not always deserve. They
                        sometimes seem to obscure the broader realities which initially caused each
                        party to conclude that agreement rather than difference was in its national
                        interest. As I think you will agree, the realities which dictate India's
                        discussions with Pakistan include the security of the subcontinent from
                        outside aggression, the need to free energies and resources for internal
                        development, and the need to end the fear of one nation and one people of
                        the subcontinent of another. These realities, and the talks resulting from
                        them, provide a historic opportunity for laying the foundations of
                        friendship, well-being and strength in South Asia. India's potential role
                        and responsibility in this historical process is central and your own
                        capacity to exercise a decisive influence is great.</p>
                    <p>In your letter you described the proposal made by India during the talks at
                        Karachi. While this was a real step forward, I suspect that until India and
                        Pakistan have made serious proposals which take into account the position of
                        each regarding the Vale, they will not have made use of the historic
                        opportunity presented by the talks. Pakistan certainly has not done so. But
                        I hope that India would nevertheless begin discussion of the Vale. It would
                        be tragic if that beginning were not made.</p>
                    <p>Let me, therefore, renew my urging that India continue to make proposals
                        which will be proof positive to the Pakistanis that you genuinely seek a
                        settlement by signalling a willingness to give Pakistan a substantial
                        position in the Vale. I urge this not only because I hope that statesmanship
                        can yet find the way to honorable compromise that is so much in the interest
                        of the subcontinent as a whole. I urge it also because India would
                        demonstrate to the world its sincerity in seeking a Kashmir settlement, and
                        would clearly show Pakistan India's desire to compromise the central issue
                        of the dispute. You will appreciate the dangers of waiting too long to take
                        this step.</p>
                    <p>As to Pakistan, I hold no brief for the timing of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s visit to Peiping nor the extent to
                        which Communist China has been enabled to use the conclusion of this
                        agreement to serve its interests. We have made this clear to them. But we
                        cannot remake the past. And with patience and tolerance there is still an
                        opportunity for the future. I hope the talks go well at Calcutta and that
                        real progress will be made.</p>

                    <p>On March 9, 1963, the Afghan Government of <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"
                            >Mohammed Daud</persName> resigned. (Telegram 394 from Kabul, March 10;

                        AFG) <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> was succeeded as Prime
                        Minister by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YDM1">Mohammed Yusuf</persName>, who
                        had served as Minister of Mines in the <persName corresp="#p_DSM1"

                            >Yusuf</persName> also held the positions of Foreign Minister and
                        Minister of Mines in the cabinet he formed on March 13. (Telegram 411 from
                        Kabul, March 13; ibid., <gloss target="#t_pol1">POL</gloss> 15-1 AFG) On
                        March 13, the Embassy in Kabul reported to the Department of State that a
                        “rash of rumor” was circulating in Afghanistan to the effect that the fall
                        of the <persName corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> government was the result
                        of “adroit U.S. engineering.” (Telegram 407 from Kabul; ibid., <gloss
                            target="#t_pol1">POL</gloss> 15 AFG)</p>
                    <p>The Department concurred with the Embassy's assessment that speculation
                        associating the United States with the change of government in Afghanistan
                        was probably inevitable and largely uncontrollable. The Department also
                        agreed that U.S. actions should provide no fuel for such speculation.
                        Accordingly, the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                        administration intended to pursue “cautious and correct” relations with the
                        new Afghan Government. The object was to “neither burden it with embraces
                        nor discourage it with coldness.” In line with that policy, the Department
                        informed the Embassy that no new initiatives with regard to the border
                        dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan were contemplated. (Telegram 248 to

                            from the Committee To Strengthen the Security of the Free World. The
                            committee was chaired by <persName>Lucius D. Clay</persName>, and the
                            report dealt with the scope and distribution of U.S. military and

                        aid is still our chief leverage, even though it may be a wasting asset, keep
                        pressing on them that a Kashmir settlement or at least an all-out Indian
                        effort to get one is central to my ability to secure them the massive aid
                        they want; and this is all too true. To add this burden on top of the
                        already staggering economic assistance we give to India may be well-nigh
                        impossible for me to sell the Congress, unless I can point to concrete
                        evidence of India's own seriousness of purpose. We'll have to move fairly
                        soon on the air umbrella and the other Indian military requirements, so we
                        don't have too much time before this leverage on the Indians will no longer
                        be as useful.</p>
                    <p>I am counting on you to get these matters moved forward. Remember that you

                                <item>The <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s are capable of
                                    reoccupying all of the areas they seized last fall. However, the
                                    Indian army has elected not to re-occupy and defend these areas.
                                    In the <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> the Indians would

                                    account of themselves in general than last fall. The Chinese
                                    logistic problem would also be much more difficult, if they
                                    tried to advance out of the Himalaya foothills into the critical
                                    river valleys. The Indians might well be able to contain any

                                    particularly if they used their air, though the Chinese might

                                    as leverage on Kashmir. Given the present limited absorptive
                                    capacity of the Indian forces, they could not really have used a

                        assume here that the Department has not lost its interest in a Kashmir
                        settlement. If this is so would hope there might be more positive indication
                        to this effect in the speed and precision of future comment.</p>
                    <p>As the basic point of departure let me note that I have exhausted my present
                        line of argument. The Indians are listening to my speeches on the <pb
                            n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0553"/>security of the subcontinent and
                        the need to placate our Congress with exceptional equanimity. I would
                        attribute this to my own incoherence were it not that the eloquent letters
                        drafted for the President are producing an equal absence of perturbation. At
                        the same time as shown by the past and forthcoming trips of the local power
                        elite to Washington, Indians have a continuing and increasing concern for
                        war production assistance, longer-run defense aid and air defense. There is
                        also (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3607 again) increasing
                        concern about developing independent strength by the <gloss target="#t_IAF1"
                            >IAF</gloss>. As the immediate fear of the Chinese Air Force recedes and
                        national pride re-asserts itself they are beginning to think of new
                        equipment. This yearning will continue and increase.</p>
                    <p>One further point. Instead of waiting for the April talks, there is a chance
                        for speeding up these dreary negotiations by getting the Indians to outline
                        an offer in advance. This would put them in a very good light, and put the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s in a position where they would have
                        to prepare a responding step. This offer should be fairly definitive and
                        could be wholly contingent on a <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        response. The Calcutta exercise (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                        3602) is causing me to have doubts about whether the existing forward
                        process is going forward at all. We need a bigger step. In light of the
                        above I propose: <list>

                                    target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and put forward a plain
                                political bargain. Alternatively, “I may ask” the above cast to do
                                it for me and preliminary soundings with TTK suggest that this could
                                be best course. The deal is that we will give the Indians
                                substantial support on machinery, equipment and raw material for the
                                development of their defense industry. We will give them backup
                                support on air. We will negotiate a sizeable program of longer-term
                                aid. These things we are prepared to work out with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName> on his forthcoming
                                trip to Washington. But we must however have something from the
                                Indians. That is a clear indication that they will make a
                                substantial concession, not a sliver, in the valley. I shall note
                                that one dominant view, which I happen to hold, is that Vale should
                                be divided with the rights to the valley residents to move and trade
                                freely across the line. There must also be ironclad guarantees to
                                the Pakistanis on the rivers. Something on this line should be
                                offered in advance of Karachi as a major move to settlement. At
                                Karachi Indians should propose a joint team of experts to work on
                                mutually acceptable arrangements in valley for presentation first to
                                ministers and then to summit.</item>

                            <item>I will stress that early indication of offer along the foregoing
                                lines will serve two purposes: (A) it will set the stage for
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName>'s
                                negotiations and enable him to sew up these vital matters, and (B)
                                it will make it possible for us to put the arm on the <gloss

                                accept. But the Indians will <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0554"

                            <item>The foregoing concerns the major step. I come now to a later stage
                                of the bargain. I plan to say that we are aware of the Indians need
                                for transport planes, high-performance fighters and pilot training.
                                The C-119's we will provide as part of the present program. However,
                                we have no choice but to go slow on high-performance fighters and
                                pilot training and probably C-130 type transport because of the
                                danger of an adverse and damaging Pakistan reaction. But it should
                                be understood that just as soon as a Kashmir settlement is effective
                                we will provide planes and training so welcome this accretion to the
                                air strength of the non-communist world. I am perfectly aware that
                                this takes us some steps beyond present thinking. Notice however
                                that it is an offer that is contingent on a settlement. Should we
                                get a settlement, some fighters and training would be a small price.
                                And it gives Indians strong incentive for further adjustments and
                                amendments beyond the major step. Once we get the major steps, small
                                changes can follow always assuming the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                    >Pak</gloss>s can be brought along.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>There are risks in the above strategy and I have no doubt that they will be
                        adequately discussed. This is the first time we have descended to quite such
                        a crude bazaar level with the Indians. They may not like it and the
                        sensitive <persName>Nehru</persName> soul may be somewhat seared. The
                        Communists and the Menonites will [garble] a barter of sacred territory for
                        the defense and sound off. However, I must stress that I have exhausted the
                        verbal lines of approach including those that are still to be suggested by
                        the Department and this is the most practical next step. Moreover, it might
                        work. Accordingly: <list>

                                (They are clear here.) I am in fact persuaded that at any time we

                                propping up his admirably unpromising career and presumably with his

                    <p>Prior to the Karachi talks we should strike a “crude bazaar level” political
                        bargain with <persName>Nehru</persName>. We would offer India defense
                        production assistance, backup support on air, and sizeable long-term aid. We
                        would ask in return that India promise to offer Pakistan in advance of the
                        Karachi talks a substantial position in the Vale and ironclad guarantees on
                        the rivers.</p>
                    <p>If India accepted, it would be up to Pakistan to respond with a suitable
                        offer. If it did not, we would go ahead with military aid to India.</p>
                    <p>We would tell the Indians now that when a Kashmir settlement is effective we
                        will provide India with high performance fighters, pilot training and
                        probably C-130's.</p>

                    <p>Our tactics assume that more common ground needs to be built up before the
                        two parties can face the final confrontation without great risk to
                        themselves and to our interests. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName>'s are designed to purchase not a settlement, but
                        an immediate breakthrough from the Indian side. The price is an open-ended
                        military commitment to India. Since this is just the thing which the
                        Pakistanis fear most, we would expect them to react violently. This would
                        reduce the likelihood of a Kashmir settlement and increase Indo-<gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> tensions. We would, therefore, suffer a
                        severe setback in our efforts to strengthen subcontinental defense against
                        Communist China. Moreover, we would risk losing the special advantages of
                        our relationship with Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>If there is no progress in the Karachi talks, we will encounter increasing
                        difficulty in getting British cooperation on additional military assistance
                        to India.</p>
                    <p>The British might reluctantly agree to commitments on air defense under the
                        scope of the joint recommendations but would find great difficulty in
                        providing defense production assistance. They have not considered long-range
                        military assistance to India; quite apart from the Kashmir issue it would
                        require a reversal of long-standing policy toward Commonwealth
                        countries.</p>

                        <p>Our objective before and during Karachi meeting is to get parties into
                            serious discussion of Vale and of line south of Vale.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that present pattern of periodic three-day ministerial
                            meetings with no provision for detailed examination of alternatives in
                            interval is productive method of negotiation. Accordingly, our objective
                            at Karachi should be sufficient ministerial agreement on political
                            elements of solution so that parties, possibly through quiet discussion
                            at technical level, could then proceed either directly to
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> meeting or to a final ministerial meeting followed
                            promptly by <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName>-<persName>Nehru</persName> meeting.</p>
                        <p>To achieve these objectives we must take vigorous action to step up badly
                            lagging tempo of talks. Practice of urging parties narrow differences by
                            offering proposals and counterproposals has not been productive.
                            Therefore, we plan stimulate proposals regarding Vale by discussing with
                            parties a number of elements which would indicate general limits of what
                            we believe practicable settlement. (Instructions <pb n="533"

                                1496. (Ibid.)</note> We would not expect either party explicitly to
                            accept these elements but we would hope that concentration on these
                            elements will assist parties, prior fifth round, to shape realistic
                            proposals to be considered at Karachi.</p>

                                    Following preliminary discussions at Rawalpindi, Delhi, and
                                    Karachi, and regrettable slow-down at Calcutta, talks have
                                    reached decisive stage. Major progress is essential and if there
                                    is to be such progress both parties must be prepared to make
                                    major compromises. We regard fifth round as key test of

                    <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by indicating the importance which he
                        attaches to the defense of the subcontinent. He emphasized the central role
                        of a Kashmir settlement in the development of that defense system.</p>

                        status of the Kashmir negotiations. The last Indian-Pakistan Ministerial
                        Meeting in Calcutta did not move the two parties forward. It may have gotten
                        them over certain hurdles growing out of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"

                        In talks here in Washington during the last few days with the British, a

                        re-emphasize to India and Pakistan the importance which the US and <gloss

                    <p>As a means of emphasizing the importance which the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> attaches to a settlement, the British are considering the
                        possibility of the Prime Minister addressing letters to Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> and President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. The United States has already moved
                        in this area by sending <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>
                        and Bob Komer for talks with senior officials in India and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The President indicated that he understood some of the reasons why, under
                        present circumstances, the Indians might be brought to a <pb n="536"
                            xml:id="pg_536" facs="0562"/>willingness to reach a compromise
                        settlement on Kashmir. He asked what incentives there were for President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> to compromise. It was
                        pointed out that the next few months might be the last good opportunity for
                        Pakistan to settle. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might be
                        able at the present time to persuade the Indians to make a substantial
                        compromise. The two countries may not have at hand equal leverage in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName>
                        was likely again to become directly involved in the negotiations. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> indicated that he did
                        not share Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s
                        feeling about the usefulness of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName>' efforts. He felt that the latter had already been of
                        substantial assistance in getting the present negotiations underway.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Indians understood that they must settle the
                        Kashmir question. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> suggested
                        that there had been some slippage in the Indian approach during the period
                        surrounding the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-<gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> border agreement but said that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s trip was designed to
                        re-emphasize to the Indians and the Pakistanis the importance of a Kashmir
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>The President asked why, if the US was going to make certain military
                        assistance available to India during the next few months, certain of the
                        arrangements could not be made promptly in a manner which could relate them
                        to a more forthcoming Indian offer on Kashmir. The Secretary and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> suggested the problem was
                        partially one of timing. It was pointed out that the India-Pakistan
                        negotiations had not yet reached the stage where it was possible for the US
                        and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to get a sufficiently clear reading of
                        what the ultimate compromise should be for us to put our full weight behind
                        a particular Indian offer. In addition, a US-Indian deal would certainly
                        leak. This would lead almost certainly to a Pakistani rejection.</p>
                    <p>The President asked how soon decisions could be made on a military aid
                        program for India. The Secretary of Defense pointed out that while the US
                        might, at an early stage, reach a decision in regard to air defense
                        questions, and perhaps on the first stage of a defense production program,
                        the Indian government's requirements for the later stages of their defense
                        production program and for their long-term military assistance program, were
                        most unclear. The US, as of now, has no firm indications from the Indians
                        for these latter requirements. It would thus be difficult at this stage to
                        relate most of these military programs to a specific Indian offer on
                        Kashmir. If such relationships were to be considered desirable, they could
                        be established much more effectively in early May.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense indicated that the costs of an air defense program
                        and of the first stage of a defense production program would not be
                        difficult to handle.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary suggested that the aim of the United States should be to secure
                        a Kashmir settlement and not just to stimulate an Indian offer <pb n="537"
                            xml:id="pg_537" facs="0563"/>which, if the Pakistanis turned it down,
                        would clear the way for additional military assistance to India. This would
                        lead to an accelerating arms race between India and Pakistan and continued
                        wastage of US and other economic resources on the subcontinent. He
                        emphasized the importance of our looking at the defense of the subcontinent
                        as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that perhaps the proper course would be to indicate
                        to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> that we might
                        come to some such proposal as his following the meeting in Karachi.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> said that he hoped that
                        enough progress could be made in narrowing the gap between the two parties
                        before and during the Karachi meeting and it would be possible after that
                        meeting for the US to be much clearer in stimulating or promoting compromise
                        proposals. In response to a question, Mr. Jackson indicated that he thought
                        it would be premature to attempt to work out a final proposal for
                        settlement, of the kind which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> suggested, previous to the Karachi meeting. He
                        felt that, using the elements of a settlement on which the US and <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had agreed (ad referendum), it should be
                        possible to get India and Pakistan at the Karachi meeting into a discussion
                        of the Vale. He believed that, following such a discussion, the US would
                        have a much more definite view of the nature of the ultimate compromise
                        toward which the parties should be encouraged to move.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> be told: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>

                            <item>That we are lacking adequate information with regard to the Indian
                                need for a long-term military aid program and that we urgently need

                                and;</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>That the kind of proposal on Kashmir which he has suggested could
                                better be considered later in April or early in May.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> asked whether this meant
                        that the President approved the scenario which had been worked out with the
                        British. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that the President might
                        wish to put the consensus that had been reached at the meeting to Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>, getting his comment,
                        before making a final decision. The Secretary suggested that the consensus
                        should similarly be sent to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName> for his comment.</p>
                    <p>The President assented to this approach.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>The message was delivered loud and clear in the two countries; and they [it]
                        may have marginally helped our Ambassadors set the stage for the
                        presentation of Principles and Round Five. In any case, as we left, the two
                        parties and the assorted doves of peace were girding themselves for what
                        they know to be a fateful period.</p>
                    <p>The reactions to our messages and the emotional and political posture of the
                        various principal actors followed a well-worn script wholly familiar to
                        those in the Kashmir business and even to observers at one remove like
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>But one reaction emerged, which I had not anticipated. It took different
                        forms with different men; it almost always surfaced as the final thought,
                        the last sentence; it was expressed at high levels and low almost
                        unconsciously, always in a moment of sincerity, by Indians and Pakistani,
                        British and Americans; with fatalism, scepticism, or anxiety; and in the
                        case of a few bitter die-hards, with anticipation.</p>
                    <p>The reaction was this: no one can yet see by what process the negotiation
                        over Kashmir—any negotiation over Kashmir—can be brought to a politically
                        viable conclusion. <persName>Nehru</persName>, after agreeing the case for a
                        settlement, asked aloud: “But how can it be done without creating more
                        tension than we now have?” <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>,
                        after warning that a Kashmir settlement might raise tensions, went through
                        his concept of moving by stages, closing in on the Vale only at the end.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Ken Galbraith</persName>'s last thought was:
                        “Perhaps the lines will never meet, but we've got to try.” The Indian High
                        Commissioner in Karachi said: “We'll discuss the Vale all right in the Fifth
                        Round; but we won't settle it; and then what do we do?”</p>
                    <p>And so it went.</p>
                    <p>This prevalent, vision of a stone wall ahead arises from a complex of
                        psychological, political, and technical negotiating problems.</p>
                    <p>First, of course, Indian minds run into a real block in surrendering any
                        substantial part of the Vale; and Pakistani minds run into an even <pb
                            n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0565"/>greater block in ceding once and
                        for all any part of the Vale to India. Quite aside from political pressures;
                        the issue is so highly charged and men's minds have run so often over the
                        tracks which rationalize their respective present positions that it is
                        literally difficult and literally painful for them to visualize a change in
                        the way things are (for Indians) or anything short of the fulfillment of
                        their dream and crusade (for Pakistani).</p>
                    <p>In addition, back in a more rational world, both sets of politicians see
                        trouble as they contemplate any conceivably negotiable Kashmir compromise;
                        and tolerably objective observers concede the possibility of trouble—for
                        example, the Pakistan High Commissioner in Delhi concedes
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s problem, and the Indian High Commissioner
                        in Karachi, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s. At the same time,
                        men perceive that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> both retain, if they are determined, very
                        large potential influence to alter the political scene. Their problem, as I
                        see it, is that they cannot afford to move off their present political
                        postures until two conditions are satisfied: the terms of the whole deal are
                        known; and each is satisfied that the other will wholeheartedly commit
                        himself before his own people to that deal. By “the whole deal” I mean the
                        terms of economic coexistence and at least implicit military collaboration
                        (as well as disengagement), not merely the Kashmir deal. The dilemma, then,
                        is this: only a radical change in political atmosphere, plus economic and
                        military ameliorations, can justify the inevitable pain of a possible
                        Kashmir settlement; but it is possible that the change in atmosphere cannot
                        be brought about until <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> see the whole package; and our present
                        negotiating sequence, for good and sufficient reasons—notably the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> desire to get at the Vale before being
                        diverted to other issues—does not permit the other, softening issues to be
                        gripped and the vested interests in both countries connected with them, to
                        be brought effectively into play.</p>
                    <p>The problem may well be complicated by the emergence of negotiating postures,
                        designed to put the other fellow in the wrong and to impress Washington and
                        world opinion rather than to move forward.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, for example, is so deeply
                        convinced of <persName>Nehru</persName>'s political unreliability (not
                        without recent reinforcing ammunition) that only very hard commitments by
                        the Indians are likely to lead him to defend reconciliation before his
                        people. Similarly, <persName>Desai</persName> asked us: “Why should we give
                        anything to the Pakistani if their hostility to us is so deeply rooted and
                        fixed that reconciliation is impossible?”; and after I heard <persName
                            corresp="#p_DSK1">Dehlavi</persName>, I was damned if I knew what I
                        could have replied to <persName>Desai</persName>. Thus, the Indians will
                        require very firm assurances that they will, in fact, get the advantages of
                        a new relation to Pakistan before surrendering any part of what they
                        hold.</p>
                    <p>It is quite clear that thoughtful men on both sides appreciate the
                        irrationality of the present arrangements and the advantages of sensible
                        coexistence; although the economic advantages are, I suspect, even <pb
                            n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0566"/>greater than most political figures
                        now understand. But the Pakistani dare not expound these nor evoke the
                        political forces that are directly interested (e.g., East Pakistan) until
                        something substantial in the Vale is sewed up; and the Indians dare not give
                        up something substantial in the Vale until it is clear that Pakistan is
                        broadly committed to a policy of conciliation and that the military benefits
                        of that policy will be available to India.</p>
                    <p>The vicious circle will operate, I suspect, even within the narrow orbit of
                        the Kashmir and Vale discussions. The complexities are inherently such that
                        “clean surgery” is either likely to lead to events which will produce the
                        higher tensions <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> fear; or it will require for its success a degree of
                        intensive and sympathetic Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        cooperation which, in turn, is only possible if the two leaders had already
                        committed themselves before their own peoples to a fundamental change in
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>I conclude, therefore, that if the principles are accepted or if the Vale
                        gets gripped in negotiation by other means, we are likely to run into a
                        dangerous cul-de-sac. At the moment the notion is, as I understand it, that
                        under such circumstances various high-level Anglo-American chaps might be
                        rushed into the breach to hold appropriate hands and try to bring the lines
                        closer together; or, in the last resort, to trot out an internationalized
                        Vale. If this analysis is correct, any amount of pressure and hand holding
                        about Kashmir will not then do the trick. Two other elements must then be
                        introduced, perhaps in sequence, before a Kashmir settlement could become
                        viable: <list>

                            <item>While the Kashmir discussion proceeds on some sustained basis, the

                                equal forum (or forums) with an understanding that a total package
                                will be brought together and no part of the negotiated deal is final
                                until all elements are brought together.</item>

                            <item>At a certain point, when the deal as a whole is clear, but before
                                it is signed and announced, <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> would have to enter into a

                                sign off, to take the case for reconciliation to their people and to
                                be prepared to deal with violent dissidents on a ruthless basis, if
                                necessary.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The latter provision may appear farfetched; but the mutual suspicions go so
                        deep and the interactions of the two governments' policies are so sensitive,
                        that until the deal is consummated—and perhaps for some time thereafter—it
                        could spiral off into a debacle unless each government performs its part of
                        the bargain with unexampled consistency and rigor.</p>
                    <p>I would only add this: assistance to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> and <persName>Nehru</persName> in finding their way
                        through this political and psychological maze will be vastly more important
                        than any direct bargaining pressure or exhortation we can mount in getting a
                        solution. Or, put another way, bargaining pressure <pb n="541"
                            xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"/>and exhortation at the right moment may
                        prove useful, but only if there is a workable track that these two highly
                        responsible politicians can perceive. Right now the central fact about
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> is that they do not see such a track, embracing the
                        full complexity of the problem—and neither does anyone else on the

                        and some abatement propaganda. On Afghan side, policy of nonincitement of
                        tribes apparently has prevailed for some time and has been given official

                            units might lead us. In particular, he noted that actual engagement of

                                target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s might lead to “war with China,”

                            against Hong Kong. He also said that an air defense commitment might
                            lead US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> close to a “defense pact” with
                            India. He suggested these implications lead back to thought that only

                    <p>On basis reports from Kabul and Karachi we judge that atmosphere on Afghan
                        side has not improved sufficiently to justify carrying forward with our
                        suggested initiative on <gloss target="#t_Af1">Af</gloss>-<gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> border impasse. We see no advantage in
                        trying this out until Afghanistan has reciprocated conciliatory <gloss

                        however, we believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJM1"
                            >Steeves</persName> should make another try at convincing new Afghan
                        leaders that favorable opportunity for improvement <gloss target="#t_Af1"
                            >Af</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations now exists but
                        will be lost unless Afghan response to conciliatory <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> gestures is forthcoming. April 1 Afghan statement is not
                        enough. There must be perceptible toning down of Pushtunistan broadcasts
                        beamed to Frontier Area. This action is sina qua non to further progress
                        particularly on question restoration Afghan consular offices in frontier
                        area. Without moderation Afghan propaganda, <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s may end their own self-imposed moratorium. While perhaps
                        desirable from <gloss target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> viewpoint to maintain
                        fiction that normal relations with Pakistan and Pushtunistan are separate
                        issues, fact remains that events August-September 1961 were direct <gloss

                        and increase in Afghan-inspired incidents in tribal area during previous
                        year. We do not wish cloud picture with Pushtunistan issue, but <gloss
                            target="#t_RGA1">RGA</gloss> should have no doubts of our view that this

                    <p>3985. I had a long (hour and a-half), difficult and by no means encouraging
                        discussion with <persName>Nehru</persName> this evening, all of it devoted
                        to Kashmir. Once or twice he got very angry, shouted and pounded the table
                        but in the end calmed down. The following emerged: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item><p>I put up to him the importance of a prompt move toward a
                                    settlement and spelled out view that this could only be
                                    accomplished by dividing the Valley with appropriate
                                    arrangements. (I avoided words “substantial position” to be sure
                                    of a fair split. This may have been a mistake.)</p>
                                <p>Thanks apparently to my careful preparatory work, he was
                                    admirably equipped with all the adverse arguments: the ancient
                                    integrity of <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0573"/>the
                                    community, the small area and (there may be some merit in this)
                                    the hostility to the idea in the Valley itself. He noted also
                                    that any retreat from the past left the Valley indefensible. I
                                    countered these arguments without much difficulty. There are
                                    innumerable places—Bengal, Assam, Punjab borders—which are
                                    equally indefensible. Partition solved the problems of Bengal
                                    and the Punjab. The effect can be softened. I was proposing this
                                    only because no better opportunity seemed in evidence. Etc.,
                                    etc.</p></item>

                            <item>He then asked why we were pressing so hard. I replied that it was
                                because we had important tasks ahead and Kashmir stood in the way of
                                completing them. He then said it would have been easier to solve the
                                issue if it hadn't become involved in the problem of arms aid and
                                related decisions. I pointed out that they were inextricably
                                involved by nature. We were serious about defense and had to pay for
                                any misuse.<note n="1" xml:id="d276fn1"><persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                                        >Galbraith</persName> elaborated upon this point in a
                                    message that he sent to <persName>Nehru</persName> on April 17.
                                    He pointed in particular to the difficulties involved in
                                    securing Congressional approval for military assistance to both
                                    parties involved in a festering dispute. (A copy of the message

                            <item>He then asked, this involving considerable anger, why we assumed
                                the Pakistanis were right and the Indians wrong. I reverted to
                                impossibility of solution that excluded either from the Valley and
                                added that Indians had in fact alienated world opinion. Their <gloss

                                and lost the wars. The American people could never understand any
                                issue that wasn't decided by a vote.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>The latter point produced a remarkable turn to the discussion. He
                                said he too would prefer a vote. I said this was most encouraging
                                news and I would promptly report it. We had avoided pressing him on
                                a plebiscite because we didn't think it was acceptable.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>I probably moved in too rapidly on this. In any case
                                    <persName>Nehru</persName> backwatered. He said such a course
                                would have to meet the approval of the Kashmir government and his
                                cabinet colleagues who were less favorable. I pointed out that the
                                people of Kashmir could hardly object to voting on their own fate
                                and his cabinet colleagues were, one assumed, subject to persuasion
                                on his part. He then elaborately emphasized the personal nature of
                                his remark and said he would have to consult with his
                                colleagues.</item>
                            <label>(6)</label>
                            <item>There was a great deal more debate which would be far too dreary
                                to repeat. I returned repeatedly to the question of whether he
                                wanted me to report to Washington that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> although avowing a desire for settlement had
                                nothing to offer. He kept reiterating that they had offered a great
                                deal and I in turn pointed out ad nauseum that they had not offered
                                anything in the Valley and no Pakistan government could accept any
                                solution that excluded them from the Valley. He also went off <pb

                                China and other irrelevantia. I noted that our intelligence on
                                Kurshid's movements was quite good and dismissed this and the
                                allegation that the Chinese were training guerrillas in Kashmir as
                                fabrications.</item>

                            <item><p>I kept pressing him if he rejected partition as to what he had
                                    to offer of an affirmative sort. While I could understand his
                                    reluctance on some solutions I could not accept his reluctance
                                    on all. There was, perhaps, a half hour of this. The upshot was
                                    a postponement. He finally said he wanted to consult his cabinet
                                    colleagues before making a final statement as to what they could
                                    accept. We made an engagement to meet the end of the week.</p>
                                <p>I am naturally disappointed. He was in a very resistant mood and
                                    I had the feeling that something may have bitten him in the last
                                    day or two.</p></item>

                        perpetuating rift between Pakistan and Afghanistan and would show their
                        cleverness in stirring up Afghan distrust of Pakistan. When I took issue
                        with this estimate, he argued that India saw merit in dividing her neighbors
                        in South Asia and particularly in preserving an example of <gloss

                        Muslim country. He thought Education Minister and others who would accompany
                        President were carefully selected for their presumed ability to influence
                        the Afghans.</p>

                            Strategically, we would still need to be in a position to give India
                            some assistance against Chinese Communist pressure, tailoring this as
                            best we possibly can to maintain our security interests in
                            Pakistan.</item>

                        <item>If there is no major progress on Kashmir at the fifth round, we
                            anticipate that the British will be strongly resistant to further
                            military assistance to India this summer. Even if there should be
                            substantial progress, there are as yet few if any indications that the
                            British would be prepared to move further with the U.S. on the Nassau
                            50-50 formula or anything approaching that. Reinforcing the desire of
                            some elements of the British Government to be more forthcoming, however,
                            are pressures related to the need to provide production contracts for
                            distressed areas and the desire to avert U.S. pre-emption of traditional
                            British relations with India.</item>

                        has not been declassified by the Indian Government. In his biography of

                        letter, which was an Indian response to U.S. efforts to mediate in the
                        Kashmir dispute, and quoted a sentence from the letter which summed up
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s reaction to those efforts: “Intervention by
                        third powers, if quiet, inobtrusive and objective, might have been helpful;
                        but public and semi-public efforts at pressure had only worsened the
                        situation. ‘I am convinced that these ill-considered and ill-conceived
                        initiatives, however well-intentioned they may be, have at least for the
                        present made it impossible to reach any settlement on this rather involved

                        less weight on <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s hard sell
                        or introduction of US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> “elements” than on
                        the likelihood that these and other steps simply made
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> at long last face up to what we wanted on
                        Kashmir. <persName>Nehru</persName> tends to avoid facing up to unpleasant
                        decisions as long as possible, and we know that he personally is the chief
                        roadblock to a forthcoming Indian position on Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>Thus Ken's pressure and the “elements” seem more precipitant than cause of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s reaction. Nonetheless we may have pushed
                        him harder and more precisely than was wise, particularly Ken. As he told me
                        when there and indicated in private messages, he was already airing to TTK

                        the “elements” of a settlement (approved by you on 1 April), Ken was already
                        so far down his own track that he apparently decided to go ahead. He felt
                        (1) the only way to pin the elusive <persName>Nehru</persName> down was with
                        a concrete proposition; (2) to switch back to the “elements” alone was bad;
                        and (3) his proposal was fully consistent with the “elements.” In effect,
                        Ken was disgusted with what he regarded as US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> shilly-shallying, and anxious to settle the affair before he
                        left Delhi. His cables show he was quite aware of the risk that he'd
                        precipitate a <persName>Nehru</persName> turndown. Of course, fear of just
                        such an impasse was precisely why State proposed stepping up US/<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> intervention by means of a vague set of
                        principles (which could apply to partition or internationalization) rather
                        than going Ken's route. The expected occurred; in two rough sessions with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> on 15 and 20 April Ken got nowhere, and
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s visible irritation was ample omen of the
                        fireworks to come.</p>
                    <p>Just at this point <persName>Nehru</persName> got the “elements” paper,
                        regrettably first given in writing to the Indians via our Embassy in
                        Karachi. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s complaint about them goes less to
                        their substance than to his fear they were a product of US-<gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> collusion. There is little doubt that
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>'s delay in giving them
                        to the Indians was a tactical error. We told them to the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0580"
                        />on April 11th, and then <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>
                        (assuming Ken had also told them to Indians) gave a copy to the Indian
                            <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> in Karachi on the 18th at the
                        latter's request. <hi rend="italic"><persName>Nehru</persName> and others
                            must have immediately jumped to the conclusion we had cleared them with
                            the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s first</hi>, so over-read them
                        as meaning more concessions and reacted emotionally. Up to this point they
                        probably felt we were genuinely trying to tone down <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> claims; now they felt we were again peddling <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> wares. True, Ken and then <persName
                            corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Gore-Booth</persName> had mentioned the “elements”
                        to Gundevia, <persName>Desai</persName>, and even
                        <persName>Nehru</persName>, but in such low key it apparently didn't
                        register. In fact, <persName>Nehru</persName> asked Ken on the 20th why he
                        hadn't brought the “elements” into the discussion sooner, and Ken replied
                        that he was more interested in hard specifics.</p>
                    <p>It is in the above light that one must read <persName>Nehru</persName>'s
                        complaint that he'd understood from <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> the US felt only the “northwest corner” of the
                        Vale (down to Wular Lake) need be given to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s. This was indeed our original idea, and Ken admits he told
                        Indians (Delhi 4101).<note n="4" xml:id="d280fn4">Telegram 4101, April 22,

                                corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> concluded that the Indian
                            Government saw in the “elements” paper a welcome opportunity to “get off
                            the hook on specific and concrete concessions in the valley.”
                            (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_pol1">POL</gloss>
                            32-1 INDIA-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">PAK</gloss>)</note> Then we decided
                        to up the ante somewhat by moving our proposed line down toward Srinagar,
                        but the Indians presumably didn't know this and Ken claims he'd already
                        switched to talking about a line “somewhere between Wular Lake and
                        Srinagar.” Nonetheless the Indians must have learned about this change, and
                        regarded it as upping the ante on them. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s letter
                        amply indicates that he interpreted the “elements” as being just this.</p>
                    <p>The moral of this story is that one can't effectively stage-manage a
                        difficult negotiation when the two parties are getting different signals
                        from us, and when each is prone to assume the worst. Ken's decision to
                        handle things his own way was done with his eyes open. He took a chance in
                        order to move the ball forward, and it backfired.</p>
                    <p>But as Ken himself agrees, at some point we would probably have hit this
                        stone wall anyway. <persName>Nehru</persName> in fact turned Ken down twice
                        on partition (on the 15th and 20th) before seizing on the “elements” to
                        cover his intransigence. The reasons for this basic attitude are many, e.g.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> is a Kashmiri himself, his concern lest he
                        appear to be yielding to US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> pressure, his
                        emotional reaction to the badly chosen <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        pressure tactics, less sense of urgency over the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss> threat.</p>
                    <p>We should shift tactics now and see if he'll buy something other than
                        partition. But the odds are that between <persName>Nehru</persName>'s
                        emotional reluctance and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                        insistence on more than half a loaf we aren't going to get a Kashmir
                        settlement. Hence the issue may soon become one of whether, and how far, we
                        go ahead regardless on aid to India.</p>

                        arms aid to India. <persName>Ahmed</persName> stated <gloss target="#t_GOP1"

                        long-range military assistance to India in absence Kashmir solution. He then
                        reviewed at length familiar arguments: Indians will reach accommodation with
                        Chinese Communists; <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s have no
                        intention resuming attack; already precarious military balance on
                        subcontinent will be greatly upset by doubling of India's arms budget taken
                        together with outside aid; in view past history Indian actions in Hyderabad,
                        Kashmir, Junagadh and Goa, <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> does not
                        trust Indian intentions; India will use its superior military strength
                        against neighbors, etc. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> believes US has
                        great leverage now with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and should use
                        it get settlement Kashmir. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> concludes
                        it will receive arms without Kashmir solution, then there will be no chance
                        for solution.</p>
                    <p>Secretary stated we cognizant <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> concerns
                        and fears and he was looking forward to full discussion all aspects problems
                        with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in Karachi. Said that we had not yet
                        taken decisions on long-range arms aid to India but reports of various study
                        groups were being examined and we were discussing matter with <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Perforce we viewed arms aid to India from
                        somewhat different perspective than <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>.
                        Secretary indicated our impression was that initial arms aid may have had
                        something to do with <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> cease-fire
                        and that any future arms aid might act as deterrent to possible future
                        Chinese aggression directed at subcontinent. Defense of subcontinent is of
                        concern to all of us. In our own national interests we must get a clear
                        signal to the Chinese about the consequences of further aggression. Pakistan
                        could hardly be comfortable if another attack occurred. Defense of
                        subcontinent, as well as whole Free World, is indivisible. Those issues
                        which divide countries in non-Communist world must be solved in order
                        present unified front to Communist pressure.</p>
                    <p>Next few months may be somber for all of us. Soviet domestic troubles, its
                        relations with Peiping, failures in Iraq, Congo, and elsewhere <pb n="556"
                            xml:id="pg_556" facs="0582"/>are causing Soviets reappraise their
                        policies. Possible outcome may be some retreat from policy coexistence to
                        resumption more bellicose policy closer to stance of <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. US trying probe in many ways Soviet
                        intentions but we must be alert possibility we face dangerous period ahead
                        during which <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s may push out against
                        points on Free World perimeter. We must, therefore, view arms aid to India
                        and defense subcontinent in context this possible threat. US cannot subject
                        our over-all strategic objectives to settlement Kashmir, or any other single
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>US, however, as <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s well know, is anxious
                        for Kashmir settlement. Otherwise we would not be in present onerous
                        position in middle between <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Kashmir dispute has cost us dearly. US has
                        no brief for any particular settlement. Any settlement both sides can agree
                        upon is satisfactory to us if it contributes to stability subcontinent and
                        improved Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ahmed</persName> stated <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        interpreted US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> “principles” as in effect
                        advocating partition of Vale and <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> could
                        never agree partition. Secretary said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                        apparently equally adamantly opposed to partition. At least two parties had
                        agreed on what they could not accept and perhaps this would pave way for
                        consideration other solutions.</p>
                    <p>In closing, <persName>Ahmed</persName> commented that US and <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> are in full agreement on gravity of world
                        situation and objectives. Differences arose in tactics. In <gloss

                        easing of tensions in subcontinent, will not result in more secure
                        subcontinent.</p>

                    <p>In preparation for my visits to Karachi and New Delhi, we should discuss
                        several issues which we face in India and Pakistan. It would be <pb n="557"
                            xml:id="pg_557" facs="0583"/>premature, however, to seek final decisions
                        on these matters at present. The following represents the views of the
                        Department of State:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1. Kashmir</hi></p>
                    <p>Our pressure on Kashmir has angered Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>; his
                        misunderstanding, for whatever reasons, of our tactics has caused him to
                        think we have been doubledealing. Responsibility for this appears to rest
                        partly on his own officials. The resulting fireworks have clearly revealed
                        the Indian position. In being willing to discuss a political settlement with
                        Pakistan, the Indians have not been willing to go beyond minor border
                        adjustments except apparently to the extent of an offer of the northwestern
                        third of the Vale to Pakistan. They had believed this would satisfy us even
                        if it didn't satisfy the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Nehru</persName>'s letter to you<note n="1" xml:id="d282fn1"
                                ><ref target="#d279">Document 279</ref>.</note> clearly indicates a
                        hardened position on Kashmir, loss of confidence in our “objectivity” on the
                        issues, and unwillingness to have his need for military aid be used to force
                        him to make large enough concessions on Kashmir to satisfy Pakistan's
                        requirements for a settlement. The combination of the Chinese withdrawal,
                        the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> exploitation of the Indian
                        difficulties with the Chinese, and our own strategic interests in the
                        subcontinent do in fact limit our leverage with the Indians on the Kashmir
                        issue. At this juncture <persName>Nehru</persName> is the principal key to
                        the achievement of any movement on Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        issues. Therefore, the task is to see what can be done to get
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> back in tune with us, and to reaffirm the
                        considerations which lead us to view a settlement of the Kashmir issue as so
                        important to the security of the subcontinent. The Pakistanis must be led to
                        understand that <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> aggressiveness
                        against India also constitutes a threat to Pakistan. Once they do, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> may be more willing to continue talks
                        with the Indians and to explore the necessary compromises to achieve
                            Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> accord.</p>
                    <p>This requires that we now explore in Karachi and New Delhi possible
                        directions in which the talks might proceed in the future.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d282fn2">The fifth round of talks concerning Kashmir took place
                            in Karachi April 22-25. According to a summary of the talks sent to

                            and <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Singh</persName> agreed was that the
                            valley of Kashmir could not be partitioned. The two delegations agreed
                            to continue the talks in New Delhi on May 15, but the Pakistanis spoke
                            of the sixth round as a “last go” at the Kashmir issue. (<gloss

                        relations. It is clear that we cannot expect the timetable for the talks to
                        fit our schedule for making decision on aid to India, even though there will
                        continue to be a correlation between the two problems. At least for a
                        cooling off period, our pressure should be greatly eased.</p>

                    <p>The Commonwealth-U.S. Air Defense Mission found that a measure of security
                        from strategic air attack can be provided to the Calcutta and New Delhi
                        areas by 2-3 Western fighter squadrons using U.S.-U.K. mobile radars. Such
                        air defense assistance would strengthen the deterrent to a <gloss

                        continuing Western interest in India's defense at little expense, strengthen
                        India at minimum cost to our relations with Pakistan, and buy us time during
                        which we could hold off on other military aid if we desired. There is, of
                        course, some question whether this degree of involvement in India's defense
                        would stimulate a Chinese military reaction against the West in the event of
                        actual hostilities between the Chinese and Western aircraft.</p>
                    <p>The British, however, are uncertain whether they should go ahead on this.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> is worried about the
                        consequences of an engagement between these Western squadrons and the
                        Chinese Air Force. In any case, he believes our defense assistance should be
                        conditioned on a Kashmir settlement. We believe we should make every effort
                        to get the British to provide this assistance jointly with us; perhaps you
                        should write to <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Note: In connection with air defense as well as with defense production and
                        long-range military assistance discussed below, I believe there are two very
                        important questions which we may have to face but which ought not to be
                        answered until after my talks in Karachi and New Delhi. These questions are:
                        (1) whether we should provide substantial military assistance to India
                        without U.K./Commonwealth participation and (2) whether we should provide
                        such substantial assistance regardless of the state of Indo-<gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Defense Production</hi></p>
                    <p>Our Defense Production Team, the Staley group, has mapped out a program,
                        keyed initially to a four-year program to meet the combat needs of the
                        Nassau 6 mountain divisions, which would require foreign exchange support up
                        to a total of $34 million for capital goods and $20 million per year for raw
                        materials. Such assistance would have the advantage of helping to meet
                        India's defense needs, and contributing to the development of its economy.
                        The principal problem it gives us is its possible effect on our relations
                        with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The British, for many reasons, give defense production assistance a very low
                        priority. These reasons include their concern about their relations with
                        Pakistan, their limited aid resources, and their concern about the possible
                        effect on British industry. They believe it should be conditioned on Kashmir

                    <p>We are inclined to believe that we should approve the Staley plan for defense
                        production support of the six mountain divisions and do our best to get the
                        British to share costs. The question of timing of notification of the
                        Indians is a separate matter on which we would reach a decision after my
                        visit to Karachi. As a minimum we should go ahead on a piecemeal basis with
                        certain projects (e.g., U.S. surplus ordnance equipment) during the next
                        several months.</p>

                    <p>Although we have done some preliminary planning, our plans on this have not
                        yet taken concrete shape. The Department of State is satisfied, however,
                        that there should be military assistance to India beyond the present phase.
                        The questions relate to extent, types, and timing of military
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>There are very good political and military justifications for long-range
                        assistance regardless of the outcome of the Kashmir talks. We have much at
                        stake in India and the Chinese can be expected to threaten the Free World at
                        the periphery of their control for many years. Not only must we maintain a
                        degree of Indian military strength to deal with the chance that fighting may
                        again flare up on the border, but we must also support our efforts to
                        strengthen our political relationship with India in a concrete manner.
                        Additionally, we must give India confidence that it has our support in the
                        growing confrontation with Communist China.</p>

                        (Consortium)</hi></p>
                    <p>Very preliminary indications are that Western contributions this year in
                        support of India's Third Plan may fall short of India's estimate of its
                        requirements. If this is combined with a failure to meet Indian requests in
                        the military field, we can expect an adverse Indian reaction.</p>
                    <p>A preliminary meeting of the Indian Consortium will be held on April 30-May 1
                        to consider the progress of economic development in India and India's aid
                        requirements for the third year (April 1963 to March 1964) of the Third
                        Five-Year Plan. This meeting will be followed by a pledging session several
                        weeks later, probably in Paris.</p>
                    <p>The Indians have indicated a requirement for the Plan's third year of $1,255
                        million. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is requesting $450 million in
                        development loan funds for India for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964.
                        If this becomes available, and if the Export-Import Bank approves another
                        $50 million, the U.S. will be able to provide up to $500 million for the
                        third year of India's Third Five-Year Plan.</p>
                    <p>How much aid the U.S. would provide will depend primarily upon contributions
                        from other members of the Consortium. We estimate that <gloss

                        will pledge an aggregate of $200 million. It now appears that the
                        contributions of other countries may be as low as $200-$300 million. If we
                        followed last year's precedent we would merely match the <pb n="560"
                            xml:id="pg_560" facs="0586"/>contributions of these other countries.
                        This would limit India's total foreign aid to somewhere between $600 and
                        $800 million. Once we have a better idea of what these other countries will
                        do, we will have to decide whether to abandon our matching technique in
                        order to enable India to come closer to meeting its over-all requirements of
                        $1,255 million.</p>

                    <p>There is a substantial gap between Pakistan's wishes for economic aid and
                        what the Consortium thinks Pakistan needs. This is of particular concern to
                        us because of the delicate state of our current relations with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>At the Pakistan “pre-Consortium” meeting in Paris on March 28-29, a consensus
                        was reached among the donors that the level of aid required for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 to meet Pakistan's Plan targets is in
                        the range of $350 to $400 million of new money. The U.S. strongly supported
                        the figure of $400 million indicating that it would be prepared to pledge up
                        to about $200 million of the total. Last year the U.S. contributed $250
                        million, constituting 53% of the total Consortium aid including <gloss

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>, which had asked for $550 million,
                        reacted strongly to the results of the pre-Consortium meeting. Top officials
                        blamed the U.S. for the rejection of their $550 million request. They also
                        insist that the U.S. not reduce its contribution below that of last
                        year.</p>
                    <p>There is to be a pledging session of the Consortium in Washington on May 2-3.
                        On the basis of information now available, we are by no means sure that the
                        contributions from all other members will come to $200 million.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to inform the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that while
                        we support the $400 million figure, we stand ready to examine with Pakistan
                        and other Consortium members possible additional needs for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 should events indicate that the

                    <p>A problem which is not yet ready for decision is Bokaro, the proposed public

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> described his pending
                        mission to India and Pakistan. Our overriding purpose is some accommodation
                        between Pakistan and India. The question is how to achieve it. If we back
                        India against the Chinese, we may drive the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s off the deep end; if we abandon the Indians, they might
                        move toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China again. On
                        the merits of Kashmir, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> felt the
                        shape of the settlement was irrelevant to us. We could buy anything they
                        could agree on. The trouble was that any settlement would be more favorable
                        to Pakistan than the status quo; it was precisely [that] which created the
                        problem with India. He saw two other issues: (1) should we get involved in
                        aiding India without the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if necessary—we
                        felt we must do so if India were really threatened, but must make every
                        effort to bring the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> along; (2) should we
                        give India substantial military aid regardless of Indo-Pakistan relations.
                        We shouldn't condition aid totally on a <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                        >Pak</gloss>/Indian reconciliation, nor should we go ahead ignoring it. We
                        should condition aid partly on the course of Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then outlined the
                        military aid problem. It was essentially a small one; as the intelligence
                        community pointed out, the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat
                        was small over the next 2-3 years. Their maximum capability in Tibet/Ladakh
                        amounted to 230,000 men, of whom only 120,000 could be combat forces. They
                        would need 40,000 trucks and 40% of the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss> 1962 gasoline supply to support such a force. To cope
                        with this threat, we and the British estimate that 12-14 Indian divisions
                        are needed or with reserves some 16 divisions and 3 brigades, totalling an
                        army of 650,000. But the Indians want to build up to 1.4 million men, a $1.8
                        million <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0588"/>annual defense budget of
                        their own, and $1.6 billion in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> over the
                        next three years. All this is quite unrealistic.</p>
                    <p>The air threat is even smaller than the ground threat; <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> himself really didn't think there
                        is any. The Indians could meet this air threat by themselves if they were
                        not so inefficient.</p>
                    <p>So the first problem from a military viewpoint was to develop a realistic
                        program. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> personally
                        estimated this at a maximum around $300 million jointly from the US and
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> over the next three years (including
                        defense production), and perhaps only half that. It would take 2-3 months to
                        work up such a realistic program. However, there was also a serious
                        political problem involved in the Indian military buildup as it bore on
                        Kashmir. The President queried whether $300 million would be enough for the
                        purpose and <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> asked
                        whether the estimated threat included that from Burma; it was essential to
                        look at the problem of defense of the entire subcontinent. Including Burma
                        was essential if one looked at the problem in the framework of a decade.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed but felt this
                        didn't bear on the immediate Indian buildup problem. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> pointed out that our estimate of the
                        threat is based on existing <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>
                        logistic facilities and does not include what the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss>s could do over the next three years or so. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said one couldn't add Burma to
                            <gloss target="#t_NEFA1">NEFA</gloss> as an additional route of invasion
                        because we estimated the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s couldn't
                        support both. Moreover, Burma would present the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss>s with a vastly more complicated political problem if
                        they chose to use this route.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> regarded the Indian
                        buildup problem as 70% political. We had hoped for ten years that India
                        would see the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat as we saw it.
                        Now the Indians did; indeed they were the only major Asian power which took
                        such a realistic view. Japan did not, for example. Indian help is essential
                        for a non-nuclear balance of power in Asia vis-a-vis the <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. Nor should we make the mistake of
                        assuming that the Indians don't have other options; they are perfectly
                        capable of patching up their differences with China and of getting more
                        Soviet help as an alternative to their current desire for US/<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> support. Could we let this happen? We should
                        give the Indians an “emotional assurance” as soon as possible that we are
                        with them; this would buy us a little time. Third, we should think of aiming
                        Indian manpower toward SEA, not just of Indian defense against the threat
                        from the north. This would also ease our problem with Pakistan, because the
                        SEA threat would tend to unite the Indians and <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>The President again asked whether we could get the Indians to take the same
                        view of the Chinese threat we do with only $300 million in US/<gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> support. As we saw it, we couldn't get the
                        Indians to “come down from $1.6 billion to $300 million.” How could we avoid
                        a real clash and disillusionment? <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> thought that we could; however, we <pb n="563"
                            xml:id="pg_563" facs="0589"/>could go to 800,000 men and could probably
                        agree on a $300 million and 800,000 men program in 2-3 months. The President
                        said he was inclined to agree with <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> that we should go ahead with the Indian program
                        shortly. We had never been able to get the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        to go 50-50 on anything else, so while trying to bring them along, we should
                        not limit ourselves to their pace. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> both
                        pointed out the Congressional problem, if we tried to go much above $300
                        million and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> didn't participate.</p>
                    <p>The President said he couldn't see how we could stop Communist China without
                        India. “Let's not be penny wise about India; let's not let them get into a
                        position where they feel that they can't cope with the <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s on top of their other problems.” Our policy should be not
                        to let the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> restrain us from going ahead.
                        He agreed we should do our best to bring the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> along, but “India is the important thing; not the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.” We shouldn't settle finally on $300 million
                        just because this is the most we could get on a 50-50 basis. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> argued we should separate the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> issue from that of realistic planning.
                        He thought the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wouldn't even go along with
                        half of $300 million. It was generally agreed this was so.</p>
                    <p>The discussion turned to the air defense commitment. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt this had great political
                        value; <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed it was very
                        important. The President said that if the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss>s bombed India we would of course become involved, so he
                        didn't see too much risk in giving a prior commitment. He asked when we
                        should give the Indians our decisions on aid. <persName corresp="#p_GJP1"
                            >Grant</persName> argued that we need to convince the Indians we are
                        really going to help them. An air defense commitment shortly would buy us
                        time to hammer out a realistic <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> contended that shooting at
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> planes in India would lead
                        almost certainly to the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s shooting
                        at us elsewhere. It would immediately broaden the war. At the President's
                        request, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW1"
                            >Komer</persName> described the proposed air defense package. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated that the only cost
                        would be some $15 million for radar, nothing else. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested we not commit ourselves on
                        air defense until he and <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>
                        returned.</p>
                    <p>The President agreed, but said let's consider air defense shortly. We want
                        the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s to know what we are going to
                        do so they won't attack. We were sending planes to Saudi Arabia so why
                        shouldn't we go ahead with India? He felt that we should engage in intensive
                        talks with the Indians and attempt to bring them down to realistic levels.
                        But we should keep these talks on the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                        level without State Department participation so we didn't appear to tie the
                        talks too much to political conditions such as Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>As to a Kashmir settlement, the President thought the chances were almost
                        nil. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed unless the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could manage to move the Indians. Maybe
                        Mountbatten could when he was out in India. The President <pb n="564"
                            xml:id="pg_564" facs="0590"/>asked what we should do about <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. He felt we must make clear to
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> we were doing our best on
                        Kashmir but couldn't hold off indefinitely on aid to India. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed and said we must tell the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s we couldn't subordinate our larger
                        interests to their quarrel with India over Kashmir.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> give a careful oral rebuttal in Delhi to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s accusations about the “elements,” in lieu
                        of the President's replying to Nehru's letter now (especially since
                            <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had already given a
                        written reply). The President thought we should tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> we've got to go ahead with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, while telling <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        that military aid to him without a Kashmir settlement will cause us all
                        sorts of trouble with the Paks and our own Congress. He asked whether we
                        were likely to get thrown out of our base in Pakistan if we went ahead with
                        aid to India? <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought it would be
                        rough; we might lose our Pakistani base unless the <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s attacked again.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the consortium problem with Pakistan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GWS1">Gaud</persName> explained the situation. The <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s want from us at least last year's level of
                        $250 million, and a total of $550 million from the consortium as a whole. We
                        just didn't think they needed this much.</p>
                    <p>The President returned to the air defense problem, saying <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> and others on the staff felt we
                        should go ahead with air defense soon. However, we would wait for <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s judgment. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> urged that we go ahead on some gesture of this sort.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested staff talks with
                        the Indians at a military level about sending the US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> air defense squadrons as a means of indicating to the
                        Indians our continued interest in helping them.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> returned to the problem of
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> participation. We certainly ought to
                        have the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in. To get Congressional support
                        of our Indian program, one of three conditions would have to be met: (1) a
                        Kashmir settlement; or (2) a realistic program; or (3) the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> going along. He had discovered on the Hill
                        that Congressional opposition to Indian aid was strong. We had also found
                        the British most reluctant to go along with further aid to India at this
                        point. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that as always
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had the vulnerability of Hong Kong
                        very much in mind.</p>
                    <p>The President thought we ought to go ahead on air defense and work on
                        Congress to this end. Congress would be much madder if India went Communist.
                        Air defense was the least expensive move we could make and the least
                        offensive to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. If the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wouldn't go along, we should go ahead
                        ourselves. We could put the program under the guise of training. He wondered
                        why we couldn't fly squadrons into India for exercises? <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated this was part of the
                        proposal. It was agreed that if the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s
                        wanted similar exercises there wouldn't be much problem, since we already
                        had <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> exercises with the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if it made sense for us
                        to have a carrier in the Indian Ocean on a regular basis? <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Anderson indicated that
                        carrier <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0591"/>visits would be no problem
                        but that it would over-extend us if we tried to maintain a carrier there on
                        a regular basis. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had a small carrier
                        in the area.</p>

                    <p>The Government of the United States proposes to the British Government the
                        initiation of discussions by appropriate military and civil representatives
                        of the two Governments looking toward the possible strategic use of certain
                        small islands in the Indian Ocean area.<note n="1" xml:id="d284fn1"
                            >According to an April 25 memorandum from Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                            State for Politico-Military Affairs <persName>Jeffrey C.
                                Kitchen</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis
                                Johnson</persName>, this note grew out of a recommendation by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff that the Department of State initiate discussion
                            with the British on the possible long-term development of base
                            facilities in the Indian Ocean area. The Joint Chiefs cited a need for
                            such bases for possible contingency operations. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>The two Governments share a common concern for an adequate long-term allied
                        presence in the area, and it is thus considered important that there be
                        effective coordination of strategic planning on the matter. To this end the
                        United States Government would like to explore with the British Government
                        the military and technical considerations involved in any such joint effort.
                        It is further suggested that if the appropriate authorities conclude that
                        mutually advantageous planning is feasible, the two Governments might then
                        proceed at a higher level to discuss the political aspects of the
                        availability of locations in the area to support military plans.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Government of the United States proposes that the inital
                        discussions be undertaken between appropriate military authorities of the
                        two Governments either in London or in Washington and, as necessary, in the
                        area under consideration.</p>

                        <item>In general, we should prepare to go ahead on military support for
                            India. Given the declining prospects for a Kashmir settlement, we should
                            not hold off so long on aid, in order to get leverage on Kashmir, that
                            we jeopardize the developing relationship between the US and India. It
                            is hard to see how we can stop the Chinese Communists without
                            India.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>As to the magnitude of further military aid, we should try to get the
                            Indians down to a realistic program, but should regard $300 million
                            (including defense production aid) over three years from the US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> as a floor rather than a ceiling.
                            It will be difficult to bridge the political gap between India's
                            exaggerated hopes for $1.6 billion in aid over this period and our
                            preliminary judgment that no more than $300 million is militarily
                            realistic.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>While we should make every effort to bring the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> along on further aid, we should not limit ourselves to
                            their preferred pace. It is unrealistic to expect that the British will
                            go fifty-fifty even on a $300 million program. Therefore, our policy
                            should be not to let the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> restrain us
                            from moving to the extent we think desirable.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We and the British should engage in intensive talks with the Indians
                            at the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and military level to bring
                            more realism into their thinking and to counter any impression that we
                            are stalling on aid. The State Department should avoid participating in
                            these talks so they won't appear to be tied to political conditions,
                            i.e. Kashmir.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>We ought to go ahead shortly on the air defense commitment, but will
                            reserve final judgment until Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName>'s return from the subcontinent. This commitment
                            seems the least expensive way to reassure India of our continued
                            interest in its defense, while being the move least offensive to the
                            Pakistani. We should try hard to get the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> to join us, but be prepared to do most of the job

                        <item>The atmosphere was entirely relaxed and friendly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> sent warm personal message to the
                            President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> and
                            took repeated opportunities to express appreciation for US assistance
                            and for friendship between our two countries. He also expressed
                            understanding of the heavy burdens carried by the US in the total world
                            situation and said that he understood that we would have to make our own
                            decisions in the light of such responsibilities. At no time did he make
                            threats or express any bitterness insofar as US-Pakistan relations were
                            concerned. Indeed, he told us he had rebuked the editor of “Dawn” for
                            his inflammatory and unrepresentative attitude.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It is clear that he has written off any further Kashmir negotiations
                            and expects to rest on the status quo rather than accept deep
                            compromises on Pakistan position. This came out in response to my
                            probing as to how he saw the course of events if negotiations completely
                            broke down. His reference to status quo rather than to some wild
                            initiative may be of some significance. He did say that Pakistan public
                            opinion would blame the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the
                            Government of Pakistan and would say that <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568"
                                facs="0594"/>the government had played the fool in being drawn into
                            the negotiations in the first place.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Entire conversation was marked by his deep fear, distrust, and hatred
                            of India and especially the Brahmin <persName>Nehru</persName> whom he
                            regards as an evil and dangerous man. He said that this was the first
                            time in Indian history that this particular kind of Indian had exercised
                            power; former Indian rulers were like the chivalrous Rajputs with a high
                            sense of honor and responsibility. He is utterly convinced that India
                            not only wishes to eliminate Pakistan but to absorb other neighboring
                            states such as Nepal, Burma, and Ceylon. I told him that we ourselves
                            did not share this view of Indian objectives and asked him, if this were
                            not an Indian policy, what the Indians could do or say to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. He replied that there
                            is nothing India could do, that Pakistan knows them too well.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>He analyzed his view of the nature of the Chinese military threat to
                            the subcontinent and said that the Chinese could not support more than
                            seven brigades directed against India across the Himalayas. He added
                            that the Chinese had told them that this was their own estimate both
                            with respect to what India could push at China across the mountains and
                            what China could do in reverse. I gave him a brief statement of our own
                            estimates which were somewhat higher.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>He spent some time on further arms aid to India though none on
                            recrimination for aid already given. He looks upon this as strengthening
                            India against its smaller neighbors and that <persName>Nehru</persName>
                            is using the Chinese threat as a cloak to build up for other purposes.
                            Thus he argues that the effect of arms aid to India would be to weaken
                            the situation in the general area because of the stresses and strains it
                            would produce. He said that he was almost alone in Pakistan in holding
                            back the flood of public feeling on this subject. I outlined world-wide
                            responsibilities within which our own decision would have to be made but
                            this will be covered in full report.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>I did raise “in the most tentative fashion” what his attitude would be
                            if the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were to establish
                            certain air squadrons to offer some defense to Indian cities against
                            Chinese attack and as an alternative to a comparable build-up of the
                            Indian Air Force. He immediately endorsed this idea saying, among other
                            things, that it would help make the Indians behave.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Further, he did say if the Chinese again attacked India that we should
                            provide additional emergency assistance and saw this as a full
                            substitute for any military assistance prior to such an attack. He was
                            not impressed with the deterrent role of strengthened Indian forces
                            since he obviously looks upon Indian strength as aimed primarily at
                            himself.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>He raised his desire to buy some 70 German F86F's which they are
                            willing to sell for $7 million including a substantial number of spare
                            parts, portion of which interchangeable with F86F's. Having consulted
                                <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0595"/><persName>Bundy</persName>,
                            I told him that we would raise no policy objection but that I urged him
                            as a military man to look at these with a glassy stare in order to be
                            completely sure that he was getting something he wanted other than
                            “white elephant.” I mentioned operational and maintenance problems in
                            his country as compared to highly specialized circumstances central
                            European front. My guess is that he will go ahead with this purchase,
                            but he is in no position whatever to chide us if this proves to be a
                            disappointment. He insisted that he was not intending to augment his air
                            force, except that he wanted some night fighter capability.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Regarding Afghanistan, he seems to be in a mood to try to find some
                            agreement on a 50-50 or even “40-60” basis, but remained skeptical about
                            attitude of new government because he does not believe it possible that
                            it could have taken office without full approval of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSM1">Daud</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                                >Naim</persName>. I believe we should ourselves proceed on the
                            optimistic assumption that Iranian initiative can work, but should
                            recognize that we may be a long way from settlement.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>He also made an earnest appeal on Tarbela and gave me some papers to
                            read on which I will report later.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Finally, I do not believe we can obtain major relaxation of Pakistan
                            views on relations with India through further reaffirmation of US
                            commitments to Pakistan in the event of attack. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that on such matters Pakistan

                                >Rusk</persName> learned in a conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> on May 2 that the idea of
                            introducing a mediator into the deadlocked negotiations over Kashmir had
                            been raised by <persName>Nehru</persName> in a conversation between
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> and Lord Mountbatten before <persName
                                corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> arrived in New Delhi.
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> envisioned someone of international
                            stature, unconnected with the ongoing talks, who would study the Kashmir
                            problem and put forward possible lines for a solution. (<gloss

                            32-1 INDIA-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">PAK</gloss>)</note> can be worked out
                        it is on as far as <persName>Nehru</persName> is concerned. Secretary added
                        that he talked with <persName>Nehru</persName> privately today and asked
                        where the Kashmir talks went next. <persName>Nehru</persName> knocked down
                        idea of independence for Vale, but Secretary felt <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        used rather desultory arguments. Same true of condominium.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> feared as usual that if ceasefire line
                        relaxed, hordes would pour in from Pakistan-held Kashmir and inundate Indian
                        portion.</p>
                    <p>2. Secretary said he had indicated to <persName>Nehru</persName> that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> had recounted to him
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> own talk with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>, in which idea of mediator had emerged.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> said that if Indians proposed this, <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s would turn <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571"
                            facs="0597"/>down. Secretary gave <persName>Nehru</persName> to
                        understand that idea would be explored with <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s and that we would be in touch with
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> again. Secretary said that at end of
                        conversation <persName>Nehru</persName> unquestionably knew what he
                        (Secretary) had in mind doing, and that Secretary was acting on assumption
                        that such a proposal was all right with <persName>Nehru</persName>.
                        Ambassador pointed out <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Radhakrishnan</persName>
                        had mentioned mediation idea this afternoon at tea for Secretary and party,
                        and had specifically referred to Ellsworth Bunker as possible mediator.
                        Secretary noted <persName>Nehru</persName> had said this morning it
                        important “not let situation break down,” and that mediation should be
                        explored in lieu of further rounds. Summing up, Secretary said
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> clearly seemed agree that U.S. should explore
                        mediation idea with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Secretary
                        seeing <persName>Nehru</persName> briefly after PM's dinner tonight and this
                        would afford opportunity take final reading.</p>
                    <p>3. Discussion then turned to question of tactics with <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s. Ambassador suggested line with <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s should be that having sounded Indians out we think we can
                        get them accept U.S. or Britsh mediator; can we go back to Indians with
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> acceptance? <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> agreed, noting it could be said to
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s that since Indians clearly not
                        ready move forward on any precise proposals, what about mediation? We think
                        we can get <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to agree. Also noted however
                        that if reluctance encountered might be necessary put mediation proposal
                        more formally to both sides. Secretary thought two stages might be involved.
                        First would be to attempt bring <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s along.
                        If necessary, in second stage proposal could be put to both. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> noted <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s would doubtless fear that mediation proposal simply device
                        for spinning things out. Secretary said could be pointed out to <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s that mediation procedure is not something
                        that can go on forever, and that <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s should
                        test to see whether it mere device. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> suggested we take stance that proposal good news for
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s since they have always wanted it.
                        U.S. side noted that while <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s have wanted
                            US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> governmental intervention in
                        negotiations in expectation that this would operate in <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> favor, they might be less enthusiastic
                        about a mediator acting as a private individual.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> asked if <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE1">Eugene Black</persName> available. Ambassador said
                        Indians had indicated that difficult accept <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                            >Black</persName> now, as this would mean reversal of earlier decision
                        (i.e. rejection in 1962 of offer of <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                            >Black</persName>'s good offices).</p>
                    <p>5. Pickard asked if question of terms of reference for mediator had come up.
                        Secretary thought it best if mediator worked out his own as he went along,
                        since this not formal mediation procedure. <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> said he had in mind purely procedural matters, such
                        as that mediator would talk to both sides, explore possibilities of
                        settlement, propose basis for discussion between two sides or with him.
                        Secretary said maximum flexibility should be preserved; therefore thought
                        process should be started by finding appropriate individual and ask him
                        attempt straighten out <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0598"/>Kashmir
                        problem. Secretary also noted that more than Kashmir involved. It generally
                        agreed mediator's task would embrace “other related matters.”</p>
                    <p>6. Discussion also touched on question of time limit. Ambassador said process
                        of modifying attitudes and positions on both sides will take time and <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s must be persuaded of this. While work of
                        mediator moves forward, we must also go ahead with military aid decisions,
                        otherwise political climate here would become intolerable. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> agreed no time limit should be fixed,
                        but also noted that since <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s could hardly
                        raise Kashmir in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> while mediation going on,
                        they would not wish give up their freedom of action in this regard
                        indefinitely. This another factor which might impel <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s seek some limit. Secretary noted that in any case the
                        mediator himself would have in mind some general time limit beyond which he
                        would not extend his efforts unless some results in sight.</p>
                    <p>7. Meeting ended this point in order permit Secretary keep another
                        engagement. Agreed that Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName> would have further word after Secretary had seen
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> tonight.</p>

                        responsive on subject of China, and fully engaged when discussion turned to
                        Pakistan issues.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to South Asia.]</p>
                    <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0599"/>
                    <p>Secretary suggested that Chinese may have timed their attack on India last
                        fall with knowledge that Russian build-up was occurring in Cuba. They may
                        have considered that whether the missile plot succeeded or failed, US would
                        be likely to be fully occupied with Cuban crisis and thus unlikely to be
                        able to turn attention to actions in Himalayas. Chinese had had intelligence
                        personnel in Cuba and doubtless knew what was up. Secretary was not nearly
                        so sure that Russians knew about Chinese intentions toward India. Gundevia
                        agreed that later indications, specifically, an accusation by an East German
                        communist leader that the Chinese had mounted an attack on India without
                        consultation with the socialist parties, was further evidence that the
                        timing of the attack had come as a surprise to the European countries.</p>
                    <p>Turning to Indo-American relations, Secretary assured
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> that there was not the slightest reason to
                        doubt US sympathy and support to India in its conflict with China.</p>
                    <p>Pointing out that US not responsible for Kashmir problem, which is result of
                        other peoples' unfinished business, Secretary said in American national
                        interest we must be concerned with security of entire subcontinent. If India
                        and Pakistan should develop close, cordial and cooperative relations,
                        subcontinent would be invulnerable; no nation would dare attack it. If, on
                        other hand, India-Pakistani differences vitiated national efforts it would
                        be difficult to support American efforts to help defend these countries.
                        Thus US has strong and specific interest in settlement of problem just as it
                        does in supporting India against Chinese threat. Emphasized that with a
                        million men in uniform stationed outside the US, every American family is
                        vitally concerned such problems. <persName>Nehru</persName> referred to
                        Chinese attack on India and to Sino-Soviet relations which he described as
                        not merely ideological, but also reflecting a clash of national interests.
                        He said that “possibly” China would not attack India this summer, but the
                        longer range prospect was more uncertain. He showed that he continues to
                        feel the heavy pressure of further prospective Chinese aggression.</p>
                    <p>On Indo-Pakistan relations, <persName>Nehru</persName> embarked on long
                        account of familiar facts of pre-independence Hindu-Muslim relations and of
                        post-independence Indo-Pakistan quarrels. Called Kashmir the result rather
                        than the cause of “anti-Hindu” and “anti-India” policies of Pakistan.
                        Secretary told of concerns he had heard expressed in Pakistan that some
                        Indian leaders do not accept partition, thus not just Kashmir, but the
                        existence of Pakistan itself would seem to be issue between two countries.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> accepted that the Indian leaders have been
                        reluctant to accept partition but emphasized in long historical statement
                        that ultimately they had, in fact, done so. Then asked how they can persuade
                        the doubting Pakistanis of this. India, but not Pakistan, has been ruled by
                        popular leaders. Indian leaders had thought the Pakistani hatred of India
                        would <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0600"/>die down, and so far as
                        people concerned it has. Nevertheless, it has been kept alive by
                        politicians. Some might say that Kashmir issue keeps it alive. He wanted the
                        Secretary to know that Indians wanted to solve the Kashmir issue, but cannot
                        do so at the cost of other relationships. Trouble is that Pakistanis blame
                        Indians for everything, even their troubles in East Pakistan, though India
                        has nothing to do with that. Nevertheless, Indian leaders are worried
                        because anything that happens in Pakistan affects India. India wants good
                        relations with Pakistan. Secretary suggested that if present hurdles could
                        be got over, new areas of cooperation could be found and maximum frontiers
                        could become less important. He recalled that in western Europe settlement
                        of Saar had made possible almost breath-taking progress in common
                        institutions. <persName>Nehru</persName> said that Indians had same idea,
                        unless something untoward happens. He assured Secretary that on no account
                        would India upset the partition. Secretary spoke again of our keen interest
                        in relationships with India, looking at the question from perspective of our
                        own burdens and responsibilities. If India is again attacked by the Chinese,
                        the US is and will remain India's friend. No question about that; it has to
                        do with overriding crises of our time. When we see the difference between
                        the safety of the subcontinent if the two countries—India and Pakistan—work
                        together, or if they don't we utter “a cry of anguish” at the present
                        situation.</p>
                    <p><persName>Nehru</persName> said that with regard to Kashmir he believed India
                        might well have come to agreement with Pakistan already but for fact <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s had been encouraged by <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and to some extent by US.</p>
                    <p>Secretary observed that one point he need not conceal is that our people
                        believe just powers of government derived from consent of governed. With
                        regard to Kashmir or other issues, we can't avoid this at home. He hoped
                        Prime Minister understood that. <persName>Nehru</persName> said he quite
                        understood then launched into description <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1"
                            >UNCIP</gloss> processes culminating with assertion that constituent
                        assembly in Kashmir, elected by people, confirmed Kashmir's accession to
                        India. He said premier Indian [objection?] to plebiscite is that it likely
                        to so arouse Islamic sentiments as to bring trouble to minorities in Kashmir
                        and India generally.</p>
                    <p>At this stage Prime Minister and Secretary excused other participants for
                        private talk.</p>

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>There is little evidence of a desire in either Pakistan or India to
                            work hard toward a general reconciliation which would involve major
                            concessions on Kashmir. There seems to be somewhat more readiness in
                            Karachi than in New Delhi to make substantial moves away from starting
                            positions, but it is also Karachi which gains from changes in the status
                            quo.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It is most unlikely that a Kashmir settlement can be negotiated which
                            would not cause serious difficulties for both governments internally. It
                            would help if such an agreement could be cushioned by far-reaching
                            agreements on other matters in order that the pain of Kashmir could be
                            outweighed by obvious advantages which one or the other might find
                            elsewhere. Nothing less than a Franco-German type of reconciliation is
                            likely to work. India is more ready for this than Pakistan; the latter
                            appears most reluctant to ease pressures on Kashmir by discussing or
                            agreeing on other questions prior to a Kashmir settlement. Further, the
                            absence of such a settlement leaves the two parties in an atmosphere of
                            unreasoning hostility which militates against good results on other
                            issues. This adds up to a difficult, but not insuperable, problem of
                            diplomatic procedure.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There is a wide gap between India and Pakistan on the nature of the
                            threat which each faces. Each undoubtedly holds its point of view in
                            good faith, but each also exaggerates for our benefit. India wants
                            large-scale military assistance on the ground that it is being encircled
                            by China: along their common borders, in Nepal and Bhutan, in Burma, in
                            Southeast Asia, and to a degree through the animosity of Pakistan.
                            Pakistan, on the other hand, sees a minimum of threat from China to the
                            subcontinent and thinks that India is determined in the long run to
                            absorb its smaller neighbors: Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma and Ceylon.
                            Pakistan adds that this kind of expansionist India would either join the
                            communist bloc or work intimately with it against Western
                            interests.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Pakistan pretends to be convinced that India has never accepted
                            partition and seeks the disappearance of Pakistan. This fear is given
                                <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0602"/>some support by
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>'s repeated rejection of Jinnah's
                            “two-nation theory,” that is, a rejection of a religious base for
                            statehood. This is easily converted in Pakistan into a rejection by
                            India of the fact of two states in the subcontinent. I spoke to
                                <persName>Nehru</persName> about this confusion and urged him to
                            take further steps to clarify that he accepts partition as a permanent
                            solution.</item>

                                    etc. Present Indian military leadership has had little practical
                                    experience beyond the brigade level. We and the British ought to
                                    get at this as high priority assistance.</item>

                                    have for years made such purchases, indirectly supported by our

                                    assistance. Perhaps defense production should be handled in the

                        <item>The views indicated above are related to the period of Mr.
                                <persName>Nehru</persName>'s leadership in India. Despite the fact
                            that he is slowing down somewhat, he still dominates the scene on the
                            more important policy questions. I am not sanguine about a Kashmir
                            settlement while he is Prime Minister. Nor do I believe that a heavy
                            investment in Indian defense would cause him to accept defense
                            responsibilities outside India, with the possible exception of Burma. He
                            will remain “unaligned” in an effort to obtain some help from the Soviet
                            Union against China; if this fails the chances are that he would go to
                            considerable lengths to make peace with China. I could be wrong.
                                Post-<persName>Nehru</persName>, the situation in India could be
                            quite different, both in respect to Pakistan and in East-West
                            relations.</item>

                        Commonwealth Relations Office London and I saw President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> in Rawalpindi late this afternoon to
                        present Kashmir mediator suggestion. Shahi and Shafqat of <gloss

                        inconclusive but not <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0604"/>wholly
                        discouraging. <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> presented letter
                        from <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> urging acceptance of
                        proposal (Delhi's 4290 to Department).<note n="1" xml:id="d291fn1">Dated May
                            5. (Ibid.)</note> President read <persName corresp="#p_SD1"
                            >Sandys</persName>' letter in our presence and said he wished to
                        consider proposal further with his colleagues. He seemed disappointed that
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> had not pursued in Delhi
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s proposal for special
                        status for Vale.</p>
                    <p>2. President's immediate reaction was that mediator would be ineffectual
                        without authority to make authoritative recommendations to US and <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> about military aid to India. He was deeply
                        concerned about recent reports in Delhi on military aid and pressed very
                        hard argument that mediator's efforts would be foredoomed to failure unless
                        US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> decisions on further military aid
                        to India were made dependent on Indian acceptance his Kashmir settlement
                        recommendations.</p>
                    <p>3. He argued appointment of one man as mediator would be dangerous and a
                        panel might be needed. He felt that most of mediator's work would need be
                        done in Delhi and that he would not want any <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> action to detract from validity of <gloss
                            target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> resolutions. He asked whether mediator
                        could not work within framework these resolutions.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> deprecated present ministerial
                        negotiations as futile and thought there was no possible utility in
                        scheduled sixth round, which should at least be postponed. He felt sure that
                        no progress would be possible without the exertion of pressure on India.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> and I stressed importance of
                        new approach as only promising alternative to sterile current series of
                        ministerial level talks. President admitted situation would be somber if
                        talks collapsed with no new procedure adopted.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> quoted from <persName
                            corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>'s statement in Commons on May 3
                        and <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>' statement in Delhi on May
                        4 in effort to reassure <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and I
                        quoted from US official sources as to logic of discussing Kashmir settlement
                        and arms aid to India together. President still seemed to feel deeply that
                        only threat of withholding aid would induce India to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>7. President said he recognized some good features in our proposal, and he
                        did not refute our observation that Pakistan traditionally has favored
                        interposition of third party into negotiations. He said he of course would
                        not make a final decision on a matter of such moment without reflection and
                        consultation with his advisors. He said he would see Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in Dacca beginning May 7
                        and suggested that <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> and I meet
                        him again in Dacca evening May 8, just before his departure for Kathmandu.
                        He expected to have a reply by that time. In the meanwhile he thought we
                        might wish to talk with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> who is
                        arriving Karachi from Larkana midday May 6.</p>
                    <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0605"/>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> and I plan to see <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in Karachi shortly after his arrival
                        here. <persName corresp="#p_JSM1">James</persName> is seeking separate
                        appointment with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> for <persName
                            corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> after he arrives from Bombay midday
                        May 6.</p>
                    <p>9. President's first reaction with us not encouraging; but there seemed to be
                        an element of poker in his attitude toward us and it is possible that after
                        his and our discussions with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                        and after further consideration by him our rebuttal of his arguments for
                        putting our military aid program in hands of mediator as a pressure
                        instrument, he may take a more favorable view. The crucial problem remains
                        his concern about military aid to India.</p>
                    <p>10. In view of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s reluctant
                        attitude which seemed to imply that he would be doing us a favor if he
                        accepted, I said on departure that he should not act on assumption that
                        proposal was advanced primarily in our own interest. Suggestion was put
                        forward because we thought it offered best chance of reaching a settlement
                        by two countries directly concerned. We expected him to consider matter on
                        basis of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> interest and not US
                        interest.</p>

                            Communist China. To make all military assistance contingent on Kashmir

                            Thus, it is unlikely either to antagonize the Pakistanis or reduce our

                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Indians might reject proposal</hi>—but even if they did
                        our offer would serve the important purpose of demonstrating our willingness
                        to stand behind them in the event of another attack. Last November and
                        December <persName>Nehru</persName> twice asked for an arrangement along the
                        lines of our proposal. But since then, the Indians have shifted their
                        emphasis to building up their own air force. They may, therefore, interpret
                        our offer as a device to defer their acquisition of comparable capability of
                        their own. Our willingness to begin the installation of permanent radars
                        will reduce this Indian reaction.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Repercussions within India</hi>—The key here is Nehru.
                        If he decides that our proposal is necessary for India's defense and can be
                        reconciled with nonalignment, public opinion will follow his lead, except
                        for the extreme left. But if Nehru rejects our offers, the controversy
                        between rightist and leftist elements over India's evolving relationship
                        with the West is likely to intensify. The fact that the proposed arrangement
                        does not involve a firm mutual defense commitment will help.</p>
                    <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Repercussions in Pakistan</hi>—We shall, of course, have
                        to explain to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> what we plan to do
                        before we approach the Indians officially on air defense. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and others recognize that this is a
                        major step available to us in strengthening India against Communist China
                        that does not significantly affect the military balance within the
                        subcontinent. They see such an arrangement as being in lieu of a comparable
                        build-up of the Indian Air Force. Nevertheless, some Pakistanis will react
                        emotionally.</p>
                    <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Repercussions in Asian neutralist states</hi>—The
                        Chinese Communists will use the proposed arrangement in their efforts to
                        discredit India in these states by portraying it as a vassal of the United
                        States. These states, however, are likely to be less affected by Chinese
                        Communist rhetoric than by the demonstration inherent in our proposal of
                        Western willingness <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0608"/>to commit its
                        power toward the containment of Chinese Communist expansionism.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. British Reluctance</hi></p>
                    <p>We expect the British to hold back. They are worried about the consequences
                        of a direct confrontation between the <gloss target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss>
                        and Chinese Communist bombers over India—including Chinese reprisals against
                        Hong Kong. They are also worried about repercussions of an air defense
                        proposal for India in Pakistan. And, in any event, they think we should hold
                        off pending some progress on Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>We think we have good arguments to counter these British reservations. If the
                        Chinese attack India again, the consequences are likely to be far-reaching
                        in any event, and the air defense arrangement will probably decrease the
                        likelihood of such an attack. The air defense arrangement is less costly in
                        terms of Pakistani repercussions than almost anything else we might do for
                        India of military significance. And we can argue at length that if we do
                        nothing at all for India in the near future, our capacity to push the
                        Indians into a reasonable posture on Kashmir may actually diminish.</p>
                    <p>Next Steps</p>
                    <p>1. United States Approach to the British</p>
                    <p>We should make every effort to bring the British to a political decision to
                        move ahead with us. We should try to secure their agreement to provide two
                            <gloss target="#t_RAF1">RAF</gloss> squadrons while we contribute one
                        from the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>. We should also try to
                        persuade the British to work out at least token contributions from Canada
                        and Australia, recognizing that the joint air defense team found that
                        neither of these countries had the resources to provide a major
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>2. United States/United Kingdom/Commonwealth Approach to the Indians</p>
                    <p>Once we have persuaded the British, with or without Canada and Australia, to
                        join us, we should make a joint approach to the Government of India. The
                        tone of this approach would be that we are responding to an Indian request
                        after a careful technical review which indicates that the proposed
                        arrangement provides the only feasible method of providing a significant
                        increase in India's air defense capability in a timely enough manner to be
                        effective during the current critical period. We would indicate that we did
                        not consider the proposed arrangement a permanent substitute for an
                        effective Indian force. We would not, however, discuss how long we expected
                        the arrangement to continue in specific terms, nor would we commit ourselves
                        to providing India with supersonic interceptors of its own at some future
                        date.</p>

                    <p>Having reached agreement in principle, the governments concerned would work
                        out the necessary details, including status of forces, facilities, and
                        arrangements for the ground environment. The resulting understandings would
                        be formalized, as necessary. Meanwhile, technical representatives of the
                        respective air forces would consult and lay the groundwork for rotational
                        exercises.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Rotational Exercises</hi></p>
                    <p>These would involve intermittent peacetime deployment to India by designated

                            >RAF</gloss> squadrons for air defense exercises with the Indian Air
                        Force. The United States element of the joint air defense team found such
                        exercises essential to ensure effective deployment for combat operations
                        during a militarily acceptable period after the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

                        military recommendations, adding that the Joint Chiefs of Staff questioned
                        the military utility of stationing U.S. air squadrons in India. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> summarized the Chiefs'
                        views, emphasizing that in their opinion any commitment to defend India
                        involves a very heavy additional commitment for which no additional forces
                        are provided. The Chiefs are concerned that in deciding on the proposed
                        defense arrangements consideration be given to the broad implications for

                        air defense arrangements for India but want this problem looked at in the

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
                        recommended arrangements provided for the deployment to India of two mobile
                        radars which would be left there. These radars, taken from our own forces,
                        would be replaced promptly. He asked that any reference in the
                        recommendation to the installation of <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> radar
                        facilities be removed.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Indians now want the kind of an air defense
                        commitment we are prepared to give jointly with the British. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded by acknowledging
                        that there is greater doubt of Indian acceptance now than there was
                        immediately after the Chinese Communist attack. Nevertheless, he is
                        convinced that the Indians would accept our offer. He suggested that we
                        obtain British agreement to a joint commitment for air defense before we
                        informed the Indians of what we are prepared to do.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the commitment “to consult with the Government of
                        India in the event of a Chinese Communist attack on India regarding the
                        possible use of U.S. military air forces to strengthen India's air defense”
                        means that we are really committed to defend India. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded that “consult” actually means
                        a commitment to defend.</p>
                    <p>Secretary Dillon<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">Secretary of the Treasury
                                <persName>C. Douglas Dillon</persName>.</note> noted that the paper
                        did not discuss how the U.S. commitment to defend India would be dealt with
                        domestically. He predicted that Congress would view this commitment as of
                        major importance. He urged that full consultation with Congressional leaders
                        be undertaken in order to forestall criticism of the use of an executive
                        agreement to commit the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that possibly
                        the use of “executive agreement” was not necessary and was perhaps overly
                        formal. In his <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0611"/>view the President
                        could decide as a matter of policy to consult with the Indians in the event
                        of a Chinese Communist attack.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it was obvious we would defend India if attacked. He
                        thought that our offer should cover the defense of India's large cities, not
                        the defense of the frontiers of India on the ground. He said that we could
                        argue out this question with the Congress and believed that we should go
                        ahead now with the U.K. and the Indians and talk about our action to the
                        Congress later. If the Chinese attacked India, he predicted that everyone
                        would be in favor of defending the Indians.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">David E. Bell</persName>.</note> pointed
                        out that Congressmen would not oppose our defending India if attacked by
                        Communist China, but they would hammer hard as to whether we should offer
                        such a commitment to India without having forced India to settle the Kashmir
                        question.</p>
                    <p>The President responded by asking when we should start telling Congress that
                        we doubted there would be any settlement now of the Kashmir question.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded by saying
                        that he was making a foreign policy report to a Congressional Committee next
                        week and during his presentation could begin the process of educating
                        Congressmen about the declining prospects of an agreement. He pointed out,
                        however, that even if there is no settlement of the Kashmir problem, we
                        cannot walk away from India if the Chinese Communists attack.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that it would be unwise for us to make it appear that the
                        failure of the Kashmir negotiations was <persName>Nehru</persName>'s fault.
                        He said we could point to the unreasonable demands made by the
                        Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we must not
                        think that giving India a commitment on air defense is in lieu of further
                        military aid. He recommended that we ask the British to move promptly to
                        ship spare parts to the Indian air forces. He also hoped that our assistance
                        could be made available to build roads and civil projects in the frontier
                        area—a means of assistance which would not inflame the Pakistanis.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded that
                        only a small amount of money could be spent constructing roads and that such
                        roads would add very little to India's military capability. He believed that
                        the Indians could use profitably no more than $50 million of additional U.S.
                        military assistance. He said that because they had insufficient
                        non-commissioned officers, they could expand their forces so quickly that
                        the overall effect would be to decrease their military capability. The $50
                        million figure can be justified and there is no equipment in this which
                        would inflame the Pakistanis. The minimum of $10 million should be
                        forthcoming from the British for spare parts. India's transport aircraft
                        capability can be greatly <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>improved
                        by shipping spare parts and increasing the logistic support now
                        available.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> acknowledged that
                        the essential factor is to increase realism among India's military planners.
                        Some progress has been made. For example, Indian ideas of a force of
                        1,400,000 has been reduced to 1,000,000. This planning figure should be
                        further reduced to 800,000. The military budget figure of $1,800,000,000 is
                        too high and would endanger India's civilian economy unless it were
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                        favorably peacetime air defense exercises in India as something we can do
                        which is of real help.</p>
                    <p>The President, noting the importance of discussions with Congressmen, asked
                        that a paper be prepared containing our plans for informing Congress and the
                        Indians. He suggested in passing that possibly we could get the Indians to
                        persuade the British to join us in the air defense commitment. He commented
                        that if the West loses India, no one really could care about the future of
                        Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> cautioned that we
                        could not expect to get U.K. support for a joint air defense commitment at
                        once. He predicted that the British would stall.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the British attitude. Several members responded by
                        indicating that the British were hesitant to antagonize the Communist
                        Chinese because of the effect on the future status of Hong Kong, and, in
                        addition, hesitated to jeopardize their trade with the Communist Chinese by
                        taking a political action which the Chinese would consider hostile.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that even if the British refused to join with us in
                        making a commitment, we should proceed with U.S./Indian air defense
                        exercises.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that we might
                        persuade the Australians to join with us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said he believed the British would be unable
                        to turn down our proposal. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                            >McNamara</persName> agreed, but called attention again to the
                        likelihood that the British would stall by saying that we should not make a
                        joint U.S./U.K. offer to India until the Indians are prepared to settle the
                        Kashmir dispute.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we could talk in
                        very tentative terms to Indian Defense Coordination Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName> who will be coming to
                        Washington shortly.</p>
                    <p>The President asked why we wanted the British to join us in the air defense
                        commitment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responded
                        by saying that the American people will insist that others help us in a task
                        which, world-wide, we cannot do all alone. He said we would be criticized if
                        the British did not join us on the grounds that India was a member of the
                        British <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0613"/>Commonwealth, and,
                        therefore, the British should participate in its defense. We need, he added,
                        other flags in this effort.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to
                        prepare a paper for him giving plans covering consultations with the
                        British, discussions with Congressmen, and information to the Indians. He
                        asked that a paper be prepared as to what we would tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName> in order that he would not
                        return to India empty-handed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we will raise
                        with <persName corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName> the importance of
                        an agreed estimate as to the nature of the Chinese threat and of the Indian
                        military requirements necessary to defeat the Communists. At present the
                        Indians overestimate what the Chinese Communists can do militarily.</p>
                    <p>The President returned to a memorandum sent to him by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d293fn5">In this
                            9-page memorandum, prepared on May 4 and sent to <persName

                            6, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> outlined what he saw as
                            the key issues affecting U.S.-Indian relations, and offered his
                            recommendations concerning those issues. (Kennedy Library, National
                            Security Files, Countries Series, India, General, 5/6/63-5/8/63)</note>
                        and summarized its main recommendation, i.e. we must agree to defend India
                        in the event of a Communist Chinese attack. This commitment must be made
                        promptly lest the Indians turn from us and make terms with the Chinese
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that we must
                        assist India, but it was not necessary for us to make a flat commitment to
                        defend India. The proposal was to agree to consult with respect to the air
                        defense of India in the event of attack.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his view that we should consider now a flat guarantee
                        of the territorial integrity of India. He noted that at the time an attack
                        took place we would obviously decide to defend India. Because this is true,
                        he thought that we should go some of the way now toward gaining the benefits
                        prior to an attack of a defense commitment.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked that we take a
                        broader look at the problem. He felt that the basic issue was not the air
                        defense of India but rather how we can cope with Communist China over the
                        next decade. He doubted that it would be possible to deal with the Chinese
                        on the ground in non-nuclear warfare.</p>
                    <p>The President responded that India would obviously take a firmer stand toward
                        Communist China if we were committed to India's defense. In addition, our
                        commitment would serve as a deterrent to a Chinese Communist attack. He
                        compared the Indian situation to the Korean situation as it existed in
                        1950.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed his view
                        that before we gave a full commitment to India, we must take into account
                        the fact that the defense <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0614"/>of India
                        will involve the use of nuclear weapons. He mentioned that the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff were prepared to reduce the size of U.S. and Korean forces in Korea
                        as long as we were prepared to say that the defense of Korea would involve
                        the use of nuclear weapons. He expanded on the necessity of facing the
                        prompt use of nuclear weapons in the event of attack if we were to reduce in
                        peacetime the level of forces in Korea. He stated his view that he preferred
                        the use of nuclear weapons to the use of U.S. forces on the ground in Asia.
                        Secretary Ball cautioned that if we are thinking of shifting our strategy to
                        one calling for the use of nuclear weapons in Asia, then we should be aware
                        of the reaction which might occur in Asia, i.e. we are prepared to use
                        nuclear weapons against yellow people but are not prepared to use them
                        against white people in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made clear that he
                        was not now recommending a change in strategy, but he felt that there is a
                        requirement that we be clear in our own minds about the use of nuclear
                        weapons before we make additional commitments.</p>
                    <p>The President said if we were overrun in Korea, in Formosa, or in Western
                        Europe, we would obviously use nuclear weapons. If we are prepared to defend
                        Korea and Thailand, he asked why we should not be prepared to commit
                        ourselves to defend India. He again asked whether our guarantees to the
                        Indians would not be a deterrent to a Chinese Communist attack. In his view
                        the air defense is the key to the existing situation. He said he was
                        prepared to proceed with the shipment of the radars and with the air defense
                        training program, even if the British would not join us. He suggested that
                        for now we would conduct intermittent peacetime air defense exercises with
                        earmarked squadrons of air defense aircraft. Later, we could propose a
                        guarantee. He still wondered whether the Indians would consider our offer as
                        it now stands.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> concluded the discussion
                        by pointing out that our objective is the defense of the Indian
                        subcontinent. Our hope is that we can help the whole subcontinent rather
                        than be obliged to defend countries in the subcontinent, one by one.</p>

                    <p>6016. Eyes Only for the Ambassador. Following message from President to Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> has been relayed to
                        Prime Minister by other channels:</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Verbatim Text.</hi></p>
                    <p>“Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                    <p>With the return of our delegations from Karachi and Delhi, I am inclined to
                        think we ought to go ahead now on the ‘air defense' arrangements for India
                        recommended by our Joint Mission. These would involve chiefly periodic
                        exercises of say three earmarked Commonwealth/US squadrons, plus temporary
                        provision of certain radars. I would envision our presenting this publicly
                        as joint training missions, though of course our underlying intent would be
                        clear. We have gone into this scheme thoroughly here and my reasoning is as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>With a Kashmir settlement now a long way off, and <persName>Nehru</persName>
                        in an unyielding mood, I believe it would be a mistake to let the Indians
                        conclude that there is little prospect of any further military help in the
                        absence of a Kashmir settlement. I note that you too were careful to counter
                        this impression in your recent parliamentary statement. Indian support is so
                        essential to a satisfactory non-nuclear balance of power in Asia that we
                        don't want to risk unduly any Indian backsliding from their new
                        determination to counter the Chinese Communist threat. They still think they
                        have other options, and if we push <persName>Nehru</persName> too hard it is
                        by no means inconceivable that he would harden his attitude toward Pakistan
                        rather than the reverse. Indeed he might transfer to us some of his current
                        animosity toward Peiping, attempt to disengage from his confrontation with
                        the Chinese, and rely primarily on the hope, however illusory, of
                        substantial Soviet military help. His current mood and past performances
                        warn us not to push him too hard.</p>
                    <p>So our problem is how to forestall jeopardizing our new relationship with
                        India, without putting too much strain on our relations with Pakistan, and
                        still retaining some leverage on Kashmir. It seems to me that to signify
                        willingness to go ahead on air defense would best meet this dilemma. This
                        would: (1) lend credibility to our intent to help India if attacked again;
                        (2) be the least expensive gesture we could make, since it involves mostly
                        earmarking our own forces; (3) be the gesture least <pb n="591"
                            xml:id="pg_591" facs="0617"/>offensive to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s, since it entails no build-up of Indian air; (4) last but
                        not least, buy us time to stall a bit longer on what the Indians really
                        want, i.e., substantial hardware to build up their own forces. In
                        particular, such an arrangement would enable us to go slow on what is likely
                        to be the most expensive element in any US/Commonwealth aid program,
                        developing an all-weather interceptor component for the Indian air
                        force.</p>
                    <p>I am quite aware of your Government's hesitations over the risks involved in
                        such an arrangement. These we share, though we do not regard the actual
                        likelihood of air attack on Indian cities as very high, even if the Chinese
                        attacked again on the ground. And in the last analysis it is almost
                        inconceivable to me that we would allow an overt Chinese Communist air
                        attack on Indian cities without becoming involved. In fact, I am strongly
                        persuaded by the argument that a visible US/<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>/Commonwealth ‘commitment' to the air defense of India is the
                        best means of deterring such an attack from occurring and thus involving us
                        in the first place. To be sure, we would have other avenues of retaliation
                        if an air attack occurred, but certainly defensive action in India would be
                        the one least, rather than most, likely to lead to escalation.</p>
                    <p>Thus I see many cogent reasons for going ahead on air defense, and feel we
                        should put this matter high on our agenda; hopefully we could say something
                        to TTK when he is here. Incidentally, I look on your efforts to increase the
                        effectiveness of the existing Indian Air Force units as an important
                        complement to air defense assistance, and I am pleased to learn that your
                        plans are now made to move ahead intensively with this program.</p>
                    <p>I would be much interested in your own views.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        to Indian defence since the Chinese attack and, as you know, we have a heavy
                        commitment in Malaysia which so far we have to bear on our own. Therefore
                        any further military aid to Indian will have to be pretty limited although
                        we shall do our best having regard to all the aid we are giving on the civil
                        side. I think we should be very chary about holding out expectations of a
                        series of instalments. All this is just tinkering with the problem because
                        no sensible defence of India is possible except as a planned part of the
                        defence of the sub-continent as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The air umbrella plan, however, raises much more difficult and far-reaching
                        questions. It is true that periodic exercises of a few squadrons of aircraft
                        would be a cheaper way of bolstering the Indian defence and would perhaps be
                        less offensive to Pakistan than any other form of military aid.
                        Nevertheless, we do feel that such an arrangement might involve both of us
                        in very far-reaching commitments. I cannot get out of my mind the situation
                        which confronted this country in 1914 when as a result of what were intended
                        to be only precautionary arrangements the bulk of the French fleet was moved
                        to the Mediterranean and Britain thus became morally committed to the
                        defence of the North Sea and so to war with Germany. The initial object of
                        the squadrons training in India would be to permit a rather similar
                        re-deployment of the Indian Air Force; to let them take up forward
                        positions. So I believe that we must both reflect carefully before we
                        undertake a military commitment, however limited it may be at the outset,
                        which might either involve us in actual shooting with the Chinese or at
                        least enable the Indians to claim that as any Chinese attack developed we
                        were morally committed to increase our active participation in India's
                        defence with all that that might imply both for you and for us. Of course,
                        if China really sets out to conquer India or SE Asia that would be quite
                        another situation and one in which we would both have to react. But what I
                        do not like is the idea of putting ourselves now in a position where we
                        should ultimately no longer have a free choice. Meanwhile, we should have
                        little control or even influence on India's conduct of her foreign
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>We also have a further difficulty in our minds. In the first moments of panic
                        after the Chinese invasion the Indians seemed disposed to adopt a more
                        realistic attitude both towards the Kashmir dispute and on the <pb n="593"
                            xml:id="pg_593" facs="0619"/>subject of ‘non-alignment.' As the danger
                        has receded, so their traditional attitudes have reasserted themselves.
                        Indeed we doubt whether in fact <persName>Nehru</persName> would now be
                        prepared to agree to the air umbrella. The only thing which would certainly
                        change the Indian attitude would be renewed and acute fear of Chinese
                        aggression. But if the Indians feel that we are already committed to their
                        air defence without any effort on their part to contribute to a common
                        defence policy for the whole sub-continent in alliance with the West, they
                        may well be less and not more ready to take a realistic view.</p>
                    <p>We shall have to discuss all these issues further when you and I have had our
                        talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName>.
                        Meanwhile, I hope that we can both avoid any commitment about the air
                        umbrella.</p>
                    <p>With warm regard,</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by
                        saying we must go ahead with help to India but do so in a way which would
                        not drive the Pakistanis off the reservation. On the other hand we couldn't
                        give the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s a veto. We also wanted to
                        bring the Commonwealth along with us. It was not in our interests to
                        “compromise” Indian non-alignment, lest we promote a Soviet-Chinese
                        rapprochement which would greatly up our bill.</p>
                    <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0620"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought we could do a number of
                        things for the Indians to keep nursing them along. He mentioned C-119s,
                        radar and air training. As to defense production, he suggested that we and
                        others might increase our contributions to the Indian consortium so that the
                        Indians themselves could buy more defense production items.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> interjected that we would get little
                        political credit for the C-119s since we had told the Indians in April these
                        would be coming. He had explained to TTK<note n="1" xml:id="d297fn1"

                        some way to help India on its air defense problem and had had no negative
                        reaction from TTK on an air defense package.</p>
                    <p>The President said “if the C-119s were already discounted what are we going
                        to give the Indians to take back?” He further asked “Is it really right that
                        we get more advantages out of non-alignment?” The Soviets might work harder
                        to subvert India under these circumstances but this wouldn't hurt us too
                        much. He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that perhaps
                        we ought to try and give credits which could be used by the Indians for
                        arms. He asked why we shouldn't have more credit sales of defense items in
                        general. <persName>Bundy</persName> explained the $100 million revolving
                        fund limitation imposed by the Congress and that any credit sales were a
                        charge against the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriation. The
                        President thought that next year we should ask to put this limitation up
                        $100 million more.</p>
                    <p><persName>Bundy</persName> returned to his description of <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> thinking on aid to India. As to supersonic
                        aircraft we would have a hard time finding them. We should go ahead,
                        however, on air defense radar because the Indians needed it in any case.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> interjected that the real
                        problem was getting the Indians into a position to use <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aid. They were not really logistically
                        prepared to do so. The President commented that if they ask for $1.3 billion
                        and we give them $50 million, there will be “real disillusionment.” He then
                        asked about the project for rotating US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        squadrons to India. It wouldn't cost much, it wouldn't give the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s much pain, so why not go ahead without the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> if necessary. We should do a paper on
                        two squadrons for training exercises plus radar and whatever else was
                        necessary, so that we could get ahead on this matter.</p>
                    <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0621"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought it most important that we
                        have some “Commonwealth flags” in the Indian aid effort. He urged that we
                        give TTK the idea that we were thinking positively and get him to work on
                        the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to be more forthcoming.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> thought that $ 10-20 million a year in
                        subsequent aid was the most we could get from the British. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said this was all the more reason for
                        going ahead with the air defense package. We should try to get other
                        Commonwealth countries in, if we couldn't get the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>. In fact, we should tell the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> this.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> entered a plea that we make the
                        Indians de facto allies instead of de facto associates. It was so important
                        to get India firmly on the side of the West against China that we should not
                        let TTK go away thinking that we were unwilling to really help. The
                        President said we should obviously do the least we could get away with
                        politically, but at the minimum some sort of a substantial response to India
                        was required. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought that we
                        should tell TTK that we were prepared to “go big” in principle.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> urged that we have one more crack
                        at Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> on air
                        defense. The President agreed that we should tell TTK we were thinking about
                        this and were consulting the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> urged that we hold off for a month
                        until Kashmir was better sorted out before going ahead on air defense.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, however, mentioned that
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> did not get mad at the air
                        defense proposition when <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> talked
                        with him in Pakistan. The President said we should feel out TTK and should
                        tell the Prime Minister that we ought to go ahead together but if they
                        didn't come along we would have to go ahead unilaterally. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we should keep telling the Indians
                        about the potential consequences for us of shooting down Chinese Communist
                        planes in India. This was a real commitment on our part because it could
                        involve us in a major war.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> commented that TTK must go
                        back with a clearer understanding that the subcontinent was indefensible
                        without the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s and that our aid would have
                        to be interim in nature until then. The President asked why <persName
                            corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> thought India indefensible without
                        Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s reply was that
                        Assam, the most vulnerable target area, could not be defended effectively
                        without East Pakistan. This was true also of an attack from Burma. He
                        further emphasized the costly diversion of India and Pakistan effort
                        entailed in the Kashmir dispute. The Indians, for example, still kept
                        substantial forces deployed against the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                        >Pak</gloss>s. Let's not give the Indians an idea that mediation was just an
                        exercise. So let's press TTK on Kashmir. Let's not forget our Pakistan
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The President started to sum up what we were going to tell TTK, and asked
                        Bill Bundy to describe what <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> had in mind.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> indicated that we would (1) couple the air
                        defense discussion with an offer on radar and training; (2) underwrite the
                        Ladakh air transport requirement; (3) push ahead with roadbuilding and
                        communication equipment; <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0622"/>(4)
                        suggest a joint survey of the ammunition and weapons requirements to support
                        a 16-division force base; and (5) would offer the Indians any training help
                        we could. The President asked how much our support would cost per division.
                        Bundy said a horseback figure would be $5 million in equipment plus several
                        times that in ammunition, depending on the stockage level agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that it would
                        be good to expose TTK to a movement of our Congressmen; we should talk to
                        TTK about how to handle them. The President asked who was setting up TTK's
                        meetings on the Hill. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> indicated that he was taking care of this.</p>

                        Discussion, which lasted one hour, was most businesslike.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> informed me that <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> is prepared to accept mediation with
                        certain safeguards. He said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> recognizes
                        utility of mediation in context of its basic desire for peaceful Kashmir
                        settlement, providing safeguards can be worked out.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> explained desire for
                        safeguards flowed from difficult position faced by <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss>. Past experience in Kashmir negotiations with India has led
                        Pakistan to distrust Indian tactics of obstinacy and delay. While Indians
                        during recent negotiations remained unshaken and obstinate, <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">
                            <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0623"/>Pak</gloss>s have made
                        concessions. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> fear there is risk
                        mediator, sensing contrast in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> and Indian
                        attitudes, will try to get Pakistan to go further and further in making
                        concessions while Indians sit tight. Second and basic problem concerning
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> is that Indians will spin out
                        negotiations and, under cover of mediation and seemingly conciliatory stance
                        it would convey, achieve their objectives of getting long-term military aid
                        from West without having to come to any Kashmir compromise. <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> needs some assurance against such stalling
                        tactics. Without such assurance, Pakistani public would feel <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> naive to accept mediation proposal which
                        would give Indians this opportunity. In effect, <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                            >GOP</gloss> faces real problem of justifying to public entering
                        immediately into new effort settle Kashmir question in view unproductive
                        bilateral talks.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> then spelled out four

                        questions on my part, spelled out these safeguards in following terms: <list>
                            <label>A)</label>
                            <item>Time Limit—Desire for time limit flowed from need prevent
                                indefinite spinning out of inconclusive negotiation by Indians.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said he had in
                                mind something like 3 to 6 months. He thought six months should be
                                enough for mediator, who would be man of stature and strong
                                personality, to familiarize himself with details and work out
                                proposals for solution. He recognized, however, danger of being
                                completely rigid and that absolute time limit would be construed by
                                Indians as ultimatum. While <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s
                                were open to suggestions on specifics, they wished some formula
                                which would convey to Pakistani public that time limit reasonably

                                        <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> position on this
                                    question not yet final. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                        >Ayub</persName>'s own view is that mediator should have
                                    authority to say how much and what type aid India would qualify
                                    for on basis of progress toward settlement. In effect he would
                                    thus be both arbitrator on arms aid and mediator on Kashmir.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said that he
                                    is trying to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                        >Ayub</persName> from pressing this idea, pointing out
                                    decisions on arms aid are reserved to governments and cannot be
                                    delegated to mediator. I noted such decision on aid bound to be
                                    outside scope of any mediator. <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                                        >Bhutto</persName> said he hoped to induce <persName

                                    but still needed to work on him.</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s own view on
                                    general relationship between arms aid decisions and mediation
                                    process not completely clear. He seemed to have in mind not
                                    specific threat to Indians to withhold arms aid but relating <pb

                                    congressional decisions on specifics of arms aid to progress on
                                    Kashmir settlement without any publicized specific linkage. He
                                    felt something along these lines would also be needed satisfy
                                        <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> public opinion. He
                                    suggested for example possibility of one or two prominent
                                    senators making statements differentiating aid which would be
                                    given merely as extension of Nassau Agreement from aid of a
                                    different magnitude which might be given if mediation
                                    successful. He also recognized that our hands could not be tied
                                    in the event Chinese Communists renewed attacks on India. He
                                    said “freeze” would specifically relate to new decisions and not
                                    to pipeline deliveries or, by inference, limited extension of
                                    Nassau commitment. He also did not argue with my point that we
                                    could not agree to direct and public linkage of arms aid to
                                    Kashmir settlement though these are questions which by nature of
                                    prevailing situation, must be considered together. After

                    <p>4053. Secretary used long talk with <persName corresp="#p_KTT1">T.T.
                            Krishnamachari</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J.
                            Desai</persName> May 17 to sound Indians out on air defense arrangement.
                        Recalled India had been reluctant to use combat air arm when <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s attacked last fall because of
                        concern over possible <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> retaliation
                        on Indian cities. Question now was what to do in future. First task is to
                        get existing Indian Air Force into best possible operational condition.
                        British are working on this. Then there is problem of radar. We have been
                        examining coverage of Delhi and Calcutta areas and believe we can arrange
                        for mobile radars for this task pending installation permanent radar, for
                        which lead time is up to 18 months. There is also communications and
                        training requirement. We are prepared to start right away on training.</p>
                    <p>Secretary then said there was one possibility, which had major international
                        and internal political implications, which he wanted to mention quite
                        tentatively: whether US and Commonwealth squadrons <pb n="600"
                            xml:id="pg_600" facs="0626"/>should take part in the defense of Indian
                        cities. Said we did not have Commonwealth agreement and had not come to
                        final conclusion but believed this important way in which we could reinforce
                        India's military. Noted that fly through of squadrons for training would
                        give signal to <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s and have deterrent
                        effect. Also noted this arrangement might give Indians political
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>At first TTK replied only briefly and then turned to another subject. Said
                        Indians had made “suggestion” of air defense arrangement when <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s attacked. They had thought visits of
                        Western squadrons might be camouflaged as joint US-<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss>-India training exercises. TTK then moved on to argue India's
                        case for three squadrons supersonics.</p>
                    <p>Subject came up briefly again when TTK mentioned his consultation re air
                        defense with Australians in same manner as he had previous day. Secretary
                        inquired whether there was possibility that Australian squadrons might come
                        to India in event of attack. TTK replied that Indians might discuss this;
                        proximity of Australia to India would be advantage.</p>
                    <p>Secretary returned to subject at close of conversation. Said we are now
                        thinking about possibility of external air squadrons assisting India in
                        event attack. Asked if this would give India political problems.</p>
                    <p>TTK replied it would be better if arrangement camouflaged so that squadrons
                        visiting in peacetime would appear be on joint training exercises. If attack
                        actually came, people would welcome arrangement. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1"
                            >M.J. Desai</persName> inquired if we would provide communications
                        equipment before arrival of squadrons on exercises. Secretary replied that
                        we would have to start with radar and related communications equipment. We
                        can begin this now. Question is whether we go on with squadrons.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J. Desai</persName> said he had raised this
                        question with <persName>Nehru</persName>. M.J. had told him that before
                        visit of squadrons, communications equipment would be in position. M.J.
                        considered that with this physical evidence of assistance to India's effort
                        to defend itself, there would be no objection to arrangement. Said it would
                        be better if it understood that during interval between <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> attack and arrival external squadrons
                        India must rely on own resources for air defense. For this purpose India
                        needed assistance in building its own air force (three supersonic
                        squadrons). If it were known that arrangement was cooperative plan designed
                        at least in part to build India's capacity defend itself, then there would
                        be no political problem. If, however, external squadrons merely assumed
                        India's air defense burdens, then would be problems.</p>

                    <p>TTK began by expressing India's thanks for the spontaneous US response to
                        India's appeal when it was attacked. He also brought personal regards to the
                        President from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                        >Nehru</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President inquired why the Chinese had attacked. What was the Indian
                        estimate? In response TTK gave him a written brief<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d300fn1">Not found.</note> prepared by <persName
                            corresp="#p_DMJ1">M.J. Desai</persName> which the President read and
                        said was extremely good. As TTK saw it, Chinese hostility toward India was a
                        matter of long standing but the exact time of the Chinese attack was related
                        to Cuba. The Chinese probably anticipated a “free ride” if Cuba flared up.
                        TTK went on to describe other evidences of Chinese infiltration since the
                        cease-fire. He pointed out that there were a number of Chinese in Nagaland
                        disguised as mule drivers. In North Burma there were 40-60,000 Chinese
                        settlers.</p>
                    <p>The President asked TTK what he thought was the objective of the Chinese
                        Communists in Asia. TTK responded as far as India was concerned the Chinese
                        probably sought to create a number of small satellite states around India's
                        borders, e.g. Nepal, an independent Assam, Burma. Chou En-lai had implied
                        this objective to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> and Ali
                        Sabri when they were in Peiping. Burma in TTK's opinion was “too far gone.”
                        Ne Win, however well-intentioned, could not control Tin Pe and the Commerce
                        Minister who were making over Burma into a Communist state.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about the Indian view of the future of non-alignment. TTK
                        rejoined that India hoped to remain non-aligned; basically, it didn't like
                        to expand the area of conflict with China. Rather, the Indians wanted to
                        localize this conflict and to deal with it themselves, “rather than to drag
                        our friends into the fray.” Second, the Indians hoped through this policy to
                        stay on the right side of the Soviets, and not push <pb n="602"
                            xml:id="pg_602" facs="0628"/>them back into helping Peiping. TTK did not
                        expect any further Soviet military aid to India, but hoped that Indian
                        policy could forestall such aid to China as well.</p>
                    <p>The President switched to the question of Kashmir. He said we had heard
                        gloomy news about the prospects for settlement. This was one of our
                        problems, as was that of Pakistani fears of India. However, apparently there
                        was some feeling in India that in pushing Kashmir “we were taking advantage
                        of a friend in her hour of need.” This was not so, but we had real problems
                        with the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. We had important intelligence
                        relations with them, and we did not want the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s in a “moment of violence” to destroy <gloss

                            >SEATO</gloss>. Also there was much sentiment in Congress that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> could easily settle Kashmir if he chose. But
                        the President felt that we must go ahead with India regardless of these
                        differences. The question was how we should go along from here. He saw value
                        in sending some US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> air squadrons on
                        training exercises, though we'd have problems here too. We should get
                        Commonwealth participation. Then we could put in the necessary radar and
                        communications. This arrangement could be superseded later, but in the
                        meantime it would deter Chinese Communists. After all we had deterred the
                        Chinese Communists from attacking Quemoy and Matsu for some time. So we
                        should both consider the air squadrons. TTK felt that the best way to
                        introduce them was a part of a training scheme. The President agreed,
                        indicating to do so would be quite helpful. It would also make clear to the
                        Chinese Communists our intention to help India if attacked.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked about the apparent US/Indian disagreement over the
                        size of the Indian force buildup. TTK said that they hadn't gotten very far
                        into this yet. He had explained the need for supersonic fighters and the US
                        had explained some of its difficulties, but this was where the matter
                        rested. On transport aircraft the C-119s might not be adequate, so perhaps a
                        squadron of C-130s was needed too. There was some discussion of when we
                        planned to withdraw the US squadron from India. The President was sure that
                        if needed we would keep the C-130s there. TTK then commented on the size of
                        the force Mountbatten had said India would need, i.e. 1,020,000 men in 17
                        divisions. India's own estimate was 1,019,000 men in 21 divisions, so there
                        was little difference. Anyway, it would be 18 months from now before the
                        Indians got to the problem of recruiting and equipping those divisions
                        beyond 16, so there was no need to decide this yet. He went on to say that
                        the third matter discussed had been defense production. India could not keep
                        importing ammunition. He understood a surplus ammunition plant was
                        available. Fourth, there was some difference over the proper Indian air
                        force strength. The Indians were considering whether they should add a new
                        Canberra squadron or one of heavy bombers. <persName>J.R.D. Tata</persName>
                        was here working on the problem.</p>
                    <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0629"/>
                    <p>The President asked what TTK thought of Pakistani fears that a change in the
                        “arms balance” would be a threat to Pakistan. TTK's response was that it all
                        depended on Indian intent. “We are not going to attack,” he said. “In fact,
                        we have moved all of our troops away from the Pakistan frontier.” He
                        mentioned inter alia that most of the cantonments for the Indian army were
                        normally in the Punjab, so their previous deployments were not really
                        against the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. TTK could not understand
                        why the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s would think India would ever
                        attack. In fact, a substantial group of Indian politicians favored a
                        settlement with Pakistan. India was much interested in the stability of East
                        Pakistan, which had a major bearing on Indian ability to meet an attack
                        through Burma. India wished <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> well
                        for this reason. It favored a “no war” declaration to resolve <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> fears. TTK told the President “you can
                        underwrite India's good behavior. We won't attack Pakistan.” But no Indian
                        leader could afford to make snap decisions on a Kashmir settlement.</p>
                    <p>The President asked how strong the group in India favoring settlement was.
                        TTK did not answer directly but said it was essential to have a politically
                        palatable settlement. One couldn't have 100,000 refugees coming down from
                        Kashmir and upsetting the 45 million Moslems in India, who were now
                        integrated into Indian body politic and happy with their role. At present,
                        India had gone as far as it could, but gradually people were coming to
                        realize that “Pakistan is a problem, not an enemy.” TTK said that he
                        personally would have advised <persName>Nehru</persName> to take <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE1">Black</persName> as a mediator in 1961.</p>
                    <p>TTK then commented that India had two problems. First, it must convince the
                        Southeast Asians that India couldn't be licked. This was important for their
                        morale. Second, it must seek a solution of Kashmir. But the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> couldn't tell the Kashmiris what to do.
                        They had autonomy in local affairs; the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>,
                        for example, couldn't instruct Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to let Sheikh Abdullah
                        out of jail. Let Pakistan create a similar autonomous state in its part of
                        Kashmir and then we could have free movement between the two areas and
                        develop other ties. Perhaps this way a settlement could be reached.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_GJK1"
                            >Galbraith</persName> he would rather have a plebiscite than give up the
                        Valley via a political decision.</p>
                    <p>The President dwelt on the problems which Kashmir dispute created with
                        Pakistan. If we could settle these it would be in India's interest as well
                        as ours. It would make it easier for us to be of help. We wanted to help in
                        any case but in ways causing the least trouble with the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. We should go ahead with radar, we should
                        keep the C-130s there if necessary. We would consider what we could do
                        toward providing equipment for 16 divisions and defense production aid. We
                        would also try to get the Commonwealth to come along on the air squadrons;
                        if they didn't it wouldn't in the last analysis deter us, but we would try
                        to get the Australians or someone in if the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> was reluctant.</p>
                    <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0630"/>
                    <p>TTK thought it was best for the US to keep in touch with the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s so they wouldn't go too far. India would
                        agree to mediation and would like to solve the Kashmir problem if only “to
                        avoid embarrassment to our friends.” He assured the President that Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> was completely sure of
                        “U.S. good will toward India.” The President said “maybe no satisfactory
                        solution can be reached on Kashmir but let's keep people on both sides
                        working.” He said the British thought that there was real danger of a <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> blowup. TTK responded that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> attitude had an historical basis. They had
                        “other interests” which affected their position. So the Indians hoped that
                        US help would not be completely tied to that of the Commonwealth. He said
                        the Canadians and Australians wanted to help India but they were small
                        countries. The President thought that Australia ought to do more. It was
                        only spending 3% of its <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> on defense. TTK
                        said that the British had yet other problems; “The Hong Kong lobby is a
                        strong one in the City of London.” The President replied that it was not
                        very strong here.</p>
                    <p>Commenting that the Indian Consortium prospects did not “look good,” the
                        President urged TTK on his trip to Western Europe to try to get more money
                        for the Consortium. The Germans ought to do more, the Canadians were not
                        doing enough, so the Indians should work harder on them. The President said
                        “India has a lot of friends; I am one of them. Let's be clear that we are
                        going to help India. We have a lot of problems, but we will go forward in
                        ways which will best deter the Chinese Communists.”</p>
                    <p>TTK stressed the possibility that if China attacked again, air might come
                        into play. The Indians would use air but this might bring an attack on
                        Indian cities. If India were unable to cope with this attack, it would have
                        a disastrous effect on Indian morale. TTK thanked the President for his
                        sympathy and understanding of Indian problems. As the visitors left, the
                        President again complimented TTK on his memorandum explaining the motives
                        behind the Chinese attack on India. He asked to keep it, saying that he
                        wanted to send it to various key Congressmen such as Mansfield and Fulbright
                        (TTK gladly agreed).</p>

                            for an agreement to end the transit dispute between Afghanistan and
                            Pakistan had improved as a result of Iranian mediation to the point of
                            agreement on Ministerial negotiations in Tehran. Pakistan was
                            represented by <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> in the
                            negotiations, which began on May 24. The Afghan representative was

                        sides have reached agreement on every substantial point. The only question
                        outstanding is the wording of the final communique which will spell out the
                        nature of the agreement that has been reached. As I understand the
                        situation, Pakistan has agreed to a complete resumption of normal relations
                        as they were before September 6, 1961, including the reopening of Afghan
                        offices in the former Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan. Pakistan
                        understandably wishes reassurance that the two sides can expect one another
                        to agree to refrain from actions against the maintenance of friendly
                        relations, and the Iranian Foreign Minister has proposed language
                        incorporating this thought for inclusion in the communique.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d301fn3">At issue, according to telegram 1035 from Tehran, was

                    <p>“May 29, 1963.</p>
                    <p>Dear Friend,</p>
                    <p>We had another long discussion in Cabinet yesterday about air defence of
                        India. The Cabinet were still worried about a military commitment to
                        defending India for the reasons which I explained in my message of May
                            15.<note n="1" xml:id="d303fn1">See <ref target="#d296">Document
                                296</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>However my colleagues were much relieved at the way in which you restated
                        your position in your message to me of May 23.<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2"
                            >The text of this message, in which <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> reported on his discussion with <persName

                            proceeding with the proposed U.S.-U.K. air defense program for India,

                            1962-63)</note> It was also very helpful to have the account which you
                        kindly sent about your Government's discussions in Washington with <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d303fn3"

                            instructions to convey a copy to the British Government. (Ibid., Central
                            Files, DEF 19-3 US-INDIA)</note> The Cabinet also had very much in mind
                        the importance of keeping in step with you on this great issue. They felt
                        that the position was much clearer than it had been and that we ought to be
                        able to get the advantages of the joint exercises with the Indians without
                        the dangers which we had foreseen.</p>
                    <p>I was able to persuade my colleagues that the plan which you put forward in
                        your message of May 23, for occasional visits to India by two fighter
                        squadrons, one American and one British, with the radar and ground equipment
                        provided by you, would serve a useful purpose without involving us in
                        dangerous commitments for the future. If such exercises can be planned with
                        some Indian participation, our visits could indeed be of real value not only
                        in familiarising our own squadrons with the terrain but also in increasing
                        India's air defence capacity.</p>
                    <p>Naturally such training arrangements with the Indians would not escape the
                        notice of the Chinese. But as you recognised in your last message I think
                        that this effect will result from the facts and need not be underlined by
                        any public statement. Equally Indian acceptance of and <pb n="608"
                            xml:id="pg_608" facs="0634"/>participation in these training exercises
                        would in itself indicate a significant and desirable shift in India's
                        traditional policy of non-alignment; but in the present state of Indian
                        opinion I do not think they would like this aspect to be too much
                        emphasised. We think therefore that it would be wise in any public statement
                        which we may ultimately have to make about joint air training exercises in
                        India not to give any indication of any more far-reaching purpose. I trust
                        that you will be able to agree to this method of presentation.</p>
                    <p>The Cabinet have authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to speak to <persName
                            corresp="#p_KTT1">Krishnamachari</persName> about air defence on the
                        basis that joint exercises by British and U.S. fighter squadrons might be
                        possible without any commitment to come to India's assistance in the event
                        of further Chinese attacks. They also agreed that we should now make
                        detailed plans with your staff for these periodical exercises in India.
                        Perhaps you would let us know what you think would be the most practical way
                        of making these detailed plans.</p>
                    <p>I am so glad that we seem to have found the right answer to this problem.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that our co-operation in this field can be very important for the
                        future.</p>

                        the types of assistance we hope to give India, that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_RS1">Radhakrishnan</persName> had commented on the needs of
                        India, and that the two had discussed the problem of Pakistan's relations
                        with India and the effect of those on the United States.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                            >Radhakrishnan</persName> advanced the thesis that China had attacked
                        India for both military and political reasons. Militarily, the Chinese
                        intention was to show that India was not strong enough to stand against
                        China, a lesson that would be observed in Southeast Asia as well. On the
                        political side, the Chinese probably thought they could disrupt the Indian
                        democratic way of life. If they could succeed, then other countries would
                        give up their struggles for democracy and go China's way. Also, the Chinese
                        might have believed that the impact would be felt on Australia, which is
                        sparsely populated while China is full. The thesis of empty lands and hungry
                        mouths could tempt China to move in the general direction of Australia. He
                        expressed the view that the democratic experiment will work only if there is
                        a strong grouping in Asia, taking Australia, Malaysia, and India together.
                        The stabilizing factor in Asia is the success of India's democracy, as it
                        was India's weakness that tempted the Chinese to come in. A basic point is
                        that the Himalayas have ceased to be a barrier, just as the Atlantic Ocean
                        ceased to be a protective barrier for the United States. In the Himalayan
                        region roads and other communications now make penetration much easier than
                        before. The Chinese could enter India again, and are prevented only by the
                        consciousness that India could get the strength to repulse the attack. India
                        has wanted to raise its eleven divisions to about 21 which in numbers of
                        troops comes to the same as Mountbatten's 17. He was sure that India has to
                        build up its strength, to give confidence to its own people and to its

                            >Radhakrishnan</persName> said that the Indian leaders had made a
                        special offer at the sixth and concluding round of ministerial talks on
                        Kashmir and related matters. These <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0636"
                        />included the offer of a no-war commitment, full disengagement of troops
                        from the India-Pakistan border, no freezing of the present Kashmir
                        situation, and continued effort to find a solution to the problems between
                        India and Pakistan. The Pakistanis did not accept this. On Kashmir, it
                        should be remembered that both the ruler and the National Front of Sheikh
                        Abdullah had wanted accession to India, so it was not correct to say that
                        the state had not been consulted. In addition, India has now spent crores of
                        rupees on development in the state.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked whether the
                        same factors that moved the Chinese last fall would cause them to attack
                        again or whether they had been largely satisfied by their successes in 1962.
                        In response Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Radhakrishnan</persName> observed
                        that the military weakness of India would continue to be a factor in the
                        situation until overcome.</p>
                    <p>He said that the Chinese had now turned back 3,900 prisoners to India of whom
                        ten had been brainwashed. Gurkhas were included in the returned
                        prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Gopal</persName>, explaining the situation on the ground, said
                        that India has sent its civil authorities right back to the McMahon Line.
                        The Assam Rifles are back from the line and the Army farther back. Since
                        September the Chinese have withdrawn from <gloss target="#t_NEFA1"
                            >NEFA</gloss> but elsewhere are holding 2,500 square miles more than
                        before, mainly in Ladakh.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> observed that we
                        desire our aid to help India both economically and militarily and that we
                        want a point short of causing a real crisis in Pakistan. Our aid, including
                        the presence of our forces, radar assistance, etc., are all factors China
                        will take into account. The program we have in mind would give the substance
                        of alignment without the fact of it. If India and the U.S. were to move on
                        this, the result should give India more security without heavy cost in terms
                        of our relations with Pakistan. We are as anxious as any country could be,
                        almost as anxious as India, that India should be prepared to defend itself,
                        and we are prepared to move in the direction of helping it.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> expressed the view
                        that Pakistan has always been interested in U.S. aid as a way of balancing
                        its power not against Russia or China, but against India. We have an
                        interest in Pakistan and in giving it assistance for several reasons,
                        including our ties with <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and some items of sensitive importance.
                        The Secretary added that it is possible to think that Pakistan looks on its
                        Chinese relations primarily as a factor of its relations with India.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked whether the U.S. had
                        had advance knowledge of the Pakistani decision to sign a border agreement
                        with Communist China. The Secretary responded that we had known something
                        about it ahead of time and had told the Indians. But he could not say there
                        was advance consultation in the usual way between allies. Mrs. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> observed that the Indonesian Foreign
                        Minister had said he had been told <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0637"
                        />by the Chinese Communists that their only interest in Ladakh was to keep
                        the U.S. from getting a base in the Gilgit region. Both the President and
                        the Secretary reassured her, should there be any possible doubt in her mind,
                        that the U.S. has no interest whatsoever in such an arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that the only check he could see against a fresh Chinese
                        attack was the prospect that it would spark a major conflict. This was the
                        effect of the prompt American aid given last fall and this explains the
                        importance of working out training programs for air defense now. The greater
                        the evidence of U.S. interest, it would seem the more restrained the Chinese
                        Communists will be. Then, in time, India could build its own defenses.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> asked what would be
                        the effect on India when the Chinese exploded a nuclear bomb. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RS1">Radhakrishnan</persName> said that until now India had
                        said it does not want to produce a nuclear bomb. He does not think India's
                        policy would change. However, Dr. <persName>Bhabha</persName> has said that
                        if India should want the bomb it could get it within twelve months. Of
                        course, if China should explode the bomb the general fear of China would
                        doubtless increase.</p>

                    <p>4364. After his return to New Delhi we know Ambassador plans to review his
                        visit to US with <persName>Nehru</persName>. We assume he will wish to
                        describe climate here regarding military assistance and the progress which
                        has been made during the visits of Bhoothalingam team, TTK, and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Radhakrishnan</persName>, details of which
                        already familiar to Ambassador. It would be desirable, however, to reflect
                        theme we have developed during these visits, i.e., we are determined to
                        assist India to build her defenses but we do have problems. In particular,
                        manner in which India handles its relations with Pakistan will have much to
                        do with extent, type, and pace our assistance.</p>

                    <p>We are somewhat concerned that members of <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                        of heat from US on Kashmir is off. Lack of movement on our mediation
                        proposal may also have created this impression within the <gloss

                        describing mood of Washington to make it clear we continue attach great
                        importance to resolution Kashmir problem and to getting mediation started;

                        between the 16-division force goal we are prepared to accept as reasonable
                        basis for judging Indian defense production priorities, and the lesser
                        number of divisions we are now supporting through end items. It might also
                        be useful to describe how appropriations process makes step by step
                        procedure in military assistance necessary.</p>
                    <p>As to dollar values, presentation should avoid dollar figures, and say that
                        full detail of actual items will be provided through <gloss
                            target="#t_USMSMI1">USMSMI</gloss>. If Indians ask what dollar values
                        are, you may give general orders of magnitude of actual <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> costs by project, and may also point out
                        that many items (radar, production line) in fact worth far more than costed
                        at. You should urge Indians not to think too much in dollar terms, and in
                        any case not to publicize dollar figures but rather substance of items. This
                        follows our normal practice in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> (Nassau
                        an exception we don't wish to repeat), and is well justified by reason of
                        security. You should also mention any release of figures, especially if
                        exaggerated, would complicate Pakistan problem and certainly not help

                    <p>Despite my parochial viewpoint, I see an increasingly strong case for
                        maintaining a small task force in the India Ocean. This perennial Navy
                        request has been pooh-poohed in the past largely because of fears that it
                        would grow like Topsy into a whole Indian Ocean fleet and involve expensive
                        new bases. But a less ambitious project might be quite useful, especially if
                        the Navy could settle for a protected anchorage or use of <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases.</p>
                    <p>It is simple fact that our greatest lack of conventional deterrent power lies
                        along the broad arc from Suez to Singapore. While our forces in the
                        Europe/Mediterranean and Far East areas might even be termed excessive, the
                        reverse is true in the area from the Red Sea to the Bay of Bengal, which
                        also happens to be the farthest away from the US (thus complicating our
                        problem of strategic lift). And we can't even fit our big carriers through
                        Suez.</p>
                    <p>We have traditionally left the defense of this region to the British, yet
                        their strength is waning at a time when we face a potential show of force or
                        actual combat needs ranging from Saudi Arabia to the Persian Gulf and Iran
                        through India and Burma to Malaysia. Mobile, sea-based, air power could be a
                        real asset to us here, e.g. in carrier demonstrations like the one we almost
                        ran in the Bay of Bengal during the Chinese attack last fall. It would also
                        minimize the need for expensive on-shore base rights, which would be
                        politically difficult to obtain.</p>
                    <p>What also makes an Indian Ocean force more feasible is that as we deploy
                        Polaris to Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, the need for substantial
                        carrier air is reduced. Given our substantial fixed investment in the
                        carriers, deploying a few of them to where we are weakest might make sense.
                        It would give quite a fillip to the <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"

                            <persName>Nehru</persName> and others at the least and lend more
                        credibility to our statements we could support them effectively if the need
                        arose.</p>
                    <p>In sum, if we want to beef up our capabilities in the Indian Ocean/Persian
                        Gulf/Red Sea area, a carrier force with conventional fire power <pb n="615"
                            xml:id="pg_615" facs="0641"/>(which I understand could reach far enough

                        flexibility by redeploying assets we've already got.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AA1">Ahmed</persName> made farewell call on
                        President July 9. <persName>Ahmed</persName> initiated conversation by
                        covering now familiar territory. He remarked <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618"
                            facs="0644"/>that situation on subcontinent gloomy verging on tragic.
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> acknowledged US was trying hard
                        resolve Kashmir problem and undoubtedly had given consideration to <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s view that military aid to India be
                        withheld until Kashmir and other issues settled. However, US, at time when
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat receding, had now
                        decided move beyond emergency aid and Nassau without taking into account
                        recalcitrance of India on Kashmir. Long term aid imperils <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> security and by not tying this aid to
                        resolution Kashmir, US had in effect written off Kashmir settlement.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ahmed</persName> observed that he is not clear how US views future
                        of subcontinent. US officials admitted security subcontinent depends on
                        rapprochement India and Pakistan. On other hand same officials have said we
                        cannot let Kashmir settlement determine our policies. In his view, he said,
                        US policy inconsistent. There can be no security without rapprochement; yet
                        rapprochement impossible without Kashmir settlement.</p>
                    <p>President commented that US has been taking <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> interests into account; we have very definitely not been
                        indifferent to <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> concerns. Our aid to
                        India was far less than India desired; we have not given India planes and
                        have instead arranged air defense exercises which will be much easier for
                        Pakistan. Also, we are deeply involved in trying help resolve Kashmir; this
                        effort is in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> interests. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> had practically worn
                        out his welcome in New Delhi by his pressure on Indians on Kashmir. Trouble
                        is that Pakistan and India still far apart on Kashmir and this compounds our
                        difficulties. Withholding aid to India, in our view, is not way to get
                        settlement; it would not work just as we realized year or more ago that this
                        type of pressure would not have caused Pakistan settle its problems with
                        Afghanistan. Contrary to what Ambassador said, US believes <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat, existing and potential, is
                        still great. Collapse of India is neither in US nor <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> interests. <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s must
                        be contained throughout Asia. Yet, the President continued, <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s display little appreciation of this
                        primary concern of ours and instead apparently feel impelled move towards
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s and away from us because
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> concern about India. In last few
                        months <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> press has exceeded all but <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> in its attacks against us. One would
                        gather from <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> press, which is closer to
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> than ours to <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                            >USG</gloss>, that US was enemy number one.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ahmed</persName> replied that US should not believe <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s are moving toward <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                        >GOP</gloss>, of course, wishes avoid antagonizing China, particularly with
                        hostile <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and India as neighbors, but
                        this not same as drawing closer to <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                        >Chicom</gloss>s. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>-<gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> border settlement was in US interest,
                        as well; <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s had defused potentially
                        dangerous situation. Air link with Communist China is purely commercial deal
                        forced on <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s by <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> denial of rights in Hong Kong. With respect <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> press, <persName>Ahmed</persName> remarked
                        that it is problem for <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> as well; US
                        should realize that attacks against US are, in fact, aimed as much at
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> who responsible for
                            <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0645"/>policy of close association
                        with West. When reading <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> press US must
                        realize Pakistan has suffered severe blows in recent months: arms aid to
                        India, failure of bilateral talks on Kashmir, and refusal of US and others
                        support Tarbela.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion President said he hoped that Ambassador in his new position
                        would bear in mind that US has one basic interest—prevention of control over
                        Europe by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or Asia by <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. Pakistan should understand this
                        outlook since it accepted responsibilities of alliance with us. We believe
                        alliance has been of real benefit to Pakistan, as it has been for us. We
                        value close alliance relationship. On our part, further military aid to
                        India will be given with clear eye to <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        interests. We realize <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s have bone deep
                        feeling about India. There are currently some divergencies in our immediate
                        interests; let us work hard together in reducing abrasive effects these
                            differences.<note n="1" xml:id="d308fn1">Printed from a copy that has no

                    <p>Since our military aid program to Pakistan is old hat now in India,
                        three-year program would appear, with probable exception of F-104's (as you
                        know <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s already have 12 F-104's), cause
                        relatively few problems. Three-year program would involve no greater
                        expenditures than would three one-year programs. Ambassador's recent

                        would, of course, create some problems. In present context Indo-US relations
                        these may relate more to prestige factor and domestic political
                        repercussions than any actual fear of Pakistan. Additionally, Indians would
                        probably consider we were guilty of reverse logic. In their view India has
                        immediate need for supersonics and we have refused; Pakistan has no urgent
                        problem, is in fact courting <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s
                        against whose threat we are supposedly allied, and yet we are giving
                        F-104's. Our answer to this argument would be that our alliance relationship
                        with Pakistan is still valid, and its purposes place certain requirements on
                        both Pakistan and the US which must be fulfilled in large interest of Free
                        World. However F-104's would not be scheduled for delivery before mid-1965.

                    <p>Much more interesting is WPB's idea of revealing privately to <gloss

                        than anything else. Chief problem is that program includes two squadrons of
                        F-5A's for 1965-68. If this leaked (as it would), it would fire Indian
                        desire for supersonics. But Indians will try to get supersonics anyway
                        sooner or later, if not from us then from Soviets. In fact, F-5's for <gloss

                        area against Communist encroachment. In principle, therefore, they welcome
                        the American initiative for exploratory discussions, as a first step, on the
                        understanding that these do not commit either Government in advance to any
                        particular course of action. In principle also Her Majesty's Government
                        agree that high level talks might usefully follow these exploratory
                        exchanges. However, in Her Majesty's Government's view these preliminary
                        discussions should take political and economic as well as purely strategic
                        considerations into account.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom therefore would be glad to
                        welcome in London United States representatives for preliminary discussions
                        with the aim of clearing our minds as to objectives, and in the light
                        thereof to produce agreed terms of reference for the United Kingdom/United
                        States Military Planning Group, which is already in existence and provides a
                        convenient forum. Her Majesty's Government would be glad to welcome
                        representatives of the American Government at any time but it would be
                        appreciated if a paper could be communicated in advance giving the
                        preliminary views and suggestions of the United States authorities.</p>

                    <p>474. Mediation Proposal. The problem of Kashmir and the timing of the
                        mediation proposal have been much on my mind since I arrived here, and as
                        Department is aware I have been endeavoring to get a more intimate feel for
                        this situation.</p>
                    <p>Prospect for mediation must be viewed in the light of current developments
                        which in terms of US-Indian relations are now highly colored by uncertainty
                        over <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> agreement, speculation on possible
                        effects of such a reversal on US support for Bokaro, and current <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat with possible <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> support which is now being highly
                        publicized in Delhi press. The atmosphere here is profoundly unsettled, to
                        put it mildly.</p>
                    <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0651"/>
                    <p>Before attempting to inject a mediation proposal into such an environment, we
                        should be clear with regard to our intentions and expectations. The hard
                        core question is this: do we seriously expect within a reasonable time to
                        bring India and Pakistan into meaningful negotiations to resolve their
                        difference over Kashmir, or are we simply playing out to its logical
                        conclusion a theme we initiated several months ago? Put another way, does
                        anyone believe that there are any predispositions on the part of the Indians
                        and Pakistanis to reach a settlement at this time, or indeed to do anything
                        more than attempt to secure a tactical advantage enabling one to embarrass
                        the other?</p>
                    <p>My conversations with Indians, with country team in New Delhi, and also with
                        my British colleague, plus my own assessment of the possible effectiveness
                        of a mediation proposal from us at this time, lead me to conclude that it
                        would be futile for us to proceed with this venture now. The following
                        factors are relevant: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><gloss target="#t_FonSec1">FonSec</gloss> told me informally on
                                26th that in his view any mediation proposal made in this highly
                                charged period would hinder the future prospects for a settlement of
                                the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> problem rather than help
                                them. Although <persName>Desai</persName> agreed on the value of
                                mediation per se, and stressed that the suggestion had originated
                                with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>, he pointed out relations
                                with Pakistan had sharply deteriorated since the original proposal
                                as a result of <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s
                                speeches hinting at Sino-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> mutual
                                defense agreement, and that many sober Indians were now seriously
                                persuaded <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s would join <gloss
                                    target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s should latter renew
                                aggressive action against India. In short,
                                    <persName>Desai</persName>, a reasonable man, was as adamant as
                                Gundevia on this question.</item>

                                        element of timing, and this is definitely not the moment.
                                        Indeed to <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0652"/>press

                            <item>We must also consider the likely effects of an unsuccessful
                                mediation effort at this time on US attitudes, especially
                                congressional, towards both India and Pakistan. A further
                                demonstration of the inability of these two countries to reach a
                                settlement would damage the image on both, and create even greater
                                difficulties for the Administration in implementing its aid
                                policies.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I realize that one argument for pressing the mediation proposal
                                now is the hope that this might dissuade the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                    >Pak</gloss>s from another effort to revive the fruitless
                                discussion of Kashmir in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                                However at best this only postpones the issue as far as the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s are concerned. It does not move
                                the problem closer to a solution.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Finally may I add that to place me at this stage in the position of whipping
                        a horse which although presently unconscious may be revived with sensitive
                        care is to decrease my effectiveness on other issues on which I may be able
                        to move our interest forward and to jeopardize whatever chance I may have to
                        produce a fresh approach to the Kashmir question at a later date.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I strongly urge the Department to resist pressures from the <gloss
                            target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on this subject and to table plans for
                        mediation until a more propitious moment, when it can be said that both
                        sides are to some extent predisposed seriously to discuss their
                            differences.<note n="1" xml:id="d313fn1"><persName corresp="#p_RD1"

                            Nonetheless, because Kashmir was the central issue affecting the

                    <p>[Here follows discussion relating to China, India, Korea, Vietnam, Ceylon,
                        and Sino-Soviet relations. The record of this discussion, except for the
                        brief reference to Ceylon, is printed in volume XXII, <ref target="#d181"

                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> about
                        the situation in Pakistan, noting that he had read the recent reports about
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> officials refusing to cooperate with
                        us in connection with our reconnaissance bases. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> said he was worried about the
                        situation and felt that it was very important for us to do something about
                        it promptly. So far our reconnaissance activity had not been halted, but
                        negotiations for a badly needed expansion of our base structure have been
                        stopped. He noted that criticism in Pakistan of the U.S. has been increasing
                        and he felt that some immediate action, such as sending a high-level
                        representative to talk to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> should be undertaken immediately.</p>
                    <p>The President responded by saying that we could not leave the Indians to face
                        the Chinese Communists alone, but that the result was a psychotic reaction
                        on the part of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s. He did not know
                        whether we should attribute the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> reaction
                        to any actions on our part. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                            >McCone</persName> commented that we got no credit for our efforts to
                        promote assistance to Pakistan by means of an international consortium.</p>
                    <p>The President suggested that we relate the things Mr. <persName

                        aspects of our policy toward Pakistan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"

                                corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> on non-existence of special
                                Sino-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> ties or understandings, we
                            wanted to make clear earnest US desire to avoid being forced to take
                            unpalatable choice between our wish to continue support <pb n="629"
                                xml:id="pg_629" facs="0655"/>Pakistan and our obligation to
                            discharge global responsibilities. I told the President he knew that
                            nothing could be allowed to prevent us from meeting our obligations to
                            the Free World as we saw them. The meeting of this commitment was in the
                            ultimate essential interest of Pakistan. During conversation I took
                            other opportunities to highlight our concern pointing out Pakistan's
                            immediate national interests should be in line with our broad policy. I
                            pointed out inevitable adverse reaction in US as was already happening
                            to some extent if it appeared Pakistan working with enemy of US and
                            serious view we must take of any actions Pakistan might be tempted to
                            take which would seek to limit our freedom to take action necessary for
                            global security. I also stressed our intention back up Indian resolve to
                            keep <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s and their influence out
                            of Indian territory, regardless of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                            views. This did not mean we necessarily endorsed Indian policies, but
                            that extension of Chinese influence over India would be an unacceptable
                            threat to all free interests including those of Pakistan.</item>

                            contained in message he asked me to convey to President that he too was
                            greatly concerned about current developments but he continued to be
                            convinced Pakistan needed US and that US needs and will need Pakistan
                            more and more as time goes on. He felt it would be a great misfortune if
                            we drifted apart through “force of circumstances.” He reaffirmed that
                            last thing Pakistan wanted was to get militarily or politically involved
                            with Communist China, “unless Pakistan is forced to the wall.”
                            Nevertheless, he elaborated and reiterated this thesis; <persName
                                corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> made clear there is risk of this

                            its security will be irretrievably undermined by continuing Indian
                            military build-up. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> urged we

                        suggests that he sees <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s trip as
                        showing nervousness on our part and may think his pressure tactics on us are
                        working. We'll have to disabuse him on this score, but his line to <persName
                            corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> shows how hard this will
                        be.</p>
                    <p>After letting us think it was all squared away, the Paks have started
                        stalling on our crucial Peshawar expansion. The intelligence people are all
                        worked up, and seem to favor a simple trade with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>—more supersonics (as part of 3-year <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> offer) for Peshawar acreage. State feels,
                        and I quite agree, that to succumb to such blackmail would be folly. Instead
                        we must get across to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that if he
                        doesn't play ball with us, our whole aid program will be at risk.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> inclines toward doubting that we
                        should offer anything to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s just now.
                        Let's wait and see instead how they come around under our pressure.
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> argues that we should
                        tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> flatly he can't hope to
                        defend himself against a much larger India, and that China can't supply him,
                        so that his only recourse is to us. But <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Averell</persName> thinks we should lend credibility to our assurances
                        by telling <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> we'll put some <pb

                        doing some joint planning with the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>Other issues are how hard to keep pushing Kashmir mediation, and how to
                        handle India if we offer the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s more
                        supersonics.</p>

                        of these tactics, he'll lose and so will we.</p>

                        authorities will react to this U.K.-U.S. joint proposal, but we cannot
                        understand how one can completely ignore the militant and aggressive
                        attitude of Pakistan and proceed to make proposals for a mediatory effort
                        for the consideration of the two Governments as if nothing had happened. Any
                        move for a mediatory effort of this kind must have essential pre-requisite
                        of a peaceful climate between the two countries. When there is absolutely no
                        desire of any kind on one side to consider a peaceful approach and there is
                        actual talk of war, a move like this towards peaceful processes cannot
                        succeed merely because it is based on a delicately balanced and carefully
                        drafted communique. As a matter of fact, hurried or forced move of this
                        sort, in total disregard of the prevailing atmosphere and without the
                        essential preliminary of preparation of the right climate between the two
                        countries, would make things worse.</p>
                    <p>We are quite clear that the Chinese are making a bid for leadership not only
                        in Asia but of the Communist world and this too only as a first step in
                        their bid for world leadership. Chinese hostility to the U.S.A. and to the
                        Western countries generally has been known for a long time and they have
                        been trying to isolate the U.S.A. while offering attractive trade terms to
                        other Western countries. The Chinese had hoped that the U.S.S.R. will play
                        their game and assist in Chinese internal consolidation and
                        industrialisation while at the same time containing the U.S.A. and Western
                        countries generally. This hope did not materialise and internal differences
                        which first arose in 1957 have now come out in the open. Though they have
                        assumed the form of ideological differences, it is obvious that fundamental
                        national interests are involved in these Sino-Soviet differences.</p>
                    <p>The latest Chinese campaign against the recent Test Ban Treaty is yet another
                        illustration of their grand design. They detest any accommodation or
                        understanding between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. or any easing of
                        international tensions which comes in the way of their Asian and global
                        ambition.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese want people in Afro-Asian and Latin American countries to adopt
                        militant, aggressive and revolutionary attitudes and are against democratic
                        evolutionary processes under stable regimes. They have been exploiting local
                        quarrels between the countries in various regions all over the world to
                        maintain an atmosphere of tension and conflict. In Asia, which is their
                        first target and where India is the chief obstacle, they are playing very
                        heavily with Pakistan against India and also playing to the extent possible
                        with Indonesia against the other countries in South East Asia.</p>
                    <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0660"/>
                    <p>So far as India is concerned, the Chinese aim is not acquisition of territory
                        in the border dispute. The border dispute raised by China formally for the
                        first time towards the end of 1959 has come in as a handy excuse, but the
                        real aim is to force on India a political settlement which will involve
                        India re-orienting its policies to suit the pattern of Chinese global
                        policies. Failing this, China would like to put all possible pressures on
                        the Indian Government and cause internal disintegration as China regards
                        India as the main obstacle in its plans of domination over Asia, because its
                        democratic patterns of internal policy and its friendly and peaceful
                        external policy have been accepted and welcomed by most of the countries of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>In the context of the Chinese global and local aims and the Chinese pressure
                        on our borders, the joint mediatory move, in the current climate of
                        Indo-Pakistan relations, will actually hinder our defence efforts against
                        the Chinese threat. We have to devote all our energies to building up an
                        adequate defence potential so that we do not have to negotiate with them
                        from weakness or to submit to a political settlement of their dictation. We
                        have, at the same time, to see that our development plans go ahead and we do
                        not lose by back door what we are trying to save by protecting the front
                        door. Your Government have been helping us in both these tasks handsomely
                        and generously, but there is a great deal more to be done yet. Above all
                        care has to be taken to see that the people in India who are making a
                        monumental effort to meet the crisis they are facing are not discouraged or
                        disheartened in any way. The draft joint communique of the type given to us
                        for consideration by Ambassador Chester Bowles and High Commissioner Sir
                            <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Paul Gore-Booth</persName> is not only not
                        practical politics in the context of Pakistan's current attitudes, but would
                        only result in irritating the people in India and in dampening their ardour
                        and keenness to face the Chinese threat.</p>
                    <p>As I have said repeatedly, we want friendly and cooperative relations with
                        Pakistan and we would like to do whatever we can to reach this objective by
                        exploring all possible avenues of settling our differences with Pakistan in
                        a peaceful manner. Last May when Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> was here, we also suggested the
                        quiet good offices of an eminent person acceptable to both parties to help
                        in resolving all our differences. Since then much has happened and Pakistan
                        is now practically lined up with China. Mere pushing ahead of institutional
                        arrangements for a mediatory effort, regardless of the current climate, is
                        no solution and might even make the situation worse. The necessary
                        preparatory work by quiet diplomacy to get the appropriate atmosphere has to
                        be put in first. We have, therefore, to face facts and wait and work for a
                        better climate.</p>

                    <p>Meeting with the President on Pakistan</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> described his mission
                        as being to tell <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> where we are
                        going and to find out where he is going. The core of the problem is <pb
                            n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0662"/>that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> can't defend himself against India so has to rely on
                        us. Our problem is to reassure him that our commitment to defend him is
                        credible. The question is what we can do to make our assurances more
                        credible. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested we might
                        talk about a possible Indian Ocean carrier task force, joint exercises,
                        extending planned airlift demonstrations through Turkey to Pakistan, etc. He
                        wasn't talking of joint planning—this would create real problems with
                        India—but of things we could do short of this. We had given <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> materiel; what was lacking was
                        evidence we would back him if attacked.</p>
                    <p>Bill Bundy explained some of the complications involved, e.g. it took three
                        carriers to keep one on station. There was also the problem of where to base
                        them in the area. Joint exercises might be feasible, and we had earlier
                        offered one to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. It might also be
                        possible to demonstrate our airlift capability, though probably with a
                        smaller unit than we were planning to send to Turkey. The President said we
                        should “talk with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>“ before
                        mentioning any carrier task force; otherwise we might upset our present
                        carrier plans. At this point we should just talk about how fast we could get
                        carriers there if necessary. Bill Bundy felt that best gambit would be joint
                        exercises against the contingency of an attack through Afghanistan, which
                        would implicitly show the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s how we could
                        support them against India too. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                        felt planning against Afghanistan was hardly a good noise, just at the time
                        when things were going our way, and the Afghan King was coming here.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> interposed that what
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> really wants is less
                        reassurances against Indian attack than that we will not help India
                        militarily.</p>
                    <p>At the President's request, Bill Bundy explained what military aid we were
                        currently giving India and planning over the next two years. The various
                        tranches added up to $75-100 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1964, depending of course on the appropriations outcome. On the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> side we had made a big delivery push this
                        year, amounting to about $58 million. In fact we delivered more firepower to
                        Pakistan than to India. Over the next few years our military aid ought to
                        balance out at about 2-1 in favor of India over Pakistan. The President
                        wondered what <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> could say about
                        comparative aid to India and Pakistan; <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> wouldn't like a 2-1 ratio.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> thought the real problem was
                        that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> wants to take care of the
                        Indian threat himself. We have got to convince him he can't but must depend
                        on us. This is why credible assurances are necessary. In fact, the Indians
                        are now fearful that the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s will attack
                        them, so India wants reassurances too. Thus the nub of the problem is how to
                        convince <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> we mean what we say. If
                        we demand that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> stop his
                        flirtation with China, we must give him confidence we will protect him. The
                        President queried whether <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was
                        really trying to use us to solve Kashmir. What could <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> say to him that would be helpful?
                            <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s answer was to tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> he couldn't get along
                        without us. While we can't go to <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0663"
                        />joint planning against India, we can give credible evidence of our ability
                        to support Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> said that <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s job was not just to reassure
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> against Indian aggression
                        but to stress our primary interest in the threat to the north, which
                        demanded <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>/Indian reconciliation if it was
                        to be met effectively. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        thought it would be difficult to keep <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> off the track of worrying about India.</p>
                    <p>The President doubted that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was
                        worried militarily about the Indians. He wanted to use us against the
                        Indians on Kashmir and we couldn't give this to him. So what could we offer
                        him? There wasn't much for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to
                        say except to repeat our position. We weren't getting much from the
                        Pakistani either. About all the alliance was worth to us was the
                        intelligence facilities. He asked about the apparent slow-down in
                        negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> explained that
                        since 15 June the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s had been stalling on
                        the final agreement for Peshawar expansion, amid growing criticism of the
                        US. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> feared that the next
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> move would be to cut back on
                        existing facilities which he stressed were far more important than the
                        expansion. In response to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                        question, he saw no alternative option elsewhere to expansion of Peshawar.
                        It gave us a 30% increase in efficiency, much better coverage of China, and
                        a more flexible arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The President reverted to what <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        could say that would convince <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied we could warn him
                        about coming trouble on the Hill, citing the Broomfield Amendment which
                        almost passed. McGeorge Bundy felt that simply to say “disagreeable words”
                        was worth the effort. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                        adverted to the thought that the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s were
                        genuinely worried about an Indian attack, so we should study how we could
                        reassure them. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> proposed the
                        tactic of asking <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> some direct
                        questions. For example, did he want US military aid to continue? Did he want
                        US support in event of an Indian attack? We should try and put the monkey on
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s back. <persName
                            corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> added that what <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> didn't say would be just as important
                        as what he did. The <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s were mounting a
                        pressure campaign on us, and to the extent that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> did not respond by promising them additional aid, it
                        would be a warning that such tactics wouldn't work.</p>
                    <p>The President seemed unsatisfied by these rejoinders and again asked “what
                        precisely do we want to get from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                        >Ayub</persName>.” We know each other's arguments, so the best we can do is
                        remind them we don't like the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s,
                        get them to call off their distasteful press campaign, and tell them that
                        Peshawar is vital to us so that if they don't play ball, we will give our
                        aid to someone else. The President said he understood <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s arguments and could see his point of
                        view. As seen by the Pakistani, India was a threat to their interests.
                        However, we were right too in our position, so the best we could get was a
                        “standoff.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> rejoined that the
                            <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0664"/><gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s needed us more than we needed them. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> would pull back from his China gambit
                        if we pressed him hard enough.</p>
                    <p>The President still didn't think that <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> was really scared of India. What would the Indians get
                        out of attacking Pakistan? They'd lose a billion dollars in Western aid.
                        What <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was really worried about
                        was that he was losing the capability to attack India successfully or at
                        least to get his way vis-a-vis India. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> interjected that the Pakistani must know we could
                        pulverize India with nuclear weapons. The President simply doubted that we
                        could or would use nuclear weapons except if forced to against the Soviets.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out that this illustrated the value
                        of an Indian Ocean task force with conventional capabilities. This would
                        give us a little cushion out in the area. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> indicated he was dubious about any cut-back in our
                        carrier force. For just this sort of reason he would want to take a close
                        look at any such proposals. The President said he'd asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about an Indian Ocean
                        squadron.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> felt the real point was for
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to make clear that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s “gamesmanship” is now getting out of
                        bounds. But the President asked why we were so worried about how far
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> went with China? He couldn't
                        be really serious about this. Bill Bundy indicated that while we wouldn't
                        really be ready to talk about carriers for awhile, we could give <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> some dope about how fast we could get
                        out there if he were attacked. We could describe, for example, what we could
                        do with the CASF. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would provide some
                        ammunition to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In response to the President's query as to whether <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would say anything about <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>, especially F-104s, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> replied it was preferable to hold off any such
                        discussions and make his mission a strictly political exercise. There was
                        some discussion about giving supersonics to Pakistan and India. Bill Bundy
                        pointed out we have to face this issue in the next <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> program in any case, because the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s expected modernization of their air force. It was pointed
                        out that the Soviets might give supersonics to India. The President's view
                        was “Let's not give supersonics to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s
                        if we don't to the Indians or vice versa.” This led the President to ask
                        again what <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> realistically
                        expected to achieve. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> answered
                        that we would at least clarify to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> our views on his China gambit. The President asked how
                        we would respond if he countered that the Indians were playing with the
                        Russians. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt we could argue
                        this was different—we have an alliance with the Paks and not with the
                        Indians.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> raised the question of what
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> might say on Kashmir.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt we should not
                        “disengage” on this issue, partly because of the repercussions on the Hill.
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recalled that the Indians had
                        agreed to mediation, but <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName>
                        pointed out they had recently changed their tune. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> wondered whether the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s were really much interested <pb n="639"
                            xml:id="pg_639" facs="0665"/>in mediation at this point. If the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s raised the issue in the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we could use the President's new policy of
                        “abstention.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> asked about press treatment.
                        When news of the trip got out he favored as neutral a press guidance as
                        possible. We should simply say that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> was going out at the President's request to discuss
                        US/Pakistani relations. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed
                        that neutral treatment was best, although both the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s and Indians were going to speculate widely on his
                        purpose.</p>

                            the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. In the speech,

                            talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. He attributed the failure of
                            the talks to Pakistan's determination to achieve a settlement entirely
                            upon its own terms, or to continue the existing deadlock over the issue.

                            equitable settlement to the dispute, but he concluded that the terms of
                            reference proposed by Pakistan for the mediation exercise made success
                            impossible. (Department of State, Central Files, <gloss target="#t_pol1"

                        took us by surprise. Though I can understand your irritation with Pakistani

                    <p>You know that we are determined to assist India to the fullest in building a
                        free society, a task now rendered more difficult by an obvious external
                        threat. To this end, we have sought to provide India with far more
                        assistance than any other single aid recipient. I might add that I
                        personally intervened with the Germans, Japanese, Italians, and British to
                        get this year's consortium contributions up to the level finally achieved.
                        But the setback to mediation will inevitably have an adverse impact on our
                        efforts to obtain Congressional and popular support for economic and
                        military aid to India and Pakistan. I must tell you quite frankly that it is
                        hard to counter the mounting resistance in the Congress against aid programs
                        which seem destined to aggravate disputes between two nations, both of which
                        we regard as friends. This is not anti-Indian sentiment; it is a ‘plague on
                        both your houses' attitude.</p>
                    <p>The only way we see to counter this resistance, recognizing that Kashmir and
                        other issues are not susceptible of easy and quick solutions, is to
                        demonstrate that sincere and determined efforts are nevertheless underway to
                        solve them. Here is where we had counted heavily on the mediation effort you
                        proposed.</p>
                    <p>We entirely share your appreciation of Chinese aims vis-a-vis India. We too
                        are also concerned at Pakistan's developing relationship with Communist
                        China, and intend to do what we can to arrest this trend. But we regard it
                        as even more in India's interest than in ours to forestall a Pakistan-China
                        accommodation. However emotionally the Pakistani are behaving, and whatever
                        the temptation to reply, surely a further heating up of the atmosphere
                        between your two countries aggravates rather than diminishes this risk. We
                        do not see a mediatory effort as weakening you against China, but as a move
                        to lessen pressure on your flank, and hopefully to lead toward a
                        reconciliation which will greatly strengthen India's position.</p>
                    <p>In the last analysis, it must be primarily the task of Indian statesmanship,
                        in seeking to strengthen India against Chinese Communist pressure, to
                        forestall aggravation of this threat via closer Pakistani-Chinese ties. We
                        want to help, but to do so effectively we must know more clearly what you
                        propose to do. As I see it, you do not rule out mediation but suggest the
                        necessary preparatory work be done by quiet diplomacy. An atmosphere must be
                        created, but how is this to be done? We wonder what steps you plan to
                        reestablish communications. Once we know what course you contemplate, we
                        will do what we can to help bring Pakistan to the mediation table, which we
                        still believe is the course best calculated to serve your larger interests
                        and to permit us most effectively to help.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>In connection with the discussion at the White House last Monday, concerning
                        measures that might be taken to convince Pakistan of our capacity to respond
                        effectively to an Indian attack (or vice versa if the case should ever
                        arise), the State Department has particularly raised the question of
                        possible deployment of a carrier task force to the Indian Ocean, either as a
                        temporary measure or eventually as a permanent deployment.</p>
                    <p>I therefore request that the Joint Chiefs of Staff review this question,
                        comparing the feasibility, effectiveness, and comparative costs of
                        deployment of a carrier versus alternative methods of bringing U.S. power to
                        bear in the area. This question may be considered as part of your response
                        to the generalized request for courses of action that would serve to
                        convince Pakistan of our capacity to respond, or you may if desired wish to
                        take it up in a broader framework.<note n="1" xml:id="d320fn1">In a

                                            immediately be brought to bear in Karachi. Since it
                                            would take three or four months to select a mediator and

                    <p>Impressed that while all of this was helpful an additional move by <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was now urgently required which, taken in
                        present context, might enable US persuade <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s to adopt equally moderate approach which in turn could
                        lead to beginning of mediation process.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s response both to President's
                        letter and to my presentation was moderate.</p>
                    <p>He first emphasized his understanding of difficulties Pres <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> faced in Congress and also in
                        dealing with Pakistan. He added he was grateful not only for substantial aid
                        American <gloss target="#t_govt1">Govt</gloss> had given India, but for way
                        in which Pres <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, ever since he
                        first sat in Senate, had personally <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0670"
                        />supported India's efforts and had demonstrated an understanding of India's
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>However as I myself had recognized he was now faced with an extremely serious
                        political predicament. As I could see balance of political forces within
                        India had changed radically in the ten years since last served here.
                        Opposition now calling for his downfall was mostly group which could not
                        agree on anything. Nevertheless its ill disguised appeals to communal
                        emotions were dividing country while its irresponsible attacks were
                        threatening tax and other programs which are essential to growth of Indian
                        economy and to military security vis-à-vis China.</p>
                    <p>C. <persName>Nehru</persName> said there was no question of closing the door
                        in regard to Kashmir. Indeed, regardless of what <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s might say or do, door would remain open for discussions
                        when there was reasonable hope for sober conversations and possible
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>Even taking into account difficulties we faced at home and in Karachi, he
                        questioned that this was an opportune time for mediation. Again he wished
                        make clear this did not mean he was turning his back on mediation concept.
                        As he said in May he thought mediation would be most hopeful way to approach
                        issue which had divided India and Pakistan for so many years.</p>
                    <p>However, if he were now to appear to be bowing to US-<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> pressure (and everyone knew that he was under such pressure)
                        he was fearful of reaction from irresponsible opposition group which was
                        ready to seize on any sign of Congress Party weakness.</p>
                    <p>I said it was not question of one-sided US-British pressures. Our <gloss
                            target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss> in Karachi was pressing hard on <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s and as I had pointed out we were now
                        considering additional pressure in near future. Fact of matter was that we
                        are deeply and genuinely worried and if this were not the case present
                        conversation would not be taking place. In my opinion I said, time is
                        running out. Would he therefore agree to make further moderate statements in
                        Lok Sabha and to assure US privately, that provided angry comments could be
                        prevented in Karachi, he was prepared—say at close of Lok Sabha session—to
                        proceed seriously to negotiate basis for meaningful mediation arrangement?
                        We are already striving against great difficulties to keep situation quiet
                        in Karachi and this would give us something tangible to go on.</p>
                    <p>Although <persName>Nehru</persName> did not respond directly, he looked
                        thoughtful and after few moments said he would reply to President; in
                        meantime would carefully consider what I had said. I asked when we might
                        expect some word. He replied he was now urgently concerned with organization
                        of government's case for debate early next week on no-confidence motion,
                        first he had faced in his long years as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                            >PriMin</gloss>. He would be in touch with us as soon as he had chance
                        further to consider this complex problem coming at inopportune time.</p>

                    <p>Comment: Since previous two meetings there has been striking change in <gloss
                            target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s appearance and attitude.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> looked and acted much as he did ten years
                        ago. His face was expressive, he was full of bounce and had much of his old
                        charm and humor. <persName corresp="#p_GBSPH1">Gore-Booth</persName>
                        commented to me on same phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly explanation lies in fact that during last few days he has been
                        doing what he most enjoys—debating, planning, and maneuvering for high
                        political stakes within Indian political system—much as he may complain
                        about it.</p>
                    <p>Although we face uphill struggle I see glimmer of hope that with restraint in
                        Karachi as well as Delhi we may conceivably get mediation operation under
                        way. From point of view here best development for next two or three weeks
                        would be benevolent silence in Rawalpindi. If <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s refuse to go ahead we will of course face a new impasse.
                        If they suddenly rush to embrace US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        proposal <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will feel it is being
                        deliberately embarrassed and even if <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s go
                        along mood may not be constructive.</p>
                    <p>We must be realistic about mediation effort itself. Its most immediate
                        contribution in India will be to paper over our own present difficulties
                        with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> bill, <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                            >VOA</gloss>, Bokaro, etc. Beyond this expedient result, it will serve
                        to moderate divisive and embittered actions in both countries thereby
                        reducing tensions. The major hope would be that it would create some modus
                        vivendi acceptable to both countries which over a period of years could
                        gradually evolve into a permanent solution.</p>

                        will agree that achievement of our objectives on subcontinent as a whole
                        requires us take very hard look at full range of actions which might be of
                        use in straightening out our relations with Pakistan. As we proceed with
                        this examination we shall, of course, be alive to Indian reactions.</p>
                    <p>As you aware, we are considerably disturbed over current state US-<gloss

                            or as part of three-year package. By putting proposal into three-year
                            framework, we can postpone delivery dates, with deliveries beginning in
                            July, 1965, in increments of six every six months. Initial delivery date
                            gives us time to look at Indian needs. Our present thinking is along
                            these lines. We continue to believe that the installation of radar, the
                            training of Indian technicians, and improved Indian performance in the
                            handling of their present fighter inventory should come first. When
                            these things have been accomplished, the US believes India should be
                            able to obtain a limited number of such aircraft, probably in the
                            mid-1965 time frame from Free World sources. This would leave open the
                            question whether the supply of advanced aircraft should be by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or the US. These thoughts have not yet
                            been conveyed to the Indians nor should they be at this time.</item>

                        <item>The F-104 A/B, although superficially glamorous because of its Mach 2
                            speed, is in fact purely day fighter-interceptor with very limited
                            bomb-carrying capacity; its range is so short that without effective
                            intercept control (which <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s do not
                            have) it has only limited intercept capability and considerably lesser
                            capability to bomb Indian bases effectively. <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                    <p>Three-year proposed program is, as noted, based on prior commitments and
                        valid military requirements. It is substantially same as we planned to do in
                        three one-year installments, and about $18 million less than sum of previous
                        three years. Our commitment to it would have two key goals: (1) reassurance
                        of continuing US support at key psychological moment in terms <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> policy examinations, and move towards
                        elimination <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> stalling many areas of
                        importance to US; and (2) hopefully getting us off hook on prior commitment
                        which we are unable to fulfill—replacement of obsolete destroyers. In short,
                        the three-year package would not be major new undertaking with Pakistan but
                        rather minimum acceptable continuing program. Further, it would not be
                        unprecedented in area, for we have five-year commitment with Iran completed
                        last September, and <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s almost certainly
                        know of this in view close <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>/Iran military
                        ties. Also, since we must announce our plans now for the F-104 A/Bs, even
                        though we do not plan delivery until mid-1965, our <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> programs for the next three years (<gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1964-65-66) are, in poker parlance, clearly an ace, a ten
                        and a five. If we play the ace, <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0674"
                        />without simultaneously playing our other two cards, we (1) lessen the
                        initial impact and (2) are left holding a poor hand in <gloss

                        1966. Consequently, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> as a political tool
                        can best be used now.</p>
                    <p>The long and short of it is that, while we recognize our opportunities in
                        India, we must also be mindful of our interests in Pakistan. We have
                        responded in India's time of need and are continuing to do so. The Indian
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program receives greater attention,
                        and her needs get a higher priority, than any other <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> recipient in the world, with the possible exception of
                        Vietnam. Since the Chinese attack the US alone has already given, or is
                        planning to give $110 million in military aid, not to mention, as you so
                        rightly point out, our past economic assistance, for which we have not
                        sought the very tangible quo's that we do elsewhere, particularly in
                        Pakistan. We feel that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can be
                        persuaded of necessity for our meeting our commitments to Pakistan in
                        continuation of existing programs in interests of stable Pakistan oriented
                        to Free World. Although we are committed to integrated, subcontinental
                        approach to our problems and opportunities in South Asia there is presently
                        serious danger of an imbalance which could undermine our position on
                        subcontinent. Surely, Government of India does not expect it is in our or
                        India's interest that as we assist India we divorce ourselves from
                            Pakistan.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">In telegram 771 from New Delhi,

                            text of an aide-mémoire of that date, which constituted the Pakistani
                            reply to the proposed joint communiqué presented to <persName

                                >footnote 2, Document 317</ref>). The aide-mémoire noted that the
                            mediation proposal contained in the joint communiqué took little account
                            of the specific terms of reference stipulated by Pakistan as essential
                            to a successful mediation effort (see <ref target="#d298fn2">footnote 2,
                                Document 298</ref>). Pakistan insisted that the mediator's terms of
                            reference be agreed in advance, and that the scope of the mediation be
                            confined to the Kashmir dispute. The conclusion drawn in the
                            aide-mémoire was that, in light of the attitude of the Indian Government
                            as reflected in the statement by <persName>Nehru</persName> in the Lok
                            Sabha on August 13, any mediation effort would inevitably fail.

                            He had expressly approved document as now delivered.</item>

                        <item>After quick perusal of aide-mémoire I said I would of course not voice
                            definitive <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> reaction at that moment.
                            However, as interim reaction, I could not refrain from voicing US
                            disappointment that aide-mémoire did not move in direction of definite
                            agreement to mediation proposal. I did not construe it as flat
                            rejection, but the various non-concurring positions taken by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would necessarily lead to further
                            negotiation and possible complications. I said that at outset I must

                            of concessions asked for on May 21 by Foreign Minister, with one partial
                            exception, had been accepted by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. I
                            noted that we had made a major effort to accommodate the essence of the
                                <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> views, not only on duration of
                            the mediator's mandate, but also on mention of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, identification of Kashmir as the
                            principal issue to be dealt with by mediator, and scope of the terms of
                            reference. We felt that our proposed text met the basic requirements of
                            the 30, and indeed went so far we would have difficulty in inducing the
                            Indian <gloss target="#t_govt1">Govt</gloss> to agree. We doubted if
                            there would be any hope whatever of winning Indian acceptance of any
                            language which went farther to meet Pakistani desires. I expressed the
                            hope the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would look to the practical
                            significance rather than the verbal dressing of <pb n="650"

                        <item>Foreign Secretary said <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> view was
                            that terms of our proposed joint communique were “far too imprecise.” It
                            was necessary for mediator's terms to be nailed down very explicitly.
                            This might require an agreement of some sort, rather than just a joint
                            communique. In absence of well-defined terms of reference, there would
                            be ambiguity, uncertainty and unpredictability. Indians would put many
                            pressures on mediator to get off the main Kashmir track and to make
                            recommendations on matters which would not have any direct bearing on
                            settlement of Kashmir. If framework within which mediator would operate
                            not firmly established, his work would be delayed and he might come up
                            with irrelevant recommendations or judgments, which would be
                            embarrassing for Pakistan.</item>

                        <item>Foreign Secretary dwelt emphatically on imperative need for evidence
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is now receptive to an

                            of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> people again, only to dash their
                            hopes. Government would be subject to heavy criticism for leading people
                            down illusory path once more and govt would be dangerously vulnerable to
                            the assaults of the opposition. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> saw
                            no shred of evidence of any disposition on part of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to give an inch on Kashmir. In fact
                            attitude of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had conspicuously
                            hardened in recent weeks as evidenced by tone of

                            withdrawal of imaginary “concessions.” Assessment of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> is that deliberate action of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in arousing people of India against
                            Pakistan and against the idea of conciliation on Kashmir constitutes
                            positive proof that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had no intention
                            of budging at all. Obviously <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                            have to prepare public opinion well in advance for concessions on
                            Kashmir and record of <gloss target="#t_govt1">govt</gloss> in doing
                            just the opposite amply verifies the absence of any intention to seek an

                            Kashmir.</item>

                        <item>As to limitation of mediation effort to Kashmir, Foreign Secretary
                            thought that inclusion of “other related matters,” would open up
                            arguments, and make it difficult for the mediator to concentrate on the
                            business at hand which was Kashmir, and only Kashmir. He argued that
                            traditionally in diplomatic history the assignment of a mediator has
                            been to one and only one carefully defined dispute. He saw no reason for
                            departing from this tradition. <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was
                            convinced that vague general directive, with the extent of mediator's
                            brief not sharply delineated would not work. He was aware that “Kashmir
                            and other related matters” was the language of the agreed announcement
                            of November 29, 1962. But he argued that this broadening out of scope
                            was more appropriate for direct bilateral discussions between
                            representatives of the two <gloss target="#t_govt1">Govt</gloss>s than
                            it would be for a mediator. <gloss target="#t_govt1">Govt</gloss>
                            representatives had to be prepared to take cognizance of various issues
                            involving their country. But this was not the case with a mediator who
                            did not represent either country. It was not practicable or appropriate
                            for him to deal with anything more than the specific international
                            dispute which brought his role into being.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Amplifying my preliminary reaction, I pointed out clear necessity for
                            constructive move of some sort on Kashmir since <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                >GOP</gloss> felt it could not permit issue to remain static. We
                            were trying to help Pakistan to overcome the existing inertia on the
                            question and there was obligation on <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            to help us in our effort to help them. Mediation effort was only
                            constructive move we could see on the horizon. I invited him to name any
                            alternative procedure which held promise. This he did not do.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>I said of course we could not make any finding that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was now likely to agree to a Kashmir
                            settlement which would be acceptable to Pakistan. No one would have
                            temerity to make such official prediction. If India would agree to our
                            draft formulation, this was the most we could hope for before the
                            mediator started his work. No one could say what might come out of the
                            mediation. It was our hope that the mediator's work as he progressed
                            would enable him to shape up his own terms of reference and perhaps open
                            up hopeful settlement possibilities not foreseeable at the outset. A
                            good mediator would carve out his own role for himself and he might be
                            able to bring about a solution which would constitute a near miracle. At
                            least the effort needed to be made. My <gloss target="#t_govt1"
                                >govt</gloss> did not think the risks involved in failure of a good
                            effort were as great as <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0678"
                            />portrayed by the Foreign Secretary. Even if the risks were
                            appreciable, the dangers of hopeless inaction seemed greater.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>I noted that traditionally “the war is on” the more violent forms of
                            propaganda by tacit agreement between Pakistan and India during the
                            course of a Kashmir settlement effort. The worst invective and diatribe
                            are “out” for the duration of the negotiation and this in itself is a
                            considerable, albeit temporary gain, at least in a negative
                            sense.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>I further urged that even if the mediator's efforts should unhappily
                            prove to be stillborn, his recommendations would be almost bound to have
                            some nourishment in them for the Pakistan point of view, and Pakistan
                            would not lose by keeping unsullied its record of cooperation and
                            compliance with all responsible international moves looking to a Kashmir
                            solution.</item>

                        <item>As to the Foreign Secretary's argument that every abortive effort on
                            Kashmir resulted in a serious political setback in Pakistan, I noted
                            that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                            himself had just set forth in a speech before the National Assembly that
                            there were modest but important gains for Pakistan growing out of the
                            ill-fated six rounds of ministerial level meetings on Kashmir from
                            December to May. The Foreign Secretary had no effective rejoinder to
                            this and he smilingly said the Foreign Minister had to make this speech
                            for internal political purposes, pretending there were gains in order to
                            protect himself from opposition attacks.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>I told the Foreign Secretary that the attitude of India on Kashmir and
                            on <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations in general remained one
                            of various factors we were taking into account in determining the nature
                            and pace of our defense assistance program. It was a complicated
                            equation and of course our evaluation of the Chinese Communist threat
                            had to be the largest single factor. But Indian policy toward Pakistan
                            was not outside our area of consideration. The Foreign Secretary said he
                            knew this factor had not been entirely ignored but his <gloss
                                target="#t_govt1">govt</gloss> was eager to see it given much
                            greater weight and to be told more about it. He conceded we could not
                            disregard the dimensions or the imminence of the Chinese Communist
                            military threat on India's northern borders.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>The Foreign Secretary ended by saying that his <gloss
                                target="#t_govt1">govt</gloss> had made an earnest search for some
                            additional initiative which would assist us in our search for a useful
                            approach to the Kashmir problem. The <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            did not want to add to US burdens. Accordingly the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> was now suggesting that the US might
                            wish to consider the possibility of informally dispatching an acceptable
                            prospective mediator for preliminary and exploratory personal
                            conversations in Rawalpindi and Delhi as to the outlook for a successful
                            mediation effort. The nature of the visit would not be divulged. The
                            visitor would be as close to incognito as possible claiming merely a
                            tourist status if questioned. The Foreign Secretary granted my point
                            that this status would be exceptionally difficult to maintain, since the
                            individual would be an outstanding personage. Foreign Secretary said
                            that if the designee made a finding that the prospects <pb n="653"
                                xml:id="pg_653" facs="0679"/>for mediation were favorable, “we could
                            proceed from there.” I said that I would prefer not to express any
                            reaction to this final thought, since it would need to be studied.
                            Foreign Secretary said President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> had again mentioned ex-President Eisenhower as
                            representing the type of individual of world stature that he had in

                        Kashmir mediation problem on basis your thorough explorations, we seem to
                        have reached impasse on both sides. Neither one has rejected mediation out
                        of hand but each has imposed conditions which make early initiation of
                        mediation impossible. Furthermore both sides seem to have rejected in
                        advance various possible compromise plans for settlement.
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> seems to have eliminated all but readjustment

                    <p>Under these circumstances we believe we should restate the basis on which we
                        have intervened in Kashmir dispute, indicate that positions <pb n="656"

                        proceed with more deliberate pace. Immediate problem is, of course, manner
                        in which Under Secretary will handle Kashmir question in Pakistan. Our
                        preliminary views on tactics both there and in New Delhi follow. Before we
                        can definitely settle question of tactics, however, we need statement of
                        Indian position which we assume will be contained in

                        steps they have taken which have lessened prospects for Kashmir settlement
                        which they agree would be so much in their interest. First during bilateral
                        talks they took actions re <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s which
                        gave Indians the tactical opportunity to question benefit to them in form of

                        compromise. Second, after detailed discussions between our governments,
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s have apparently rejected formula
                        for mediation which we believe reasonably takes their interests into

                    <p>We assume that <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s still want a Kashmir
                        settlement and it is to their interest to have this problem disposed of on a
                        reasonable basis. However, since they apparently are not prepared to accept
                        our formulation for mediation, what useful ideas can they suggest that are
                        not merely a replaying of old phonograph records? Quite frankly the US is
                        unwilling to invest substantial continued effort and prestige in trying to
                        bring two recalcitrant parties to amicable settlement of their differences

                    </list>
                    <p>After an exchange of greetings the President asked His Majesty if he would
                        like to comment on the relations between his country and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty replied that Afghanistan's geographical position necessarily
                        exerted a strong influence on its security and on its relations with the two
                        countries in question.</p>
                    <p>As for the U.S.S.R., Afghanistan had achieved its independence at about the
                        time the revolution was going on in Russia. The new Soviet regime had been
                        one of the first nations to recognize Afghanistan. This action laid the
                        basis for the friendly relations between the two countries which have
                        continued to the present time.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan have always been difficult and will
                        probably continue so for some time. Prince <persName corresp="#p_NPM1"
                            >Naim</persName>, said His Majesty, had undoubtedly explained to the
                        President last year that Afghan-Pakistan relations did not have a purely
                        political basis, but were influenced by other factors. The Durand Line must
                        be viewed not merely as a line on a map, but in human and ethnic terms. His
                        Majesty expressed gratitude for the keen interest the President had taken in
                        Afghanistan's difficulties with Pakistan, and declared that the messages and
                        letters he had received from the President on this subject had been helpful
                        and gratifying.</p>
                    <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0684"/>
                    <p>Afghanistan's most recent difficulty with Pakistan had resulted from
                        Pakistan's decision to bring economic pressure to bear on Afghanistan.
                        Pakistan had closed Afghanistan's Consulates in Pakistan. This made it
                        impossible for Afghanistan to use its customary routes to the sea.
                        Afghanistan accordingly decided it was no longer useful to maintain
                        diplomatic relations with Pakistan. There followed the long period of no
                        relations and a closed border.</p>
                    <p>At the Tehran Conference this Spring, agreement was reached to re-establish
                        diplomatic relations and reopen the Consulates. An Afghanistan Ambassador is
                        now in Karachi and a Pakistani Ambassador is expected to arrive soon in
                        Kabul. But this does not mean that the basic problem has been solved. The
                        attitude of the Pakistani Government toward the tribal areas remains a
                        vexing problem.</p>
                    <p>In these areas Pakistan has been threatening a status quo which has existed
                        since the days of British India. The Durand Line divides peoples of the same
                        ethnic strain—even of the same family. When Pakistan takes or threatens
                        action on one side of that line, the results are felt equally on both sides
                        of the line. Emotions are strong. Tribal representatives in Afghanistan turn
                        to the Government of Afghanistan, which feels obliged to state the facts on
                        its radio. This is not, said His Majesty, a question of territorial claims
                        or expansionist policy, but a matter of giving moral support to a people to
                        whom the Afghans are attached by both tradition and blood.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty declared that there had been no particular difficulties in the
                        tribal areas since Tehran. The Pakistanis had done nothing to cause a
                        deterioration of relations and his own Government was carefully watching the
                        tone of its broadcasts—not resorting to propaganda but limiting itself to
                        factual reports of occurrences. In reply to the President's comment that the
                        manner in which events are reported can be significant, His Majesty replied
                        that his Government was doing its best to preserve an atmosphere of goodwill
                        and that he knew of no complaints from Pakistan in recent months.</p>
                    <p>The President then reverted to the subject of Afghan-Soviet relations. He
                        described U.S. relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as
                        variable—better now than previously, but subject to change in the future,
                        although he hoped they would not change for the worse.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty said that prior to the signing of the border agreement in 1948
                        there had been numerous difficulties along the Afghan-Soviet border. There
                        were disputes over some of the islands in the Oxus River, and incidents had
                        arisen as the result of individuals and animals straying across the border.
                        Since 1948 no such problems had arisen. Indeed, there was now no issue on
                        which there was a divergence of views between the two countries and no
                        points of friction between them.</p>
                    <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0685"/>
                    <p>On a broader level, His Majesty went on, he believed that the future of
                        Soviet-Afghan relations depended on events which could not now be foreseen,
                        including the whole trend of events in Asia.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the President's question as to Soviet policy objectives toward
                        Afghanistan, His Majesty replied that if one took the long view it was
                        impossible to ignore the Soviet ideological outlook and that Afghanistan was
                        always conscious of the problem created by the Soviet's broad policy
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>The President said that it was his impression that the Soviets had not pushed
                        their ideological views on Afghanistan, and that he had always been curious
                        as to why they had not tried to obtain more control over that country. Did
                        His Majesty feel that the Soviets were interested only in being friends with
                        Afghanistan or did they hope ultimately to control Afghanistan?</p>
                    <p>His Majesty declared that to date the Soviets had made no effort to
                        infiltrate Afghanistan. This was due, he believed, to the Soviet's desire to
                        show other Asian countries that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        had no ulterior designs on Afghanistan and, inferentially, on other
                        countries in Asia. Should the Soviets make an effort to infiltrate or
                        penetrate Afghanistan, he continued, Afghanistan would react with every
                        means within its power. This was a situation which Afghanistan kept
                        constantly under study in order to be prepared for any eventuality.</p>
                    <p>The President noted that a number of reforms and changes had taken place in
                        Afghanistan in recent months and asked His Majesty if he would care to
                        comment on internal economic and social conditions in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>Afghanistan's first Five-Year Plan, His Majesty replied, had run into many
                        difficulties but at the same time had been fairly successful. He had more
                        hope of accomplishing the objectives of the second Five-Year Plan because
                        Afghanistan had now had more experience in development and more trained
                        personnel. Economic development is of course a relative matter but in his
                        opinion Afghanistan is making substantial headway.</p>
                    <p>Economic development in Afghanistan is proceeding hand in hand with social
                        development, His Majesty added. He then asked Minister Rishtiya to describe
                        some of the changes that are taking place.</p>
                    <p>The Minister said that Afghanistan's first preoccupation after obtaining
                        independence was the security of the country. Now, with a new generation on
                        the scene, there is an opportunity to move forward on the social front. His
                        Majesty had separated the Government from the throne and for the first time
                        given Afghanistan a government of commoners. A new constitution is being
                        prepared, new electoral and press laws are being drafted and Afghanistan is
                        to be given a more up-to-date democratic government in which the people will
                        have a greater share in public affairs. This transition is being
                        accomplished quietly and <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0686"/>smoothly
                        after many years of preparation. In this effort Afghanistan needs the
                        encouragement and cooperation of its friends.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty remarked that his people desired greater freedom, and that their
                        desire for independence is particularly strong. Afghanistan has always had a
                        democratic tradition. The new reforms are based on a recognition of the
                        nation's traditions and capabilities.</p>
                    <p>The President commented that the key is equilibrium—that it is extremely
                        difficult to maintain stability in a free society. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>, he remarked with a smile, had had
                        some trouble on this score.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty remarked that in his country as in others change was inevitable.
                        In Asian countries in particular there existed a real danger that leftist
                        tendencies would take over if the inevitability of change was not recognized
                        by those in authority. He asked the President which was better: to make
                        changes on a calculated basis or to wait until they are brought about by
                        other factors.</p>
                    <p>The President replied that it is always hazardous for a single group to
                        retain all power, and particularly so if this group holds its power by
                        inheritance. In his opinion, His Majesty had acted wisely. It is
                        particularly important to keep in mind the religion, geography, tribal
                        traditions and basic philosophies of a people when effecting social changes.
                        This His Majesty seemed to have done. Consequently, his program was more
                        likely to succeed than the program in, say, Morocco.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty stated that he himself was very hopeful of the outcome in
                        Afghanistan. The cooperation of the Afghan people had been most encouraging.
                        Their readiness for change is illustrated by the fact that whereas he had
                        expected it to take three years to emancipate women, this had been
                        accomplished in six months. In his judgment the basic character of the
                        Afghan people is such that the reform program will be successfully and
                        peacefully realized.</p>
                    <p>The meeting broke up after the President's expression of pleasure that he and
                        His Majesty would have further opportunities to discuss these and other
                        matters in which they were both interested.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> began the meeting by reading from
                        a prepared statement which he said was designed to summarize the positions
                        of the two governments as they had emerged during the previous discussions.
                        His manner was serious and deliberate.</p>

                        conversation later at lunch with Brigadier Nawazish, Director of Military
                        Intelligence, that Musa, Nawazish and probably Foreign Office officials met

                        party arrived on time but meeting was delayed ten minutes while paper was
                        being typed for <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>. Clear from what

                        and <persName>Ahmed</persName> at start of meeting that this paper was
                        result of earlier conference and represented rather hasty formulation of
                        inchoate government position which up to this time had never been explicitly
                        stated, although strong resistance of US military aid to India was already a
                        clearly established government policy. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1"

                    <p>He said as he understood it the US position was as follows: (1) Arms aid to
                        India will continue; (2) A settlement of Kashmir cannot be linked to
                        military assistance to India; and (3) Certain measures had been suggested to
                        increase the credibility of US assurances to Pakistan. These included (A)
                        Restatement of US assurances against an attack including an attack from
                        India; (B) Joint staff talks about the communist threat but not about the
                        threat from India; (C) The possibility of stockpiling military equipment;
                        (D) Combined joint exercises in Fiscal '65.</p>
                    <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0688"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then said the Pakistan position
                        could be summarized as follows: (1) Any military aid to India beyond the
                        Nassau program was unwarranted by military considerations. If it continues,
                        judging by India's past conduct, the threat to small neighboring countries,
                        especially Pakistan, which has already increased, will be augmented further.
                        (2) China has no intention of attacking India nor can India attack China
                        because physical and climatic barriers will not permit it. If a clash
                        occurs, it will be only of a very, very limited nature. (3) To meet that
                        limited threat the Indian Army, even before American military assistance
                        started, was more than enough. (4) The additional armed forces India has
                        created and intends to expand further with the use of its own resources and
                        those provided by friendly powers, will impose a crippling economic burden
                        on Indian economy. There are already signs of the Indian peoples acute
                        resentment against this diversion of resources. If this goes on, it may well
                        be a prelude to disintegration and strife on a large scale. Such a situation
                        can only be to the advantage of the Communists. (5) Indians are doing all
                        this with their eyes open. If they cannot bring this force to bear against
                        the Chinese—which they cannot—then they will have to justify its creation by
                        showing military gains elsewhere. So from whatever angle one looks at it,
                        expansion of Indian Armed Forces was a mistake and any further support from
                        outside cannot be justified on military grounds. (6) Pakistan understands
                        and appreciates US desire to protect the subcontinent from Communist
                        aggression. (7) The only logical way of bringing this about is a
                        rapprochement between India and Pakistan through a just and honorable
                        settlement of Kashmir problem so that a disengagement of India and Pakistani
                        forces can be brought about. If this occurs the two nations will then be
                        free to face their respective second fronts. (8) In view of the
                        unprecedented increase in Indian Armed Forces and the resultant increase of
                        the threat to Pakistan's security, “it has become imperative for Pakistan to
                        bring down its political and military liabilities within its means.” This
                        can be achieved only if we “normalize our relations with as many of our
                        neighbors as possible.” This has been the basis of Pakistan's approach to
                        China, and Pakistan hopes it can bring about some form of understanding with
                        the Soviet Union as well. In that connection the attempt to normalize
                        relations with Afghanistan is the first step. (9) Pakistan does not see any
                        alternative open to it except this. If there were a power prepared to
                        underwrite part, Pakistan would not hesitate to undertake them. [sic] But in
                        the absence of that, the course Pakistanis are adopting is the only one
                        rationally open to Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        then said that he would like to comment on the following points which Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had raised in the previous
                            meeting:<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">Reported in telegram 17 from
                            Rawalpindi.</note> (1) Kashmir mediation; (2) Joint planning <pb n="663"

                        India; (3) Stockpiling of military equipment; and (4) Combined joint
                        exercises in Fiscal Year 1965.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that he would first comment
                        on the military problem. As he understood it Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> had suggested joint planning against the communist
                        threat. As Pakistan sees it that threat can only come from the Soviets
                        because physical barriers prevent a threat from the Chinese. If that is the
                        case the Soviet threat will not be just against Pakistan. The Soviets will
                        move for bigger aims, the least being the domination of the Middle East and
                        Persian Gulf ports from Karachi west. This would mean that not only Pakistan
                        but Iran, Iraq and Turkey would be affected. In fact this would amount to a
                        state of global war. There is already, said <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>, a forum, i.e. <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>,
                        for such planning. In these circumstances bilateral planning would not be
                        meaningful. In any case Pakistan is immediately threatened by India. Things
                        like stockpiling and joint exercises have to flow from a precise military
                        plan to have meaning. Since the composition of a stockpile and the
                        development of a plan must be directed towards a particular threat from
                        India, the things suggested by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> seemed to be useless.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then turned to the Kashmir
                        mediation problem. He said he respected the good intentions of the US and
                        realized that we have limitations and were working within them. He also
                        recognized the fact that the acceptance of mediation would have a good
                        effect on Pakistan's image in the Congress. He said that he and his advisors
                        had given the matter much thought. They had concluded that if Pakistan
                        accepted mediation on current terms this action would lead to disturbances
                        in Kashmir and disruption in Pakistan itself. In a democratic form of
                        government you could expect the people to indicate strongly their feelings.
                        The opposition would bitterly attack the government as they had fourteen
                        times before.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then read from a recent
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> statement in the Raja Sabha in which
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> said that any alteration in the status of
                        Kashmir would be disastrous for the people of Kashmir, India and Pakistan.
                        In face of this, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> says, Pakistan
                        sees no future in mediation at this stage. Although he did not believe that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> would change he thought the US should attempt
                        in Delhi to see what possibility there was of movement towards a Kashmir
                        settlement. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> recalled that during
                        President Eisenhower's visit to Pakistan he had said that he hoped to see
                        whether he could get countries together. Eisenhower didn't succeed. Later
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> worked on
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> with no success. Most recently Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> tried but didn't get very
                        far. <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan Sandys</persName> was more aggressive
                        but he had no more success with <persName>Nehru</persName> than the
                        others.</p>
                    <p>These were all in effect mediators—none of them got very far. It is illogical
                        to think that <persName>Nehru</persName>, who is now assured of continued
                        military aid from the United States, even in the absence of a Chinese
                        threat, has <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0690"/>any compulsion to move
                        on Kashmir. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said the time for
                        this is past, and opportunity had been lost. He added, “our relations with
                        India are already bad. Don't let them get worse.” He said that it was
                        necessary to wait for a more propitious moment but frankly he didn't see
                        this in the future. He realized that the US was perhaps doing its best but
                        he believed that there was no possibility of movement towards a Kashmir
                        solution at present.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he was grateful for the
                        clear and comprehensive presentation by <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> after two days of useful discussions in which there had
                        been a full exploration of the views of both governments. He told <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that he would report these
                        conversations fully to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> probably next Monday. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then commented on <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s remarks. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s presentation and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName>'s other talks in Pakistan had shown that, while there
                        is fundamental agreement on the type of world US and Pakistan would like to
                        see and on the broad objectives of their policies, there remain significant
                        differences between them based on different analyses of world US and
                        Pakistan would like to see and the effects of specific policies and the
                        tactics appropriate to achieve the common objectives. He was struck and
                        concerned by Ayub's statement yesterday and again today that Pakistan saw no
                        alternative but to proceed toward normalization of relations with Communist
                        China and ultimately with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>He asked what normalization might mean in specific terms. The work might be
                        interpreted to mean that Pakistan intended to move away from being an
                        effective ally against the common threat of Communism in the discussion of
                        neutralism. If this were Pakistan's objective, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asserted, it was neither a viable nor
                        a necessary policy alternative for Pakistan for three reasons.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, the US is providing military aid to India on the basis of only
                            a limited program tailored in conformity with its appraisal of <gloss
                                target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> capabilities and intentions and
                            surrounded by—hedged in by—a number of safeguards. In explaining the
                            safeguards, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out
                            that, by being the main HQ of supply of arms to India, the US was in a
                            position, where in the event of an Indian attack on Pakistan, could
                            terminate its assistance abruptly in a manner severely reducing Indian
                            military capabilities. Furthermore military aid to India was being
                            furnished under specific conditions that took account of such a
                            contingency. Our arrangements explicitly limited the use of the materiel
                            we supplied to defense against Communist aggression.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, the US has given Pakistan straightforward assurances on
                            coming to its aid if it should be attacked from any source. The US does
                            not make such promises lightly and the whole of our national history
                            shows that we keep our promises. The suggestions that he made yesterday,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued, for joint
                            planning, stockpiling, and joint exercises were <pb n="665"
                                xml:id="pg_665" facs="0691"/>intended to give an additional quantum
                            or material reality to this assurance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> had pointed out that in his judgment these
                            suggestions did not meet Pakistani requirements if planning were limited
                            to the Communist menace and did not encompass an attack from India.
                            However, we had a different view. We felt that the military staffs of
                            both countries could get together for joint planning, a joint appraisal
                            of the Communist threat, and the appropriate response. The determination
                            of the response against a Communist threat would assure Pakistan of our
                            capabilities to move quickly to defend it against any aggression since
                            it would involve a full discussion of our ability to move men and
                            supplies quickly into Pakistan. This should provide a basis for greater
                            confidence and assurance on the part of Pakistan. Furthermore the
                            stockpiling of equipment in advance would provide further security that
                            necessary materiel would be available. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> urged that President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> continue to give consideration to these
                            proposals.</item>
                        <item>Third, a policy of neutrality or neutralism was not a viable policy
                            option for a country such as Pakistan which is surrounded, as it is, by
                            real danger on two sides from vast communist powers and that finds
                            itself next door to the vast Indian nation. Given Pakistan's relative
                            scale of resources, any attempt to find security by moving toward
                            neutralism or even non-commitment against the Communist bloc would be
                            illusory. It would result in the inevitable erosion of Pakistan's
                            independence and a loss of the values Pakistan cherishes.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that, in all
                        seriousness, the US feels that the future of Pakistan lies in a closer
                        working relationship with the US. However any movement by Pakistan in a
                        contrary direction would result in a new situation. It would inevitably
                        require an adjustment of policies on both sides and a very close
                        re-examination of current US-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> could not believe this is
                        what Pakistan desired. He hoped, instead, that the US and Pakistan would
                        continue to explore ways and means to develop a course of action that would
                        give Pakistan the sense of security it desires within the framework of
                        present policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> assured <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> that he would report fully and
                        objectively on his visit and that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1"
                            >Kennedy</persName> and the US Government would take these reports into
                        full account. However, he could not, in all honesty, say that there would
                        be, as a result, a major shift in a US policy that was very fully considered
                        before we took steps to assist India militarily. He hoped that US and
                        Pakistan could agree to focus their efforts on an exploration of actions
                        within the framework of continued but limited military aid to India. We felt
                        that within this policy it was possible to provide an adequate measure of
                        security for Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The US continues to feel it important to work closely with Pakistan and
                        maintain an honest friendship since the two countries have strong common
                        interests. If, on the other hand this is not possible, we both face <pb
                            n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0692"/>serious problems. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> again stressed that he could not tell
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> how US policy could be
                        adjusted to meet such a new situation. Up to now we have proceeded on the
                        assumption that the close alliance to US would persist and we would far
                        prefer to continue on this assumption.</p>
                    <p>In concluding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that at
                        this point he frankly felt the next step was for him to make a full report
                        to the President since Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                            >Bhutto</persName> would be coming over to Washington soon and frank and
                        comprehensive conversations could be continued. He assured President
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> again that the US very
                        highly valued its relations with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then again said that he was
                        puzzled by the word “normalization” and asked that Pakistan intentions be
                        elucidated. He said that “normalization” suggested to him a move toward
                        neutrality or neutralism.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> replied that it was natural for
                        any country to want normal relations with its neighbors. Pakistan has
                        problems with these neighbors and he could not see how Pakistan could exist
                        without normalizing relations with Communist China, Russia, and even with
                        India. He pointed out that Pakistan, as an ideological state, had major
                        differences in its philosophy of life from the Communists and the Hindus. It
                        has no intention of permitting these neighbors to overwhelm Pakistan. It
                        just wants to “keep them on their side of the line.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then castigated neutralism as a
                        gross form of opportunism which he looked upon with contempt. He assured Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that Pakistan had no
                        intention of turning to neutralism unless “absolutely compelled.” He said
                        compelling circumstances had not yet arisen. On the contrary the basis of
                        Pakistan foreign policy is friendship with the US. He said that we feel we
                        need each other.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> felt Pakistan did, however, have
                        cause for complaint against its friend. It did not complain about Soviet
                        action since it expected no better from the Russians. It expected much more
                        from its best friend. Pakistan's interests have been hurt and its security
                        jeopardized against all reason and logic. But Pakistan still places high
                        value on its friendship with the US. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> urged that the US should not further aggravate an
                        already difficult situation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then challenged Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s statement that we would cut off aid
                        to India in event of aggression. He pointed out that over years the United
                        States had taken no steps to diminish aid to India in spite of
                            <persName>Nehru</persName>'s constant criticism of US policy and support
                        of Communist China. He doubted whether circumstances would ever arise that
                        would lead us to cut off aid. We would be compelled to continue aid and play
                        into the Indian hands. As he had mentioned yesterday the Indian game is to
                        get what she can from the US and then slowly, not very suddenly, eliminate
                        US influence. He thought it would not be easy to shut off the tap and that
                        there were grave limitations in our ability to squeeze India.</p>
                    <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0693"/>
                    <p>Summing up, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> again urged that we
                        not aggravate Pakistan's problems. He asked that we review our appraisal of
                        the military threat to India and the justification for its military buildup.
                        He urged that we save India from moving to the point of disintegration.
                        Don't jeopardize our interests, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        said, and we do feel that the United States is jeopardizing them. Finally,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> reiterated that
                        normalization of relations with the Communist Bloc did not mean neutralism,
                        which is not the solution to Pakistan's problems, but keeping them on their
                        side of the line.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pressed <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> further to indicate the areas where
                        normalization would take place. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        replied that Pakistan wished to reduce its military and political
                        liabilities. Pakistan doesn't want war with its neighbors but if aggression
                        comes it is prepared to fight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> asked whether Pakistan intended formal withdrawal from
                        its alliance relations since normalization and a defensive alliance were not
                        necessarily compatible. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> retorted
                        “are we so mad to withdraw from defensive alliances since they give us
                        peace?” <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then argued that by
                        normalizing its relations with the Communist Bloc Pakistan would be reducing
                        US commitments since it would be reducing the risk of a conflict. He
                        mentioned, for example, the normalization of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>-Chinese border.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought it difficult for a
                        nation to reduce its military vulnerability by “normalizing” relations with
                        an enemy without making a basic change in its attitude or its conduct, which
                        would put into question its basic fidelity to its own institutions and
                        traditions. He said that normalization of relations was a loose term. It
                        could mean, for example, merely increased commercial ties or greater
                        cultural exchanges. These in themselves increased rather than reduced the
                        influence of other states. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        agreed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then said that Pakistan had
                        nothing to surrender to Communist China once its boundary was demarcated. On
                        trade, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said, Pakistan was
                        entering into a manufacturing stage, producing primary and even some
                        advanced products. However, it anticipated that the common market would
                        raise its external tariffs while reducing internal tariff barriers, and that
                        while the United Kingdom was not now in the common market, the common market
                        would ultimately be extended over the advanced countries. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> pointed out that Pakistan cannot sell
                        its textiles in any quantity to the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        or Western Europe due to high tariff barriers and quota arrangements.
                        Pakistan must find other places to sell its goods in order to be in a
                        position to pay back the US for its economic assistance—which it intended to
                        do. In searching for other markets it has made small barter deals with
                        Communist China and Russia. These do not put Pakistan under any obligation
                        to the Communist states. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> pointed
                        out, in this connection, that the US is also trading with the Soviet Union,
                        which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> acknowledged but said
                        this trade was limited.</p>
                    <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0694"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that the US had
                        never asked its allies to restrain their trade with Communist states except
                        with respect to strategic items, although we did urge them to avoid building
                        up trade to a point of great dependence on the Communist Bloc.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> assured Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that the Communists cannot get an
                        economic hold on Pakistan given the very small amount of trade between them
                        and Pakistan. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that the
                        Russians have also been pressing them for cultural exchanges pointing out
                        that even the US has such cultural exchange with Russia. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that he told the Russians if they
                        want to assist them they should come up with something concrete.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> concluded that Pakistan wants to
                        remain friendly with the US unless the US drives it away. He ventured that
                        India was not a country that the US should rely on to act as its agent in
                        Asia. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to thank the
                        President for his great concern for Pakistan's problems. He had opened his
                        heart to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and had spoken in
                        all frankness. Pakistan wants to retain its friendship with the US and wants
                        American influence to remain in Asia. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> urged that US not compromise the position of its
                        friends. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that
                        what he had said did not mean that Pakistan intended to do anything
                        “stupid.” However he warned that should US policy change, and should we seek
                        to squeeze Pakistan, there would be difficulties. Pakistan, he said, “may be
                        poor but it is proud.” Pakistan is not stupid, however, and not in a hurry
                        to lose its best friend. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> urged
                        that we reconsider our policies and look at both India's and Pakistan's
                        records over the years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that relations with
                        India and Pakistan have represented two different orders of American policy,
                        since one country was an ally and the other a neutral. In India we had
                        sought mainly to maintain an influence useful for everyone.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> concluded by requesting that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> look at Pakistan's
                        arguments. Pakistan doesn't urge a radical change in US policy but putting a
                        “safety limitation on our assistance to India.” Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> assured him that the President
                        personally would give consideration to Pakistan's position. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he wished to keep the dialogue
                        going through further talks in Washington and in Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>The King: I am grateful for an opportunity of a private talk with the
                        President. I shall speak frankly because we have confidence in your
                        friendship and we wish to explore some points of genuine concern—and we
                        would like equally frank comments in return.</p>
                    <p>The President: The United States of America would like nothing better than a
                        large number of friendly and independent nations and it greatly jeopardizes
                        this aim if there are difficulties among its friends. In this connection,
                        our sincere wishes are for good relations between Afghanistan and
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The King: This question of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations is both important
                        and difficult. It has grown up during the past seven or eight years into a
                        clash of seeming principles. Behind it is some reality, much emotion and
                        heated propaganda in which all are to blame—including the Government of
                        Afghanistan. It has created hopes and aspirations in both countries which
                        cannot be ignored because of internal sympathies aroused and a hardening of
                        attitudes. We have inherited this legacy at a time that calls for something
                        else—a series of reforms that call for the unity of all forces in order to
                        bring them to a successful conclusion. Now the reforms are the basic issue.
                        They will brook no further delay. Negative elements could seize the
                        offensive and destroy any plan to use logic and reason. The administration
                        is being transferred to new elements such as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ZSM1"
                            >Zahir</persName> who was here last month. A successful development
                        would not only benefit Afghanistan but have important influence in regions
                        throughout Asia or Africa.</p>
                    <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0696"/>
                    <p>The previous administration pushed the Pushtoonistan issue to the point of
                        violence and twice our borders have been closed. What is of primary
                        importance to the new administration is how it can best carry out internal
                        reforms in a stable manner. In allowing more freedom of expression, an
                        irresponsible opposition could pick up the foreign issue and by demagoguery
                        inflame passion so as to destroy the new plans for reform. The government
                        must retain the confidence of its people and cannot ignore popular attitudes
                        that have been too long intensified. It is therefore the determination of
                        this administration to live within the Tehran agreement, refer to events as
                        merely reports (without comment) and hope that Pakistan will carry out a
                        similar policy, so that in the matter of time, the issue can be left in
                        silence. We would be quite satisfied if Pakistan would reciprocate with
                        similar actions.</p>
                    <p>This raises a second question mentioned yesterday regarding the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss> agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> concerning military arms and training. Mr. President you
                        asked whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might not use the
                        presence of technical advisers in Afghanistan and of military trainees in
                        convenient countries to create a security issue by penetrating our military
                        establishment. We were concerned with this issue after World War II when we
                        made the arrangement and continue to be anxious.</p>
                    <p>(Here His Majesty went into a lengthy description of the inadequacy of the
                        security forces in 1946—and the difficulties of any satisfactory solution.)
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-Afghan deal was—and is—a risky one
                        and at the time when world tensions were high, it seemed justified.
                        Afghanistan could trust America but could it trust countries armed by
                        America to refrain from use of those arms against Afghanistan? But the world
                        situation has changed. While military officers sent abroad are carefully
                        chosen and watched, there have been instances where individuals seem to have
                        shown immaturity and weakened before propaganda. Now it is recognized that
                        Afghanistan's army is too large and too expensive. Civil demands will
                        increase so a military reorganization is in contemplation. The territory of
                        Afghanistan is not at present threatened—so no more arms necessary. In a
                        year there will be sufficient officers trained to use the Soviet arms—so the
                        sending of officers can be discontinued. We have reviewed our decision and
                        have decided it is time to disengage. In this we need help and advice.
                        Perhaps we can rebuild and expand the Corps of Engineers for a dual
                        purpose—buildup of roads, housing, etc. By identifying our officers in the
                        army with civil and economic development, we could strengthen their pride
                        and intensify their loyalty—which is now high but can be improved and
                        redirected to a degree.</p>
                    <p>The President: I greatly appreciate this frank exposition of your views. It
                        has been illuminating, more than reading many papers. We need to discuss
                        this in more detail. Our own plans for the next year are in doubt but the
                        matter is of such importance that it should be explored.</p>
                    <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0697"/>
                    <p>The King: I am not making any formal statement here but simply exposing our
                        problem and asking for a sincere and frank discussion.</p>
                    <p>At this point the President asked that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> and the Ambassador be brought in. He asked them if
                        there would be further meetings between members of the delegation and US
                        officers before the King left. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> replied that there would be a breakfast meeting on
                        Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The President concluded the meeting as it was announced the helicopter was on
                        the lawn to take him to Otis Air Force Base.</p>

                        <item>There is no doubt that the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> from

                            deep fear of potential Indian military action to destroy Pakistan. This
                            has its roots in the frightful blood bath of the partition period. It is
                            reinforced by recollections of Indian moves to seize Janagadh,
                            Hyderabad, and Kashmir and the more recent cynical Indian absorption of
                            Goa. It is the reaction of a small nation living next door to a nation
                            four times as large which it hates and distrusts. It is pervasive
                            throughout <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> society. It is the
                            central obsessive basis of <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                            policy.</item>

                        <item>In providing military aid to India we have in Pakistan's view upset
                            military balance under which, in opinion of <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> and military commanders, West Pakistan, at least,
                            was defensible. The <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s cannot be
                            reassured merely by emphasizing the preponderately defensive character
                            of our aid to India. A key aspect of Pakistani strategy has depended on
                            their ability to strike into India in the event that India attacked
                            either the East or West wing, since the dimensions of Pakistan do not
                            permit <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0698"/>defense in depth. This
                            element of strategy is frustrated as we help increase India's defensive

                            launch a major offensive against India. Where we do not agree is in the
                            area of lesser objectives, in which Chinese might seek political,
                            psychological, or territorial gains through limited military
                            operations.</item>

                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> efforts to help <gloss

                            armies. One army would be used to deter potential Chinese attack from
                            north and the other army could be deployed and utilized in quick thrusts
                            deep into Pakistani territories. <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s
                            see, for example, that the new radar installations planned for Calcutta
                            would have a range permitting full surveillance of the very limited
                                <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> disposition of air strength in
                            East Pakistan, while the increase in Indian armor and tactical air would
                            permit an easy over-running of East Pakistan land defenses. Meanwhile
                            the present Indian army reinforced in defensive strength could contain
                            or attack West Pakistan.</item>

                        <item>Believing as they do that China will not attack India from north, they
                            see even less danger to Pakistan from any direct Chinese aggression. The
                            one area of contiguous border which they regarded as indefensible was,
                            they hoped, taken out of the play by their action in reaching an agreed
                            demarcation line with the Chinese last March.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>They do see a Chinese capability for mounting an offensive against
                            India through Burma as making far more military sense than an attack
                            from the north. But this is an area of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> planning where US defensive power would be brought
                            into play—and anyway they do not really think Chinese will mount such an

                        <item><gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>'s profound fear and hatred of an
                            aggressive India has led to a deep frustration approaching panic as they
                            have seen their ability to defend themselves jeopardized by our aid to
                            India. This frustration and despair translate into a sense of bitterness
                            and betrayal when they are reminded that the shift in military balance
                            has come about through the act of the US which they had regarded as

                            part that they must concentrate their efforts on trying to dry up flow

                            status quo in military ratio. This course apparently seems far better to

                            contributing reason for their rejection of our offer of measures to give
                            greater reality to assurances and the failure on their part to propose

                        <item>Against background of foregoing we must also take into account <gloss

                            agent in South Asia on behalf of free world, or even as an effective
                            counterbalance to Chinese theme of “Asia for Asians.” Thus <gloss
                                target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s see our policy as threatening their

                        <item>Yet in spite of all the foregoing it seems clear to me that in the

                            for an effective new orientation while at the same time profoundly
                            hoping US could be persuaded to return to former policy that would not
                            include Indian military aid.</item>
                        <label>16.</label>
                        <item>Thus, we can assume that there is still a large element of indecision
                            in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> attitude. They will not, in
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s words, do anything
                            “stupid” nor act precipitously. At the same time it is my firm view that

                            over a period of time see a gradual erosion of our influence with <gloss

                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> summed up his
                        impressions of Pakistani visit. He thought central thrust of <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> policy was deep, obsessive fear of India.
                        We were mistaken if we thought this merely tactical. <persName
                            corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked for a look at whether this fear
                        had grown in last few years—he thought it had. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                            >Harriman</persName> commented that when he saw <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> in '55 latter was optimistic over
                            Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> settlement, but no longer.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued that what touched
                        off the current outburst of <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> fears was US
                        military aid; they feel they'll be overrun—East Pakistan manifestly was
                        indefensible. But they want the old 3-1 ratio maintained at least. Their
                        main pitch to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> was to stop US aid
                        to India; but now they've conceded to <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName> they can't get this, so they want more balancing

                                ><persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> reported on
                            September 9 that he had reviewed the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> visit with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> the previous evening. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                                >Ayub</persName> indicated that he was prepared to try to live with
                            the repercussions of some limited continuation of the U.S. military
                            assistance program to India, provided that there was a balancing
                            increase in U.S. military assistance to Pakistan. (Telegram 526 from

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> went on to say that <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s own domestic position is not as
                        secure as it was; strong popular sentiment exists for a deal with China. The
                        rationale is that, after all, Americans condone Indian-Russian relationship.
                        But this line was not to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s
                        personal taste or <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s. When
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pressed <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> about precise meaning of <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> intent to go on “normalizing relations,”
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> was extremely fuzzy. He was
                        categorical that alliance with Peking was not what they had in mind. Nor
                        would they pull out of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. So what it seemed to come down to was
                        increased trade relations, perhaps cultural relations too. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> felt he had to go this far for
                        domestic political reasons, but would not go any further. So <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> saw this as an empty threat. He had no
                        real fear they'll go very far down road toward China and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, unless “pushed to the wall” as <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> put it.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about Peshawar. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> replied that when he taxed <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> privately, the latter admitted he'd made “2/3 of a
                        commitment” to <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. He needed
                        more time since Assembly was in session but intended to go ahead with
                        expansion.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked if <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> knew how little we were actually doing
                        with the Indians. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this
                        never really came up. Quinn thought the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s
                            <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0703"/>really knew; their intelligence
                        was excellent. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it must be
                        understood that the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s were not wholly
                        rational on this issue. They were reacting to the very fact we were helping,
                        not so much to the amount of help.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had dismissed <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s suggestions for closer military
                        relations with us, because he feared we'd take this as carte blanche to go
                        ahead with <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for India. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> summed up by saying we should
                        re-examine the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>-Indian military balance.
                        Perhaps we should give supersonics to neither. In the meantime, “let's be
                        cagy with <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> when he comes.” We
                        could go ahead with some economic aid before <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                            >Bhutto</persName> comes, but not the airport loan. We were not at any
                        point of immediate crisis; “<persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said
                        they wouldn't do anything stupid.” The visit gave him a chance to blow off
                        steam. We also need to do enough for <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> to permit him to hold his position, because he's a lot
                        better than anyone else in Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>The President asked why <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> had no
                        interest in pre-positioning, etc. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> said he feared we would take this as putting us in a
                        position to go ahead with India. Quinn further elaborated on their position
                        as being that <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> planning took care of
                        the Communist threat, so there was no use in bilateral planning unless we
                        were ready for planning against India.</p>
                    <p>The President left the room at this point. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName>, continuing the discussion, suggested that we not
                        resist too much any little gestures of the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s toward Peking because then they have less incentive to try
                        them. Perhaps we shouldn't have objected to the civil air agreement.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked how about pre-stocking
                        equipment for India in Pakistan, to be released only in event of Chicom
                        attack. Perhaps this was grasping for straws. <persName corresp="#p_TP1"
                            >Talbot</persName> felt the Indians wouldn't be very happy over
                        this.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was certain that over the
                        next six months the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s would become
                        interested in the dual-purpose moves we proposed. If General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stopped in Pakistan in early
                        November on his way back from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and
                        re-raised these matters, he might get a pretty good response.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> interjected that the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s feared India, with our help, would create
                        two armies, one to block the Chinese and the other to take on Pakistan.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> feeling that they had a serious military
                        problem. Indians could reach a level when they could lick the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s soon. It wasn't US military aid that
                        created this problem, but India's increase in its own military budget from
                        around a $750 million level before the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss> attack to $1.8-$2 billion later. Our aid to India was
                        marginal so far. But we couldn't build up Pakistan to the point where it
                        matched far larger India. The only useful counter for the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s was not US military aid, but the promise
                        of US military support if they were attacked. Since the <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s couldn't possibly match Indians, they'd
                        increasingly <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0704"/>look to us for the
                        military guarantee China couldn't really give them. It was too far away. So
                        let's pursue this line when <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> is
                        here, and then when <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> goes
                        out.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether the real problem was
                        fear of India or <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> fear that an Indian
                        buildup would prevent <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> military pressure
                        on India over Kashmir.</p>
                    <p>The President returned to the room, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> summarized the sense of the meeting: (1) We had
                        reasonable assurance the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s won't withdraw
                        from <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>; (2) We had reasonable assurance on continued use of
                        Peshawar and a fair prospect they will go ahead with expansion; (3) We were
                        not so sure there wouldn't be further flirtations with the Chinese. However,
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that these were
                        unlikely to go very far and we should not make too much noise about them.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> couldn't believe that they'd
                        go as far as defense relations with the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                            >Rusk</persName> was not so sure, so felt we should look at the
                        alternative possibilities.</p>
                    <p>The President wondered if there wasn't danger of an informal understanding
                        that the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s would attack India if the
                            <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s did. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Quinn both thought this highly
                        unlikely. The <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s didn't want to get
                        overcommitted to Peiping. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s
                        visit would also produce some <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> second
                        thoughts, as was already evident from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s subsequent talk with <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1"
                            >McConaughy</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about Joe Alsop's thesis that the <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s just might attack again.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> said <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        doesn't think so; Joe was just sniffing the fearful air of New Delhi.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> described how General
                        Quinn had beaten <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> at golf,
                        despite <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s orders, Quinn briefly
                        described the difference in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> and US
                        estimates of the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> threat. In
                        essence there was only minor disagreement over capabilities, but a larger
                        one on intentions. The <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s just didn't
                        think the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s would attack again, but
                        we saw this as a possibility.</p>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> attempted to justify
                                Pakistan's steps toward “normalization” as intrinsically minor
                                matters, on which Pakistan could be trusted not to go too far, and
                                tried to defer any further discussion of this matter.</item>

                            <item>We found, however, that <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                                    >Bhutto</persName> continued to question the necessity for more

                                on both sides. For instance, <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                                    >Bhutto</persName> again made the suggestion, which the
                                President rejected as self-defeating, that the US should use the
                                leverage of its military aid to India to induce the <gloss

                                expressed strong indignation at recent Indian moves designed to
                                integrate Kashmir into India and concern at American aid for
                                rebuilding the road from Srinagar to Leh.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>The President suggested that it might be useful for General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to go to Pakistan
                                to examine with Pakistan military leaders the measures which we

                                    >Bhutto</persName> welcomed this suggestion and we anticipate
                                that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will

                            <item>Costs (pp. 9-10). These are very crudely estimated at $300 million
                                annually for each carrier and associated air group, escorts, etc.
                                But one cannot blithely accept this figure as the new out-of-pocket
                                cost of putting a one carrier force in the Indian Ocean, because:
                                (a) it includes amortization of capital outlay for the carrier,
                                planes, associated air group, which costs have already been
                                incurred; (b) Indian Ocean force might well need fewer escorts, less
                                high performance aircraft etc. because of reduced air/sea threat and

                                Indian Ocean than almost anywhere else, simply because this is the

                                here theater-based forces are most needed to (a) improve probability

                                Indian <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0708"/>Ocean: (1) providing

                                    <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> area later than WE or <gloss

                                where land bases are not immediately available. We have no US land

                                be very expensive. There are allied air bases, but presumably any
                                aggressor would strike these first (e.g. in Iran) unless they were

                    <p>Pakistan has added a new dimension to its tactics and appears to be
                        attempting “to prove” its charge that India has aggressive intentions
                        against Pakistan. In the last few weeks we have received three Pakistan
                            Aide-Memoires,<note n="1" xml:id="d335fn1">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note>
                        the main points of which are: (1) Recent Indian statements regarding Kashmir
                        are contrary to U.N. resolutions and India has increased its hostile
                        activities along the cease-fire line; (2) United States military assistance
                        to India is being misused by India and has been issued to units facing
                        Pakistan; (3) The radar we are giving India sweeps Pakistan territory.</p>
                    <p>A fuller explanation of the validity of these charges is given below, but in
                        brief our view is as follows: (1) The proposals by the outgoing Prime
                        Minister of Indian-held Kashmir would, if adopted, be contrary to U.N.
                        resolutions. There is no evidence of increased Indian military activity in
                        Kashmir; on the contrary, there is some evidence that Pakistan has increased
                        its military strength in the area. (2) We have no evidence that India has
                        diverted equipment in militarily significant quantities to units facing
                        Pakistan. (3) The radar in Calcutta will cover portions of East
                        Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>Chet Bowles is very anxious to get some flavor of your current thinking about
                        India-Pakistan tomorrow. He's putting up a brave front but actually feeling
                        a bit low, and wondering whether we're still signed on to moving ahead with
                        India.</p>
                    <p>We've explained to Chet that it isn't our policy but circumstances that have
                        changed. Neither we nor the Indians could keep up the accelerated pace
                        stimulated by the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> attack last
                        October. The Hill revolt against foreign aid in general was another blow. So
                        Ken skimmed off the cream, while Chet got out there just in time for the
                            <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> fiasco and then Bokaro. Finally, the
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s have pre-empted center stage in
                        their major campaign to spike our India program; by being so difficult they
                        have in fact partly achieved their objective.</p>
                    <p>The important thing to do with <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        is to reassure him that we intend to go forward with India, while getting
                        him to set his sights a little lower and more realistically: <list>

                                the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s) and to limit their take
                                from the Soviets (see his memo attached).<note n="1"

                                than the $50 million a year the Pentagon has been thinking about.
                                Chet feels he can sell such a package to Delhi. Query—are we able to
                                make a five-year commitment just now?</item>

                                last winter, but no further movement is likely until another such
                                break comes along. The trouble is the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                    >Pak</gloss>s are now whomping up the Kashmir issue as a means

                                differences and thus proving their point that India is really out to

                                and get credit for Bokaro by offering much less than the $500
                                million we couldn't swallow. He'd dearly love to forestall the
                                Soviets here, but it's hard to see what we can do at this moment
                                without annoying the Congress.</item>

                    <p>When Chet Bowles saw the President 13 November, the latter was favorably
                        impressed in principle with Chet's pitch that it might be possible to trade
                        off a 5-year US military commitment (at $65-$75 million or so) for at least
                        a tacit understanding that the Indians would not exceed certain reasonable
                        force goals, would limit their buys from the Soviets, and would take a more
                        active role in our grand strategy against China. Chet thought that such a
                        force ceiling would make continued <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for
                        India more palatable to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s, and would
                        also limit the amount of free foreign exchange India would divert to defense
                        at the expense of development.</p>
                    <p>The President's view was that Chet might have an interesting proposition even
                        if it had only a 50-50 chance of success or even if we didn't get full
                        performance. I attach the papers<note n="1" xml:id="d338fn1">Not attached.

                                >footnote 1, Document 337</ref>, a chart detailing the estimated

                            memorandum entitled “Proposed Programs for <gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Chet mentioned India's desire for defense production aid (further highlighted
                        in <persName>Nehru</persName>'s recent letter, Delhi 1625).<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d338fn2">See <ref target="#d336">Document 336</ref>.</note> I
                        suggested, however, that we might not want to build up too much of an
                        indigenous production base at this time, since it made India less dependent
                        on us and was the facet which most worried the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>s.</p>
                    <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0717"/>
                    <p>The President asked that he be given a preliminary Washington view on this in
                        time to discuss it again with <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                        before the latter left. I've also told <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Phil
                            Talbot</persName> about this and suggested a 22 November deadline for a
                        joint State-Defense memo, so we can give it to the President for weekend
                        reading.</p>
                    <p>While Chet told the President he would really like something on the order of
                        $75 million annually, he also presented attached estimate that some $314
                        million over five years might do the trick. He noted that these figures
                        would need to be carefully reviewed (I pointed out that <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s current thinking was more on the order of
                        $50 million a year, and an 18 division and 39 squadron ceiling). Also, a
                        5-year commitment a la Iran was hard to make at a time when future aid
                        prospects were so uncertain. However, in response to the President, I did
                        hazard, on the basis of previous talks with you, that if necessary <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> could probably find another $10-$12 million
                        a year for Indian <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>My own reaction is that if in fact we're now involved in a long term <gloss
                            target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> relationship (on the order of $50 million
                        plus annually), why not see how much we can use this leverage to get some
                        things from Delhi that we really want? If <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> turns out to be over-optimistic, have we really lost
                        very much?</p>

                        conveyed the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that intermittent deployment

                    <p>The political objectives of the carrier force deployment, as noted in the
                        August 173 and October 17 letters of the Secretary of State, are to provide
                        a visible U.S. military presence in the Indian Ocean area in order to help
                        deter potential aggressors, reassure our allies and stabilize certain
                        intra-regional disputes among our friends, e.g., India and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the foregoing, the Department of State has provided specific
                        political guidance to be used in developing an initial carrier task force

                    <p>Consistent with the foregoing, I request that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        provide, at an early date, a proposed schedule for an initial carrier task
                        deployment in the Indian Ocean for two months out of six. If feasible, the
                        first six months period should begin with December 1963. This proposed
                        schedule will be used as the basis for final political clearances prior to
                        the first deployment.</p>

                    <p>The second suggestion of the Secretary of State, to study an eight months per
                        year deployment, will be undertaken in the near future. The Assistant
                        Secretary of Defense (ISA) will coordinate Defense action in this
                        matter.</p>

                        briefly the intelligence community's feeling of concern and their view that
                        our Pakistan relationship was of the greatest importance.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> mentioned the forthcoming December meeting
                        between <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. The President made no comment but
                        seemed to feel that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> should
                        remain in the United States because of serious Defense budget problems.
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> reviewed the great number of commitments we
                        have made to Pakistan and that we would come to their defense if India
                        should use our arms to attack Pakistan. The President expressed the greatest
                        of confidence in <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and a feeling
                        that we had not been forceful enough with him, had not given him a feeling
                        of confidence in our motives and that he had drifted into the thought that
                        we would abandon him in favor of India. He stated that he wished this
                        corrected in a most positive manner.</p>

                        and that he would stay as long as necessary to meet the President and
                        deliver it.</p>
                    <p>At beginning of conversation <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>
                        handed President written message (text being transmitted septel)<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d341fn2">Telegram 756 to Karachi, December 2. (Ibid.)</note>
                        from President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> expressing warm
                        friendship and best wishes. After <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                            >Bhutto</persName> had amplified message by his own comments and had
                        heard President's appropriate response, it became clear that he thought
                        purpose of meeting had been served and that he did not expect to discuss
                        substantive issues in US-Pakistan relations.</p>
                    <p>The President then referred to <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                        >Bhutto</persName>'s statements that in spite of some difficulties the
                        association between the people of Pakistan and the US was fundamentally
                        strong and that the US still had a true friend in Pakistan. He thanked
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> for these sentiments, said
                        he was indeed a friend of Pakistan and would continue to be one if Pakistan
                        would let him. He said the American people and Congressional leaders had
                        known Pakistan as resolutely strong against Communists. Now he understood
                        Pakistan was going to have a state visit by the leaders of Communist China.
                        He wanted <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to know there would
                        be a serious public relations problem here if Pakistan should build up its
                        relations with the Communist Chinese. He was not pro-Pakistani or pro-Indian
                        but pro-Free World. Such a state visit would make it increasingly difficult
                        for us.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said he appreciated this but he
                        wanted the President to understand that Pakistan had its own public opinion.
                        He could not describe the intensity of Pakistani feeling about India. India
                        was bigger and stronger and Pakistan could never forget Indian
                        antagonism.</p>
                    <p>To this the President responded that the Pakistani people knew that we would
                        not let India attack Pakistan. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> knew this. Pakistan <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695"
                            facs="0721"/>had our assurances that we would live up to our
                        commitments. We would also make sure that we would do nothing to hurt
                        Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> replied that Pakistan, being an
                        ideological state itself, understood the strength of other ideological
                        states such as the Communist ones. There were dangers but Pakistan could be
                        trusted to handle them. US actions which contribute to the growing power of
                        India were driving Pakistan to the wall. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub
                            Khan</persName> had the strength to stand against this trend. Pakistan
                        did not want to end its relations with the U.S. Yet everything since the
                        Chinese attack on India had confirmed Pakistan's views that Southeast Asia,
                        not India, was the object of the Chinese appetite. But, the President
                        interjected, it is you who are going to sit down to eat with the Chinese
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>In response to an assertion that the Chinese leaders were going to visit a
                        number of Asian and African states, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> said that these included such countries as Mali,
                        Guinea, Ghana, and Somali—countries with which the Communists have been
                        involved—and this was fine company for Pakistan to put itself in.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the strongest men in Congress in favor of Pakistan
                        are also the strongest against the Chinese Communists. The Chinese state
                        visit was coming just at a time when we are making strenuous efforts to keep
                        our alliances strong and our foreign aid program going. There was great
                        opposition to aid. These were facts of life. When the Congressional leaders
                        learned of the state visit, their adverse reactions could be expected.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> replied that he could
                        understand this but asked that the U.S. also examine with Pakistan the
                        difficulties American actions were causing it.</p>
                    <p>In parting, the President said again that he was a friend of Pakistan and
                        would remain so. He asked <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> to
                        give his warm regards to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>.</p>
                    <p>When <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> saw <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> off at the airport later same
                        evening <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> showed himself deeply
                        upset and disturbed by turn conversation had taken. He seemed to regret that
                        he had not taken issue with the President's statements and said he could not
                        understand why the Chinese visit had been raised in this way. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> explained again corrosive effect on
                        our relations of increasing Pakistani relations with Communist China. We
                        have strong indications both the Chinese and the Soviets are extending area
                        of their conflict to embrace subcontinent and we regretted seeing our ally
                        Pakistan become an instrument of Chinese Communist ploys. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> spoke from his heart and
                        out of realities of American interests when he had reaffirmed his friendship
                        with Pakistan, when he had said he wanted to continue this friendship, when
                        he had made clear we would not let India attack Pakistan, and when he had
                        expressed his deep concerns over Pakistan's involvements with Chinese
                        Communists. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName> added that we
                        indeed appreciated <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0722"/>Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>'s strenuous efforts to come to
                        Washington and acknowledged with gratitude the Pakistani tribute inherent in
                        his action. On our side we were anxious to retain and strengthen this
                        friendship. Unfortunately, when Pakistan got itself mixed up with Communist
                        China this tied our hands domestically and also, of course, removed any
                        leverage we might have had to influence India in direction of accommodation
                        with Pakistan.</p>

                            >Bell</persName> recommends a major initiative toward India. Its genesis
                        was a proposal by <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> that since
                        we were probably going to be giving India substantial military aid against
                        the <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s anyway, why not package it in
                        such a way as to get the maximum from the Indians? So he suggested trading
                        an informal indication of our longer-term <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                            >MAP</gloss> plans for Indian assurances that they would limit their own
                        buildup, not divert too much from development to defense, and not lean too
                        heavily on Soviet military aid. We fear Khrushchev may be coming to India
                        shortly with some military goodies, so would like to start moving first.</p>
                    <p>The chief risk is a tough Pakistani reaction, unless we handle the
                        transaction with skill. But we cannot afford to give the Pakistani a veto on
                        our Indian policy, when we have a major opportunity to move India closer to
                        us. Moreover, to mollify the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s we would
                        plan on a similar long-term <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> commitment

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> proposes that we
                            make a five-year military assistance commitment to India in exchange for
                            Indian decisions to limit their force levels, hold down procurement of
                            military equipment from the Soviet Bloc, hold to a minimum diversion of
                            foreign exchange from economic development, exercise restraint in
                            relations with Pakistan, and cooperate with us in the containment of
                            Communist China. He believes that there is a reasonable chance that
                            India will make these decisions, if our offer is good enough. (See
                            Enclosure 1.)<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">Enclosure 1 is the November 12

                                >AID</gloss> agree that if we could reach some such understanding
                            with India, it would be well worthwhile. A steady long-term policy of
                            military cooperation with India would do much to stabilize our
                            relationship and serve our long-term political aim of pulling India
                            closer to the United States. Indian decisions to settle on moderate
                            force levels would hold down Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss><pb
                                n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0724"/>tensions. We would achieve some
                            preclusion in fact, and excessive Soviet penetration of the Indian
                            military would be prevented. Major diversions of foreign exchange from
                            economic development, to which we are so heavily committed, would be
                            avoided. (Over the past three years India has spent an average of $95
                            million of its own foreign exchange for defense; estimates indicate this
                            figure may go as high as $160 million for Indian <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964. This would put real pressure on the Indian
                            development program.) Since we will probably provide substantial <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to India over the next several years
                            anyway, we ought to maximize the leverage we get from it by proceeding
                            along the above lines.</p>
                        <p>We believe, however, that we should stop somewhere short of as explicit a
                            commitment as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>
                            suggests, and should approach it more cautiously, rather than laying all
                            our cards on the table at the outset. Such tactics would leave us
                            greater freedom of action to gauge the likely Pakistani reaction, and to
                            find out whether the Indians would indeed be sufficiently responsive,
                            before deciding how much of our own plans to divulge. Nonetheless, we
                            would go ahead now with the preparation of a five-year <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program for India in the $50-$60
                            million annual range, so that we would be prepared, if the timing were
                            ripe and the Indian response to our initial probes satisfactory, to
                            divulge our longer term plans.</p>
                        <p>Proposal for Pakistan</p>
                        <p>In the years since 1954, we have established a pattern of military
                            assistance to Pakistan which in many respects resembles the one which we
                            are now suggesting for India. We have agreed to modernize and maintain
                            five and a half divisions and to modernize the Pakistan air force. The
                            latter has come to mean that eventually we will replace the obsolescent
                            F-86 squadrons with supersonic aircraft. (Pakistan already has one
                            squadron of F-104s which we delivered in 1961.) We have told the
                            Pakistanis from time to time of the quantities of certain types of
                            equipment we were planning to deliver to meet our commitments. By
                            providing this level of support, we were able to make it possible for
                            the Pakistanis to limit their over-all force goals and the diversion of
                            their foreign exchange to military expenditures.</p>
                        <p>One reason for caution about moving ahead too fast in revealing to India
                            our longer term <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> plans is that these
                            might leak prematurely to Pakistan and cause a violent reaction before
                            we had laid the necessary groundwork. To mitigate the Pakistani reaction
                            we might provide them too, at roughly the same time, with an indication
                            of our longer term <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> intentions,
                            perhaps for the next three years. To this end, we should also prepare a
                            three-five year <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program for Pakistan
                            for use if and when the timing seems ripe. We've been planning on around
                            $40 million annually in continuing <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.
                            As with India, we would also attach conditions <pb n="699"
                                xml:id="pg_699" facs="0725"/>to this program, particularly that it
                            is predicated upon our clear understanding that Pakistan will not go too
                            far with China.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately Chou En-lai's coming visit to Pakistan leads me to believe
                            that now is the wrong time to talk with <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"

                            another look at the whole problem of containing Communist aggression on
                            the subcontinent. Since Pakistan sees its so far limited relations with
                            Communist China as serving its national interest, just as India sees
                            relations with the U.S.S.R. as serving its interests, it is perhaps too
                            much to hope that we can develop unlimited security relationships with
                            either country. Yet if we can move ahead, albeit somewhat jerkily in
                            each country, I believe these proposals for military assistance to India
                            and Pakistan will advance our strategic objective of resisting Communist
                            pressure in the area without placing intolerable strains on our
                            relations with either country. Moreover, the course we propose, though
                            not ideal, seems best calculated to reduce the possibility that the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute will be fought out in the subcontinent.</p>

                    <p>We have concluded that in the future Indo-Pakistan relations will be tense

                        <p>Over the last year the external pressures upon India and Pakistan, at a
                            time when both governments are in a relatively weaker internal position,
                            have resulted in a hardening of the position of each country toward the
                            other and a consequent exacerbation of tensions, exemplified in the
                            following:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">1. Recent Pakistan Actions</hi></p>
                        <p>Pakistan has used all media and available opportunities (bilateral
                            discussions, <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> meetings, U.N., etc.) to emphasize
                            its fear of India and conviction that a militarily strengthened India
                            will be aggressive. In October the Pakistan Government mounted a
                            sustained propaganda and diplomatic campaign charging India with
                            misusing western arms assistance and taking actions in Kashmir which are
                            contrary to U.N. resolutions. On the diplomatic level Pakistan delivered
                            a series of aide-memoire to us and the U.K., exchanged bitterly worded
                            notes with India and lodged letters of protest with the U.N. A virulent
                            anti-Indian press campaign and vitriolic statements by Pakistan leaders
                            supported the diplomatic moves. The principal thesis of these efforts
                            was that India's actions had proven Pakistan's contention about Indian
                            aggressive intentions. Also, we have received intelligence reports which
                            indicated that Pakistan was considering causing trouble of some sort
                            along the Kashmir border or within Kashmir. In the last few weeks there
                            has been a decrease of overt indicators of immediate trouble in Kashmir,
                            although the Pakistan press has periodically returned to the attack.
                            Also, we continue to receive reports of the distribution of arms to
                            civilians in the cease-fire line area. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName>, who was out of the country in
                            October, has informed us that he is strongly opposed to the current
                            tactics of the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and would exercise
                            his influence to prevent extreme reaction to inconsequential Indian
                            “provocations.”</p>

                        <p>More recently Pakistan has requested India to close a branch office of
                            the Indian Deputy High Commission in East Pakistan charging it was used
                            for subversive activities. This policy toward India has been accompanied
                            by a continuing series of steps to normalize Pakistan's relations with
                            Communist China, India's enemy. Most recently, Pakistan has agreed to a
                            state visit by Chou En-lai and Chen Yi in February 1964.</p>

                        <p><persName>Nehru</persName>'s Lok Sabha speech on Kashmir in August
                            withdrew the “concessions” offered during the earlier bilateral talks
                            and virtually slammed the door on third party mediation.</p>
                        <p>On October 4, 1963 the outgoing Prime Minister of India-held Kashmir,
                            Ghulam Bakshi, made certain proposals which, if adopted, would
                            constitute further steps toward the integration of Kashmir into the
                            Indian Union. While the Bakshi proposals thus far have not been
                            implemented, an action of this nature is a red flag to Pakistanis and
                            was the immediate stimulant for the Pakistani campaign. Later in the
                            month the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> replied to a Pakistan note
                            of protest in a particularly insulting manner and a letter to the U.N.
                            Security Council was provocative. The Indian press did not reach the
                            high pitch of the Pakistan press but it did add to the over-all tense
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>On November 27, Home Minister Nanda told Parliament that Kashmir was
                            “fully integrated” into India and, that while there was no present
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> intention to repeal Article 370
                            of the Indian Constitution which accords a special status to Kashmir,
                            Nanda indicated that Article 370 undoubtedly would be further diluted by
                            additional changes in consultation with the Kashmir government. He
                            indicated that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> approved the
                            nomenclature changes proposed by Bakshi on October 4. Supplementing
                            Nanda's remarks, <persName>Nehru</persName> told Parliament November 27
                            that the “process of gradual erosion of Article 370 is going on” and
                            should be allowed to continue.</p>
                        <p>India has continued to expel sizeable numbers of Muslims from Assam and
                            Tripura into East Pakistan and has taken a hard line on negotiations
                            with Pakistan on this problem. However, on November 13 Home Minister
                            Nanda announced that special judicial tribunals were being formed to
                            review expulsion cases to assure that no errors were made. Moreover,
                            agreement reportedly has been reached with Pakistan for diplomatic and
                            ministerial talks on the Muslim evacuee problem. This may be jeopardized
                            by Pakistan's action to close India's branch office in East
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>During recent conversations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                                >Bowles</persName>, Indian leaders have stated that India will
                            follow a policy of restraint in its relations with Pakistan. Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> has reiterated this
                            assurance in his <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0730"/>recent letter
                            to the President.<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">See <ref target="#d336"
                                    >Document 336</ref>.</note> In addition, Indian officials both
                            in New Delhi and Washington have informed us that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be pleased if the United States
                            repeated its security assurances to Pakistan regarding aggression by
                            India. The Indians state that they hope and assume that this would have
                            a quieting effect on the Pakistanis.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. U.S. and U.K. Response</hi></p>
                        <p>In Washington and in Karachi and New Delhi, we have urged both India and
                            Pakistan to act with restraint, to avoid provocative actions, and to
                            make full use of the U.N. Observers in Kashmir if trouble ensued. We
                            also informed the governments that our position on the Bakshi
                            integration proposals is governed by the U.N. Security Council
                            resolutions. With respect to the Pakistani charges of Indian misuse of
                            western military aid, we have intentionally refrained from making any
                            formal reply to Pakistan so as not to encourage spurious charges, but we
                            have quietly urged the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to take great
                            care that equipment is not misdirected to units facing Pakistan. We have
                            closely coordinated the substance of our response with the U.K. which in
                            London and in Karachi and New Delhi has followed a parallel line. The
                            British have emphasized to Pakistan that provocative acts on its part
                            could undermine Pakistan's legal position on Kashmir.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">C. U.N. Observer Group Action</hi></p>
                        <p>General Nimmo, the head of the U.N. Military Observer Group in Kashmir,
                            has reported that there has been a substantial increase in incidents in
                            the last eighteen months and he has requested six additional military
                            officers to bolster his current force of 34 people. Although the U.N.
                            Secretariat has for several months been attempting to find a replacement
                            for the DC-3 transport aircraft previously furnished the Group by the
                            Italian Government, General Nimmo has recently expressed interest in
                            obtaining instead smaller aircraft or helicopters to increase the
                            observation capability of the Group. We have asked our Mission in New
                            York to consult informally with the Secretariat to obtain the latter's
                            clarification of its requirements so that we may explore ways we and
                            others might assist to resolve this question.</p>

                                difficult to determine the relative weight of each factor. We agree

                                India, that the Kashmir issue is not dormant, and that Pakistan has

                            <item>Pakistan's actions are also indicative of its basic attitude, or

                                against Afghanistan during 1961-1963 and has always been applied in
                                cycles to India. As <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> puts
                                it, Pakistan's policy is to “lean against India.” At the same time
                                Pakistan is seeking to enlist on its side the power of other
                                nations, particularly the United States, but also including
                                Communist China, to bring pressure to bear on India to resolve the

                        <p>The Indian Government is determined to avoid an appearance of weakness
                            vis-a-vis Pakistan. Many influential Indians suspect that Pakistan has
                            secret agreements with Communist China and are fearful of coordinated
                            pressure against India. Consequently, India is not disposed to negotiate
                            or to be forthcoming with Pakistan. The Indian assessment of the October
                            tension was mixed. Moreover, as is the case in Pakistan, the <gloss

                            demonstrate its ability to be firm with Pakistan. The official Indian
                            position has been that the Pakistanis were playing to the gallery in
                            preparation for General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                            visit and that India's best course was to ignore or play down Pakistani
                            protests and act with restraint. A second viewpoint within the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was that the Pakistanis might well
                            cross the ceasefire line in order to dramatize the Kashmir issue with a

                    <p>At own request Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NBK1">Nehru</persName> called
                        on Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> December 18.
                        Ambassador said purpose was to obtain up-to-date reading Administration's
                        thinking prior return to India for consultations. Principal topics of
                        conversation relating to India were Indian Ocean Naval Task Group and
                        longer-term military aid. (Ambassador also <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707"
                            facs="0733"/>inquired about situation in Cambodia and Viet Nam. This
                        being reported separately.)</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean Naval Task Group:</hi> Ambassador said his
                        reports from Delhi indicate General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> “went slow” on Indian Ocean Task Group, probably due
                        situation created by press leak; Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1"
                            >Nehru</persName> “heard him out” and later made statement in Parliament
                        giving Indian position. Ambassador asked what is concept behind Task
                        Group—to link up Seventh Fleet with Mediterranean? Is concept more
                        psychological than military? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        replied Task Group would make forces available in Indian Ocean area in case
                        of need, and give sense of US presence for defense of subcontinent which
                        could contribute to its security. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> emphasized that US not asking for bases. Ambassador
                        suggested matter be kept at technical level and political aspects be played
                        in low key. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed on low
                        key approach and repeated US intention work things out through
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Longer-Term Military Aid:</hi> Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said US has under consideration
                        longer-term military assistance to India. To make decisions we need more
                        information about Indian plans on force levels; on diversion of resources
                        from economic development; and “pretty definite” understanding regarding
                        limitation of arms procurement from Soviets. Ambassador interrupted to ask
                        what kind of understanding we had in mind. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> said US could not work out longer-run aid for India if
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would go around shopping in <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Ambassador asked if US would object to
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> getting Soviet arms as part of
                        over-all plan on scope of Indian requirements and build-up. In such plan, US
                        and Soviets each might supply some of what <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> unable achieve from own resources. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that in view Congressional
                        attitudes, for US to undertake longer-term assistance we would feel our aid
                        should be “fairly exclusive,” Ambassador asked why. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied there is difference between
                        Soviet economic aid and military aid. Latter involves question of our
                        security requirements and could establish relationship of Indian dependence
                        on Soviets in military matters. Ambassador asked if General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had discussed this. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> would discuss it and added that
                        this question subject to further discussion.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador said that Indian viewpoint would be to have a plan and to fill in
                        gaps caused by limitation Indian resources where <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> could. Ambassador then said he understands US has two
                        objections to Soviet arms aid: possible security compromise, and political
                        objections. He said security problems could be overcome. Ambassador then
                        cited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s statement that
                        military assistance entails dependence and asked if US wants India to be
                        dependent exclusively on US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                        replied there is question of degree and this matter can be discussed
                        further. He said US also needs more indication of India's plans to keep
                        tensions <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0734"/>down with Pakistan, in
                        view of effect our arms aid on US as well as Indian relations with <gloss
                            target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>Earlier in conversation Ambassador had expressed inability understand why
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s stirring up trouble with India. In
                        response question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> expressed
                        belief that <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> relations with Chicoms would
                        remain “formalistic” and not develop into “something serious.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador turned to US rationale for arms aid to India if US assessment is
                        that <gloss target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss> won't attack. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we do not believe <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s presently intend to attack again but
                        we can't be sure about future. It is important for us that India not have to
                        live in fear of an attack and that India be in position to meet attack if
                        one develops in next few years. This does not mean we think India should
                        have excessive military establishment and it important not to disrupt
                        economic development.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador said he had no disagreement with this in principle. He also said
                        that a defense plan which US might aid would have to be one of agreed
                        magnitude. However, Ambassador said he foresaw “great difficulty” on the
                        other two “conditions” (i.e. understanding re limitation arms procurement
                        from Soviets and understanding re Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        relations). Ambassador then asked about the other “condition” he has heard,
                        namely <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> undertaking security
                        responsibilities in Southeast Asia. In response Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said this not priority matter;
                        stressed India needs to concentrate on own immediate problems. Ambassador
                        next raised question of Sino-Soviet rift and after brief exchange of views
                        suggested that Western actions could have important effect on rift. As he
                        was departing <persName>Nehru</persName> said US insistence on exclusive
                        Indian dependence on US arms, combined with placing India under protection
                        7th fleet, could have considerable effect on Soviet by seeming to place
                        India in position of fearing attack from Soviets as well as from <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. This could affect Soviet policy
                        toward India and toward Sino-Soviet rift by tending push Soviets and <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s closer together.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visited Pakistan December
                        19-20. A brief initial meeting between <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> at
                        8:15 a.m. on December 20 was reported in telegram 1188 from Karachi,
                        December 21. (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>After opening amenities, President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> in response to an invitation from General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to give his general assessment of
                        the security situation in the subcontinent, stated that he was bound to put
                        forward the view that security interests of Pakistan had been seriously
                        prejudiced by US military assistance to India. Vital interests of Pakistan
                        had been placed in jeopardy. There was no telling what India would do with
                        the added capability given her by the United States. He thought India would
                        use the vast additional military strength to intimidate her smaller
                        neighbors. The strength would not be used against the Chinese Communists.
                        The Indians knew they could not challenge Communist China and they would in
                        time seek an accommodation with the Chinese Communists. From the standpoint
                        of India's own selfish interests, the augmented military program was a
                        mistake. Indian military expenses rose about 300 per cent in the years just
                        before the attack in 1962, and had risen another 300 per cent since then.
                        This was a very heavy burden on the Indian people.</p>
                    <p>The US policy toward India had placed Pakistan in a “terrible predicament.”
                        Pakistan was torn between her sense of loyalty to the United States as an
                        ally and the need to look after Pakistan's security interests which had been
                        hurt by US action.</p>
                    <p>In response to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>'s
                        observation that there should be no incompatibility between national
                        security and loyalty to an ally, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        agreed that this should be so. But he felt that Pakistan's security
                        interests had been disregarded. The U.S. “held Pakistan's interests too
                        cheap.” It seemed that Pakistan's security was considered an expendable
                        commodity <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0736"/>if it conflicted with
                        other concerns of the United States. He thought that “wittingly or
                        unwittingly,” the U.S. was building up the enemy of Pakistan. This was hard
                        to reconcile with the status of uniquely close friendship which has happily
                        prevailed between the United States and Pakistan. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> assured us that “we will fight for
                        this land of ours.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> indicated that he could
                        not figure out why we had not required the Indians to come to a clear
                        understanding with us on the nature of the commitments she would assume in
                        return for the US aid she would receive. He thought India was assuming
                        commitments against the Chinese which she could not and would not discharge,
                        and was refusing to make collective security commitments to participate in
                        the common defense which she could make and should be required to make.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said it was self evident
                        that the security objectives which presumably underlay our policy of
                        assistance to India could not be achieved without a settlement between India
                        and Pakistan, because the subcontinent was not defensible without the
                        cooperation of India and Pakistan. Therefore, our Indian policy was self
                        defeating unless we made an Indo-<gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>
                        settlement a condition precedent.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said it was the considered
                        conclusion of the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> that there would not
                        be any Sino-Indian conflict. Tibet was not a feasible base for Chinese
                        aggression across the Himalayas. He predicted that India would in time work
                        out an accommodation with Communist China and then proceed to expel US
                        influence from South Asia. He prophesied that the Indians would agree on
                        “spheres of influence” with the Chinese. The Indians wanted only the “Indian
                        Ocean littoral” and would leave Southeast Asia and the rest to Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The Indians would then be free to settle by force with Pakistan, using force
                        in the same way that she has invoked force in the past. He recalled that
                        India had already forced two mobilizations by Pakistan.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> recognized that American
                        assistance was not the only important contribution to the armament of India
                        but he said that American aid was providing the decisive margin. And aid was
                        the unsettling factor which was undermining the stability of the area. He
                        said “only the Communists will benefit.” He said that all the peripheral
                        small countries around India were disillusioned to see “US policy coinciding
                        with India's.” They would feel compelled to turn to Communist China to seek
                        a counterweight against a stronger India which could not be trusted. He said
                        that “sometimes in a bad situation it is necessary to lie down with the
                        Devil.” Commenting on General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                        >Taylor</persName>'s remark that it was risky business to associate with the
                        Devil, <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said sometimes it was
                        necessary to decide which was the lesser of two Devils.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> insisted that the U.S.
                        could not rely on Indian collaboration. He reiterated that India would
                        eventually liquidate the US position in this area and accommodate with the
                        Communists. The Pakistanis <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0737"/>knew the
                        Indians. Their positive prediction should be heeded. He recalled that
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> has consistently sided with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Communist Bloc against the U.S.
                        and he will surely revert to this position. <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> urged that the U.S. should support the smaller
                        countries of South Asia. This was the natural course for the U.S. to follow
                        in preserving a stable balance. All three of the big countries of the area
                        (China, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and India) were expansionist
                        and it was disastrous for the U.S. to support any of them against the small
                        countries. It forced the small countries to follow an unnatural course in
                        trying to play one of the big Asian countries off against another as a means
                        of self preservation. The Indians were not genuine allies of the U.S. and
                        the U.S. is making a serious mistake to regard them as allies.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that the people of Pakistan
                        are completely baffled at the American policy of military aid to India.
                        Everyone asks “Why?” and there is no good answer. The issue has made the
                        life of every Pakistani miserable and the policy seems so clearly mistaken
                        that Pakistanis keep looking for a deeper design not apparent to them. The
                        President ended by saying, “We are in a fix. We have never had such a deep
                        and close relationship as we have had with the U.S. and we want to continue
                        to be your friends.” He implied that the creation of a deep sense of fear
                        and insecurity in Pakistan was not consistent with friendship.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> expressed his
                        appreciation for the opportunity of hearing firsthand a complete exposition
                        of the President's views. He mentioned that the U.S. and the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> evaluations of Chinese Communist
                        capabilities against the subcontinent were about the same. However, we
                        differed on the strength of defense forces needed by India as a deterrent.
                        The figures which the Pakistan Service Chiefs had given him in an earlier
                        meeting were somewhat lower than ours. He mentioned the state of shock which
                        prevailed in the Indian Defence establishment right after the Chinese attack
                        in late 1962 and the process of adjustment to more realistic planning
                        objectives that had occurred since that time. He stressed the need for
                        economic stability in India and assured the President that we did not have
                        in mind any Indian military program which would destroy economic
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>The defense program that the Indians are shaping up does not seem entirely
                        unreasonable although it is somewhat higher than our estimate of force
                        requirements. The Indians seem to be talking frankly to us on their defense
                        objectives. Possibly they are hoodwinking us, but, if so, we have good
                        checks which will soon reveal to us just what they are doing. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mentioned the force goals
                        of Indian Army and Air Force and the problem of funding. He thought that
                        funding problems would be an automatic and effective brake on any
                        unwarranted Indian military expansion. The Finance Minister did not intend
                        to allow defense expenditures to exceed the current rate of 5 to 6% of the
                        G.N.P. He also was planning <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0738"/>to
                        reduce the foreign exchange drain caused by military procurement by 50 per
                        cent. It was recently $235 million a year and he expected to cut it to $125
                        million. The British were not expected to make any major arms contribution.
                        And the amount of aid to be received from the Soviet Union was highly
                        problematical. The Soviets were evasive in what they would do. Considering
                        the heavy Soviet obligations in Indonesia and Cuba it was doubtful if they
                        had any large stocks available for supply to India. A runaway program seemed
                        definitely unlikely. The U.S. would not underwrite the Indian deficit. Thus
                        the economic factor would be the ultimate brake on the armament program.</p>
                    <p>In answer to a question from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        about the magnitude of the US military assistance program for India, General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> thought it would run
                        about $50 million this year. In answer to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName>'s further question, he confirmed that this would be in
                        addition to the Nassau Program of $60 million. In response to a further
                        question from <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> as to whether aid
                        might be expected to continue at a figure more or less in this same range,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said no one could
                        tell how much the US Congress would appropriate. Within the Executive
                        Branch, the feeling was that a figure somewhere in this range was about
                        right if Indian behavior should be right. We thought it would be worth that
                        amount to help save a great nation from the Chinese Communist grip. The
                        question had been carefully thought over for a long time and if India kept
                        herself well detached from the Soviet Union and assumed some responsibility
                        for the defense of the Free World countries facing China, the effort to help
                        her would be worthwhile. The U.S. considered it essential to stop Chinese
                        Communist expansionism in China's southern flank as well as in the Far East.
                        The holding action on the flank involved both India and Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> referred to some
                        possibilities mentioned by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                            >Ball</persName> on his visit last September and said we would like to
                        inquire further into the possibility of the U.S. contributing something
                        additional to Pakistan's sense of security. We would like to demonstrate our
                        determination and capability to assist Pakistan's defense in case of
                        necessity. He mentioned our efforts to capitalize on the principle of
                        strategic mobility. He said we were prepared to talk with the Pakistanis
                        about bringing in Army and Air Force elements for experimental exercises. He
                        also mentioned the prospect of an Indian Ocean Task Force which would afford
                        additional sea and air protection. He spelled out in general terms our
                        preliminary concept for the presence of the task force from the Seventh
                        Fleet consisting of a carrier, two or three destroyers, and a fleet oiler,
                        in Indian Ocean waters.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that this type of
                        assistance was of value only if it were utilized in accordance with a
                        military plan. Pakistan knew the high physical capacity of the US forces but
                        the question had to be answered, “what do they come for?” General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said we did not know for sure <pb
                            n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0739"/>what the time factors would be in
                        actual practice. We could compute them on a slide rule but we wanted to
                        verify the calculations with actual exercises.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought it would be
                        “just a gimmick” unless it was for a definite purpose—in support of a
                        certain plan.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that a certain
                        type of operational planning could be engaged in—planning on how to join up
                        US forces with the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s and make the best
                        use of them on any frontier—North, South, East or West—without concentrating
                        attention exclusively on any one. Naturally, we would not want it known that
                        any planning against India was contemplated. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> agreed that it was not necessary to
                        orient the planning to one direction. All contingencies should be
                        considered. Details could be deferred but “some discussion would be
                        necessary.” He said that Pakistan would be agreeable to keeping all planning
                        highly classified.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> thought that various
                        aspects of planning could be accommodated as an outgrowth of the basic
                        exercise. If it was assumed that US forces were positioned initially in a
                        central area, several alternative plans could be worked out for theoretical
                        movement of the troops to different fronts.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> asked if we could
                        proceed with planning on that basis. With some preplanning the presence of
                        mobile forces could be made effective and decisive.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said it would have to
                        be understood there would be no overt assumption of use of forces against
                        India.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> readily agreed. He
                        observed that there also could be a Soviet threat—from Afghanistan or even
                        from Iran. The various contingencies should be considered.</p>
                    <p>General Goodpaster mentioned the recent US exercise in Germany where troops
                        were flown in, married up with prepositioned equipment, and exercised in
                        accordance with a plan for an appropriate field operation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> agreed that previous planning and
                        prepositioning were useful.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said there was in
                        progress a world-wide study of prepositioning requirements. The earlier
                        prepositioning in Germany was on the ground, but in the Philippines there
                        was experimentation with the positioning of materiel in ships.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said, “we can think
                        further of that.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> then reverted to the
                        Indian question and predicted that the US-Indian policy would create
                        problems for the U.S. He understood U.S. reluctance to take measures which
                        would seem aimed at India. It would not make any sense for us to take direct
                        measures to curb <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0740"/>Indian misuse of
                        her arms capability, at the same time we were building up that capability.
                        He regretted that our influence had not been used in India to force a
                        solution of the disruptive issues. He said that “India would not sit still”
                        after her military capacity was built up.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question from General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> about why Pakistan had strong reservations about US
                        assurances to Pakistan covering the contingency of Indian aggression,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said the U.S. might not be
                        able to come to Pakistan's assistance promptly. The good intention of the
                        United States was not doubted. But the world situation and US global
                        responsibilities might make it difficult even if the case were clear. The
                        President observed that Pakistan could do the defense job for herself with
                        proper modern equipment. Pakistan did not want to embarrass the United
                        States or call on the U.S. to fight Pakistan's battles. He said Pakistan
                        could perform the defense task “more cheaply.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mentioned the
                        unfavorable geographical position in which Pakistan had been placed by fate.
                        He thought that with potential military threats on several fronts, some
                        reliance on US help was unavoidable.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said Pakistan must be
                        able to take the first shock of an Indian attack. He stated, “the strategic
                        defense of East Pakistan lies in West Pakistan.” He thought that the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> could hold in West Pakistan for a while.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> affirmed that the
                        United States wanted to keep Pakistan strong and its fighting forces tough
                        so that they could have a considerable measure of reliance in
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said that the Pakistan
                        forces needed something more in hand than they now have. He said if East
                        Pakistan should be attacked “we go as hard as we can.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said in an ideal world
                        there would be a unified defense of Pakistan and India.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> agreed, but said any
                        such idea had to be dismissed. He had offered joint defense to
                            <persName>Nehru</persName> four years ago and had got nowhere with that
                        offer or any other attempt to cooperate. The Indians were completely
                        negative and could not be brought to see the common interest.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> referred to the press
                        reports of the proposal of an Indian Ocean Task Force and said he would tell
                        us in all frankness that the political reaction to the reports was very
                        adverse so far in African and Asian countries. It was interpreted as a
                        reversion to “Gunboat Diplomacy.” It was thought of as a modern version of
                        “teaching the natives and the heathen to behave.” He said the task force
                        would be too far away to hurt or restrain Communist China. The task forces
                        of the Seventh Fleet in Korean and Formosan waters were much closer to
                        China. He had enough preliminary reaction from African and Asian countries
                        to know the idea as it had leaked out in the press was not good. It had had
                        a bad <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0741"/>reception politically. He was
                        “not in the know” but he had misgivings from this standpoint.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if the reaction
                        would be different if the task force were linked up with <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss> responsibilities.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought the “auspices” were
                        important and that a collective security mantle would be an improvement.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mentioned that the
                        task force could operate in any context in fulfillment of <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>, or bilateral obligations.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that the defense problems
                        in the Middle East and the subcontinent were essential land-air problems,
                        not naval.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> noted that a carrier
                        would provide a useful mobile airfield.</p>
                    <p>General Goodpaster observed that the task force would give us a better
                        capability for backstopping our friends and carrying out our bilateral
                        obligations.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that with the
                        remarkable jet air transport facilities the U.S. enjoyed, the Pacific was
                        quite close and it would not take long for assistance to come from the Far
                        East.</p>
                    <p>General Goodpaster mentioned the CASF groups in several sizes which are
                        highly mobile and can close in on a given area within 48 to 72 hours.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought the task force
                        was not the right sort of back-up for what we had in mind. He thought we
                        needed staff talks on “what?” and “where?” If there was going to be a task
                        force it needed the right sort of collective auspices. If the thing had been
                        announced in a different way it could have been dovetailed with something
                        acceptable. He thought it was unfortunate the way it had leaked.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> thought the question
                        could be discussed in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> councils.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought it would be a
                        good thing to have discussions there.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said the
                        Ceylonese leaders talked to President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1"
                            >Ayub</persName> and him last week in the course of the official
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> visit to Ceylon. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said the Ceylonese were quite
                        concerned when the leak came out. The Ceylonese were worried about the
                        nuclear weapons aspect, remarking that the Indian Ocean was free of the
                        nuclear threat until this matter came up. They thought the task force would
                        bring the confrontation of the great powers much closer to the Indian Ocean
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> then asked if
                        we were consulting our allies first on the task force matters. He was
                        assured that this was the case and that the reports to the effect that we
                        had consulted the Indians closely on the matter over a long period of time
                        were entirely without foundation in fact.</p>
                    <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0742"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> answered a
                        question as to whether TTK and other Indian leaders had not been informed
                        about the matter a long time ago, by stating categorically that no Indians
                        had been consulted or informed about the matter until General <persName
                            corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> did so earlier this week. He said
                        he had already informed the Foreign Secretary to this effect earlier in the
                        week.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said he still thought
                        the task force proposal as it now stands is “a gimmick.”</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> said that every
                        country must be able to count on its own defense forces and have its own
                        independent sense of security if it is to maintain its self-respect and its
                        integrity.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that no
                        country in the present-day world could rely entirely on its own resources,
                        not even the United States.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                            >Bhutto</persName> agreed that this was so and indicated that they had
                        in mind more an initial holding capability so that the first shock could be
                        absorbed. General Musa added that Pakistan badly needed equipment in order
                        to prevent the heart of the country from being pierced during an initial
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> confirmed specifically
                        in answer to a question from General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                            >Taylor</persName> that Pakistan did not want to enlarge its army or add
                        greatly to the quantity of its equipment. The aim was to modernize.
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> recognized that the United
                        States would not want to negate its aid to India by automatically offsetting
                        it in Pakistan. But he said that inevitably “you are involved on both sides
                        under your present policy.” <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        thought that if war should break out between India and Pakistan it would be
                        bound to spread. It could not be kept localized.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mentioned the U.S.
                        conviction that the probability of Indian aggression was very low.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> thought that Indian
                        intentions could change very rapidly when its capability changed. He thought
                        that 1,000 years of history and antagonism could not be ignored.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> recalled
                        earlier statements of President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>
                        that the Pakistanis could hold the Indians in case of an attack and
                        administer them a lesson which the Indians would not forget.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> said the Pakistani
                        resolve would remain the same but better quality of arms was needed to
                        maintain the traditional ratio between the two countries. Pakistan would
                        continue to rely on better skill, superior leadership, better fighting
                        manpower and highly mobile equipment, “then India would not go off the deep
                        end.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mentioned that we have
                        got economic strings on India. The economic sanctions we could apply would
                        in themselves be a strong deterrent to aggressive action.</p>
                    <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0743"/>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> felt that various
                        policy making elements in Washington “still bend over backwards to appease
                        the Indians.” He said that <persName>Nehru</persName> consistently blackens
                        the US reputation but seems to get more consideration from us the worse he
                        acts. He said “it makes us sick to see how it goes.”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> mentioned with apparent
                        approval a recent remark he attributed to an American caller to the effect
                        that the U.S. seems to apply reverse order of priority in the consideration
                        it shows to other countries. He said it seems that Communist countries get
                        the most attention, then the neutralist countries, and finally the friends
                        and allies—if anything is left.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> smiled at this but
                        noted that we could not limit our help only to those who speak well of us.
                        We would not do much helping if we confined ourselves to those who did not
                        criticize us or follow policies divergent from ours. It was increasingly
                        difficult to please all recipients of our aid.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> asked us to bear in mind that
                        India had no interest in working with us in a security sense, once she is
                        out of the China difficulty. “India will never be a security fortress.”
                        General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that India
                        would probably never be any great reinforcement to the Free World in a
                        military sense, but he thought that politically and socially, India might
                        become an asset. If it could be made into a good example of a going
                        democratic nation, this would be a great development.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> noted that a year ago
                        we had the Indians where we should have wanted them. We could have asked
                        them to behave at that time, and they would have been bound to comply. They
                        could not have turned their backs on the U.S. and turned to the Russians
                        because the Russians would not pay. The opportunity passed quickly when we
                        did not seize it and the present situation also is transitory. There is no
                        solidarity in present US relationship with India.</p>
                    <p>(At this point the group adjourned for lunch with the President. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stayed on for a few words
                        alone with the President.)</p>

                        <item>At my request I had a 30-minute private discussion with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> at the close of the
                            meeting which included Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                                >Bhutto</persName>, Defense Secretary <persName>Ahmed</persName>,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>, and
                            General Goodpaster. I opened by saying that I wanted, as a long time
                            friend of Pakistan and of its President, to express my deep regret over
                            the apparent downward trend in <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>/US
                            relationships over the past year. As an outgrowth of the frank
                            discussions just completed, could we not accept the existence of an
                            honest difference of view as to the rightness of US military aid to
                            India, cease the recriminations which have been souring our relations
                            and move forward together toward common objectives? On the US side we
                            have no reason to apologize for our course of action. The decision has
                            been taken after careful thought and close attention to the views of the
                            Pakistan government.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>I stated that on our side we felt that we should put aside the
                            discussion of past disagreements despite the fact that the coming visit
                            of Chou En-lai to Karachi has created for us a domestic problem for the
                            immediate future. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> made this point clear to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZA1">Bhutto</persName> during his recent
                            visit to Washington, particularly with respect to the impact of the
                            visit on Congressional relations. Right now Congress is in an unfriendly
                            mood toward all foreign aid and could well use the discord in South Asia
                            as a reason to reduce or eliminate aid to both Pakistan and
                            India.</item>

                            forcefully that he “loved President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                >Johnson</persName> more than a brother” and that he wanted me to
                            report to him the true facts with regard to <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                                >Pak</gloss> relations to Red China and the circumstances of the
                            Chou En-lai visit. With regard to <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss>/Chinese relations, the US could hardly quarrel with his
                            desire to normalize relations with one of his potential enemies and thus
                            limit his military stakes. After all, the US maintains relations with

                        <item>I interposed that we received them correctly but did not embrace them.
                            The Chou En-lai visit appears to be a matter of another kind. <persName

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> argued heatedly that his
                            motive should not be misunderstood. For him to be on terms with Chou
                            En-lai was a service to the West. He could learn something of Chinese
                            intentions and discover in time any move by the Indians to seek
                            accommodation with Peking—a move he is sure the Indians will eventually
                            make. During the visit, he will be able to talk over important matters
                            with Chou En-lai and turn the attacks which his visitor is sure to make
                            on the US.</item>

                        <item><persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> indicated that he too had
                            a domestic problem resulting from US aid to India. His people simply did
                            not understand what the US meant by helping their enemies. I suggested
                            that the kind of joint exercise we had mentioned should have the effect
                            of reassuring his people about US capability and intention to come to
                            the aid of Pakistan. Also Pakistan leadership could help by interpreting
                            the true situation in statements to the public.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>He picked up the reference to the joint exercise and after some
                            discussion agreed that I should draw up a proposed scenario for the
                            exercise and send it to him for consideration, possibly by way of
                            General Adams. I felt that he was wary of the exercise as well as of the
                            Indian Ocean Task Force, probably sensing the possibility that a
                            successful reinforcement exercise could be used at some future time as a
                            reason to curtail military aid to Pakistan.</item>

                                    which will increase manpower requirement to 866,000.</item>

                                    squadrons, although status of approval at governmental level is
                                    not clear. Several senior officials indicated that an approved
                                    program has not yet been established, but expect it to be soon.
                                    The 45 squadron force was stated by Engineer to consist of 25
                                    fighter, 4 fighter/recon, 12 transport, 3 bomber and 1

                    <p>As a result of my recent visits to India and Pakistan and the conferences
                        reported in the referenced documents above, I have reached the following
                        conclusions and have formulated certain recommendations relating to the next
                        steps for military aid to these two countries. In effect, they represent
                        suggested modifications and extensions of reference a.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">I. INDIA</hi></p>
                    <p>1. I am in agreement with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                            >Bowles</persName> that it is time to develop a five-year military
                        assistance plan with India provided the Indians will (a) limit their force
                        goals, (b) hold down procurement from the Soviet Bloc, (c) hold to a minimum
                        diversion of foreign exchange from economic development, (d) exercise
                        restraint in relations with Pakistan, and (e) cooperate with us in the
                        containment of Communist China. I would go about assuring the attainment of
                        these five conditions not by negotiating them with the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> but through encouraging the development of
                        a five-year plan by the Indians which if put into effect would assure
                        meeting the first three provisos. Conditions (c) and (d) would remain a
                        continuing background requirement for cooperation with India in both the
                        economic and the military fields.</p>
                    <p>2. If my information is correct, there is at the present time no
                        interdepartmental plan in the Indian government which establishes a balanced
                        relationship between the economic and military programs of the <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. In the case of the military program, there
                        are as yet no agreed time-phased levels of force goals, no plan for the
                        allocation of available or anticipated resources to the needs of the three
                        services, and no determination of the kind and extent of foreign aid needed
                        to augment domestic resources.</p>
                    <p>3. It would be a service to the Indian government as well as in our own
                        interest to press for governmental planning to remedy these deficiencies <pb
                            n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0750"/>as a precondition to a discussion
                        of long-term aid in the specific terms of dollar levels, numbers and types
                        of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> supported units, the provision of
                        advanced equipment, and similar matters. A five-year plan would have the
                        advantage of obliging the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to face the
                        economic facts of life and of reinforcing the hand of the civilian leaders
                        who appear genuinely interested in preserving the economic program from
                        excesses in the field of rearmament.</p>
                    <p>4. The kind of five-year military program which we should seek would include
                        the following features: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>5. If the Indians are capable of producing such a plan with or without our
                        help, it would allow us to verify their intentions as to force goals, Soviet
                        procurement and the diversion of foreign exchange from economic developments
                        (conditions (a), (b), and (c) of paragraph 1 above). By this device, we
                        could hope to avoid arguments with them over force goals, always a source of
                        irritation, and would force the Indians to decide for themselves between the
                        competing needs of their economy and of their own services. The US position
                        would be strengthened vis-a-vis our own Congress by putting us in a position
                        to explain our aid in terms of a coherent Indian program.</p>
                    <p>6. To make such a plan a precondition for long-term aid injects an
                        undesirable time factor. Even if the Indians accept our help in developing
                        such a plan, it will take time to draft one. To bridge the time gap, we
                        would be justified in offering an interim one-year program of about $50
                        million providing for the Army continued support of the mountain division
                        program, of improved logistics for the forces along the Chinese border, and
                        of better intelligence efforts oriented toward China north of the frontier.
                        For the Air Force, in the interim program we should continue to support
                        radar, communications and air transport.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendations—India</hi></p>
                    <p>7. It is recommended that the US indicate to the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                            >GOI</gloss> a willingness to embark on parallel military planning
                        provided that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> first produce a
                        satisfactory five-year plan for its military forces along the lines of
                        paragraph 4 above. Pending the completion of such a plan, the US would make
                        the interim offer suggested in paragraph 6 above. However, it should be
                        clearly intimated that we are not willing to go forward indefinitely <pb
                            n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0751"/>with military or economic aid
                        without a firm five-year military plan.</p>
                    <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">II. PAKISTAN</hi></p>
                    <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and his Chiefs of
                        Staff view West Pakistan as exposed to attack from Afghanistan, China, and
                        India; but of these potential enemies, in their opinion India is the prime
                        threat toward which the major defensive effort must be directed. This view
                        of the primacy of the Indian threat is reinforced by consideration of the
                        isolated situation of East Pakistan which, encircled by India, is virtually
                        indefensible by direct means.</p>
                    <p>2. Finding itself in such a disadvantageous strategic posture, Pakistan is
                        deeply and genuinely afraid of Indian aggression. Our US pledge to help the
                            <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> to resist such aggression is
                        politely noted but <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> and those
                        around him openly express their fear that US aid in a crisis would be
                        delayed by the possible ambiguities of the situation, by the delays or
                        hesitations inherent in the decision-making process of a democracy, or by
                        the distances to be traversed by our reinforcements. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> would say that these factors plus the
                        inexplicable action of the US in giving aid to India have caused an acute
                        uneasiness which obsesses his people.</p>
                    <p>3. With this view of the military situation of Pakistan, <persName
                            corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> appears to have set for himself
                        certain defense goals for his armed forces. The latter should have the
                        capability in themselves of deterring or checking an Indian attack against
                        West Pakistan. They should also be capable of deterring India from attacking
                        East Pakistan; but if deterrence fails, there is little likelihood of
                        checking an attack against this exclave. To effect deterrence, Pakistan
                        needs supersonic aircraft as a threat against Indian targets. With the
                        foregoing capabilities, the armed forces would have the visible strength
                        necessary to deter India, reassure the people and allay the current
                        fears.</p>
                    <p>4. It then becomes a question of how to obtain such forces. For this purpose
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> must have the US as an ally
                        willing to provide the essential military equipment. But our military aid to
                        India and our reluctance to meet his equipment needs to the extent desired
                        have led him to embark on a campaign of sharp criticism of US behavior
                        coupled with moves to “normalize” relations with Red China. Such moves
                        appear useful to him both in neutralizing an unfriendly neighbor and in
                        goading the US to pay greater attention to his needs. While the campaign is
                        in progress to get greater and more expeditious help out of the US,
                            <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName> can hardly be expected to
                        drop the quarrel with India or become enthusiastic over military exercises
                        which will demonstrate that the US forces are not as far away as he says.
                        But in spite of his strong objections to US help to India, I have the
                        feeling that while he is swallowing hard, it is going down.</p>
                    <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0752"/>
                    <p>5. In these circumstances, it is to the interest of the US to give due
                        recognition to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> case and strengthen
                            <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> confidence and good will without
                        appearing to succumb to querulous complaining. This purpose could best be
                        served by offering the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss>s US support
                        through a five-year military plan under essentially the same conditions as
                        the Indians. The goal of 5-1/2 modernized divisions for West Pakistan
                        remains valid. The provision of two more squadrons of supersonic aircraft
                        would add to <persName corresp="#p_AKM1">Ayub</persName>'s weapons of
                        deterrence against India and to the arsenal of <gloss target="#t_CENTO1"
                            >CENTO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. If, as it
                        appears, the Indians have made a deal with the Soviets for the purchase of
                        surface-to-air missiles, this decision on supersonic aircraft for Pakistan
                        becomes much easier. The foregoing offer should be conditioned on a
                        wholehearted change of attitude by the <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        toward <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                            >SEATO</gloss>, and the U.S.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendations—Pakistan</hi></p>
                    <p>6. It is recommended that, concurrently with the action toward India, the US
                        indicate to Pakistan its willingness to engage on parallel terms in
                        five-year military planning under similar assumptions of continued US aid.
                        This offer should include the provision of two additional squadrons of
                        supersonic aircraft. It should be contingent on continued fulfillment by
                        Pakistan of its obligations to <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss>, to
                            <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, and to the US. To demonstrate
                        to the <gloss target="#t_Pak1">Pak</gloss> public the availability of US
                        military support, we should seek <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                        concurrence in a joint mobility exercise involving the proposed Indian Ocean
                        Task Force.</p>

                        condition US military aid. We recognize that Indians may not exclude all
                        such Soviet aid. We do, however, proceed from assumption that US is clearly
                        the more reliable source of support to India against <gloss
                            target="#t_Chicom1">Chicom</gloss>s. Our specific judgment on
                        significance of Soviet military assistance would be determined by number of
                        factors including following: quantities and types of Soviet aid accepted,
                        effect on security US equipment, compatibility of differing types equipment,
                        extent to which Soviet assistance requires introduction Soviet technicians,
                        US Congressional attitudes, impact Soviet aid, and degree of Indian
                        dependence on Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_TP1">Talbot</persName>
                        concluded by saying he assumed Indians were examining implications of Soviet
                        aid along similar lines.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador recalled earlier US-Indian talks on implications Soviet military

                    <p>Between 1954, when this pact was finally signed, and the election of our
                        Democratic Administration in 1960, I wrote extensively and spoke in 43
                        states with this particular example of mistaken judgment by the Eisenhower
                        Administration as a major theme. May I add in all fairness that the bold
                        move by Herter and Dillon in 1958 to bolster India's economy in spite of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> was a major factor
                        in undoing some of the damage done by the <gloss target="#t_Pak1"
                            >Pak</gloss> “alliance.”</p>
                    <p>In October of 1962 we were suddenly confronted with the opportunity that many
                        of us had been hoping for—an overt Chinese Communist action which would
                        bring home to the Indian Government and people some primary facts of life of
                        Asian politics, i.e., the inevitable political-economic rivalry of China and
                        India and the danger an expansionist China holds for India not only along
                        the 2,200-mile Himalayan frontier but also in Southeast Asia which flanks
                        India's eastern approaches.</p>
                    <p>The Indians, who had refused substantial Soviet military aid in May 1950 and
                        again in February 1957, were wholly unprepared for the Chinese attack and
                        were, as you know, humiliatingly defeated. This situation forced the
                        resignation of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, threw
                        the Communist Party into disarray, knocked the Soviets off balance and
                        (following our prompt assistance) established the United States as India's
                        most reliable <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0755"/>friend with an
                        outpouring of public good will for our country which must be seen and felt
                        to be believed.</p>
                    <p>If the Pakistanis had seized on this opportunity to establish a better
                        relationship with India by a strong statement of support against China, or
                        at least a beneficent neutrality, a wholly new atmosphere would have been
                        created between Karachi and New Delhi in which some settlement of the
                        Kashmir quarrel might have been achieved. But Pakistan chose to endorse
                        China's border claim, assert that India had attacked China, and have Mao
                        Tse-tung as a friend. Five weeks from now Chou En-lai will be welcomed in
                        Karachi as a state guest.</p>
                    <p>I have many warm associations in Pakistan and indeed I have known on a
                        personal basis every Pakistani Prime Minister and President since Liaquat
                        Ali Khan. Moreover, I am fully sympathetic to the emotional strain which the
                        Pakistanis are undergoing in regard to India's relatively orderly political
                        development, the growth of her industries and her steady progress towards
                        the status of a major power which inevitably downgrades Pakistan
                        somewhat.</p>
                    <p>This, plus the fact that in their hearts the Pakistanis in spite of all this
                        talk are good friends of America and the China gesture is more a gimmick
                        than a commitment, leads me to feel that our aid to Pakistan should
                        continue, and that we should seek in every reasonable way to quiet their
                        fears—provided they are prepared at least to adopt a policy of neutrality in
                        regard to the China-India conflict, and to work with us in establishing a
                        better atmosphere on the subcontinent in which we can all deal more
                        effectively with the basic problems of defense and development.</p>
                    <p>I think it is fair to add that under present circumstances the military aid
                        we have given to Pakistan is wide open for attack by a Wayne Morse or some
                        other critic of our foreign policy. Although the Mutual Security Act
                        emphasizes that our military assistance is to be given for the purpose of
                        combatting the Communists, the Pakistanis have made it clear that China is
                        not a threat to her interests, and that their defenses are keyed solely
                        towards India. The very nature of the highly sophisticated and mobile
                        equipment which we have given Pakistan, equipment which is much better
                        adapted to fighting Indians on the north Indian plains than to fighting the
                        Chinese and Russians in the Himalayas and Hindu Kush, could be said by an
                        unfriendly critic to bear this out. Pakistan can correct this situation only
                        by assuming a new posture in regard to South Asian defense against China,
                        and in the types of weapons which they seek from us.</p>
                    <p>One thing is certain. Contrary to the Pakistan view we do not have the power
                        to decide whether or not India will build up her defenses. The only
                        influence we can exert is over the sources of military equipment and to some
                        degree the amounts obtained.</p>
                    <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0756"/>
                    <p>The Indians are thoroughly aroused against China and are deeply committed to
                        the creation of an adequate defense force. They can accomplish this in
                        cooperation with us (with an understanding as to ceilings, use of their own
                        foreign exchange, modest purchases from the Soviets, and a greater
                        willingness to work with us on the political containment of China in
                        Asia)—or they can go down a different road with much greater purchases in
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, a bigger defense industry of
                        their own and diversion of more of their own foreign exchange for defense
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>In South Asia at long last we have the opportunity some of us have been
                        hoping for over the years, and which was the primary reason I returned to
                        India, i.e., the building of a new relationship with India that will bring
                        her growing industrial and military potential into focus against the Chinese
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>If I am to have even a reasonable chance for negotiating the basis for the
                        new relationship I need a five-year military assistance commitment (properly
                        hedged in regard to Congress), an adequate amount of annual assistance (no
                        less than $75-$80 million including the British—a sum which is half that we
                        give to Turkey or South Korea), and maximum flexibility in regard to items
                        and timing.</p>
                    <p>Given these tools I will do my level best. Without them all we can expect is
                        a continuing impasse, the gradual strengthening of the pro-Soviet <persName
                            corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> forces in India, and the loss of a
                        major opportunity to further United States interests in Asia.</p>
                    <p>Believe me, I would not have written to you on this “eyes only” and personal
                        basis if I did not feel that the situation and my long personal relationship
                        to it warranted this direct approach. I feel the need for some contact with
                        you, with whom I have never had an opportunity to discuss this situation or
                        my relationship to it in any depth.</p>

                        Muslim shrine near Srinagar on December 27. A mass protest meeting on
                        December 28 went out of control and mobs set fire to two theatres, a hotel,
                        a police station and several cars. The Kashmir police opened fire to
                        maintain order. Two persons, one a Hindu, and the other a Muslim, reportedly
                        were killed. Curfew was imposed but on December 29 two large processions of
                        140,000 persons were permitted. No additional disturbances have been
                        reported since the 28th. Numerous arrests have been made, including certain
                        political leaders suspected of pro-Pakistan sentiments. While the police

                        Kashmir Government, the Government of India has sent investigators to study
                        the theft. Apparently the Indian Army is being used only to guard public
                        buildings. <persName>Nehru</persName> has alleged that “miscreants” have
                        been guilty of the theft to embarrass the Kashmir Government. While <gloss
                            target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> officials have avoided speculation that
                        Pakistan in any way caused the incident, the Indian press is implying that
                        such may have been the case.</p>

                    <p>Pakistan has reacted strongly to the events in Kashmir. The theft of the
                        sacred relic is being attributed to an Indian plot, possibly involving the
                        Indian Government; the press has even hinted U.S. Government involvement.
                        Indian measures to control the disturbances are being cited as evidence of a
                        program to wipe out the rights of Muslims, if not the Muslim community
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>In the first comment on the situation by a member of the Pakistan Cabinet,
                        the Minister for Kashmir affairs said that the Government of India “cannot
                        absolve itself from the terrible responsibility of genocide <pb n="732"
                            xml:id="pg_732" facs="0758"/>of the Muslim population in Kashmir and
                        India.” On December 30, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BZA1"
                            >Bhutto</persName> declared that the theft could not have taken place
                        but for the climate created by “the Government of India's evil policy of
                        suppressing the human rights of the people of Kashmir.” He also implied that
                        India has a “plan to reduce the Muslim majority of Jammu and Kashmir to a
                        minority,” and expressed the conviction that recent events will hasten the
                        Muslims' “day of deliverance from Indian aggression.”</p>

                        <item>The incident involves strong religious and communal feelings and has,
                            therefore, the potentiality of being troublesome.</item>

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Pakistan official and press reaction has followed the usual pattern of
                            exploiting the incident to highlight unsatisfactory Pakistan-Indian
                            relations. This serves the double purpose of strengthening the <gloss

                            building the case against India for possible use whenever the <gloss

                            its cause.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The incident could provide an excuse for irregular Pakistan
                            infiltrations into Indian-held Kashmir. Since personnel involved would
                            probably be locals, winter weather would not be a great impediment.
                            However, Pakistan has in the past been restrained from much activity in
                            the field, apparently realizing that it could adversely affect
                            Pakistan's international position on Kashmir.</item>

                        <item>The possibility always exists that Pakistan can use incidents in
                            Kashmir to charge that a threat to peace and security exists and to
                            reopen the question in the Security Council, since this issue remains on
                            the Council's agenda. It is doubtful, however, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> would do this under circumstances in
                            which it would receive less support than in previous sessions. To obtain
                            adequate support, it would have to seek U.S. assistance. At that time we
                            should be able to exercise considerable influence over the <gloss
