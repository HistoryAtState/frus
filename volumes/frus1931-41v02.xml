                        <p>234. At my conference today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Arita
                            handed me the following message which the Prime Minister requested me to
                            deliver personally to the Secretary of State on my forthcoming visit to
                            Washington in the hope that the message may also be brought to the
                            attention of the President: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“At present there is a serious antagonism among the nations of
                                    Europe and no one can assure that there will be no clash in the
                                    near future. If, by mischance, war is to break out, its
                                    consequences would be practically beyond our imagination and
                                    that [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>] indescribable sufferings of
                                    hundreds of millions of people as well as the complete
                                    destruction of civilization would ensue. It is, therefore,
                                    absolutely necessary for us to exert our effort to prevent the
                                    occurrence of such casualty, and, I believe, that is the duty
                                    mainly incumbent on the United States and Japan since these two
                                    powers are situated outside the scope of European conflict.</p>
                                <p>Then what are the causes of this antagonism in Europe? There may
                                    be contentions on both sides, but on cool scrutiny of the
                                    European situation since the World War we come to the conclusion
                                    that, although Germany and Italy may be advised to be more
                                    patient, Great Britain and France also have a great deal to
                                    reconsider.</p>
                                <p>Undoubtedly the intention of the United States Government is to
                                    prevent the occurrence of such catastrophe and thus to save
                                    Europe from the misery of war. Similarly, it is the ardent wish
                                    of Japan that nations should have their own proper places in the
                                    world and thus the true world peace might be established and
                                    maintained. I, for myself, am doing my utmost to realize this
                                    ideal, and on this point, I believe, will be found the
                                    possibility of much closer cooperation between Japan and America
                                    as well as the foundation of a deeper mutual understanding
                                    between the two nations.”</p>

                        <p>235. 1. Before departing tonight on leave and confiding the Embassy to
                            the effective hands of Dooman in whose judgment and analytical <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="pg_2" facs="0068"/>ability I have full confidence and whose
                            views on policy and procedure coincide very closely with mine, I wish to
                            submit the following analysis of the political situation in Japan as I
                            estimate it up to date.</p>
                        <p>2. In a long farewell conversation this morning with the Foreign Minister
                            and in a talk which he had with Dooman yesterday, Arita said that the
                            new agreement now under discussion with Germany and Italy<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d2fn2">For documents concerning the relations of Japan with
                                the European Axis Powers, see <ref target="#pg_153">pp. 153</ref>
                                ff.</note> will contain no military or political commitments except
                            such as may apply directly to combating communistic activities. Japan
                            desires to avoid European entanglements. Nevertheless, Japan regards the
                            Soviet Government and the Comintern as identical and if Soviet Russia
                            should become involved in a European war Japan herself might find it
                            impossible to avoid involvement. If Great Britain and France conclude an
                            alliance with Soviet Russia, Japan may be obliged to reconsider her
                            position vis-à-vis the totalitarian states. Apart from the specific
                            field of combating communistic activities, it will be the careful aim of
                            Japan in every other field to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality
                            between the democratic and totalitarian states.</p>
                        <p>Arita spoke with some bitterness of the efforts of Great Britain to draw
                            Russia into a military alliance. It was all very well to say, as
                                Craigie<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">British Ambassador in
                                Japan.</note> had said to him, that the proposed British plan would
                            not be applicable in the Far East, but the fact is that Russia straddles
                            both Europe and Asia; even if the British plan were specifically to
                            exclude the Far East, the close association which it would bring about
                            among Great Britain, France, and Russia would inevitably lead to the
                            closest collaboration in the pursuit of their policies in the Far East.
                            Japan, as before stated, has every desire to avoid involvement in every
                            instance and to maintain a neutral position between the two groups, but
                            if the British plan goes through and thus prepares a basis for concerted
                            action in the Far East by the democracies, Japan would necessarily have
                            to reconsider her position vis-à-vis Germany and Italy. In this
                            connection, he went on to say that if war were to break out in
                            Europe—and he believes that there is no immediate danger—and the United
                            States becomes involved, the position which Russia might take might
                            conceivably decide whether peace could be maintained between the United
                            States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>3. The Minister made to me the following confidential oral statement:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Japan is bound to Germany and Italy by the tie of anti-communism
                                    and as we deem it necessary, further strengthening of <pb n="3"
                                        xml:id="pg_3" facs="0069"/>this bond is being seriously
                                    considered. But if any one should regard Japan, because she had
                                    taken such a measure, as joining into the camp of totalitarian
                                    nations in opposition to the democratic nations, he would surely
                                    be misunderstanding the true intention of the Japanese
                                    Government. Japan is not a totalitarian, no more than a
                                    democratic, state. She has an original constitution of her own
                                    which is centered around the Imperial family, and is based on
                                    the spirit of levying [<hi rend="italic">allowing?</hi>]
                                    everything to have its own proper place, surpassing all ideas of
                                    antagonism. In joining hands with Germany and Italy we have no
                                    other purposes than to combat the destructive activities of
                                    Comintern. If the United States, not understanding the true
                                    intention of Japan on this point, should base her future
                                    policies on such misunderstanding, it would bring about a
                                    deplorable situation not only respecting the relations between
                                    the United States and Japan but also in respect of the peace of
                                    the world.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>4. Arita said to me, and I believe his statement to be accurate, that
                            there is now no substantial opposition in the Government to the proposed
                            arrangement with Germany and Italy as now formulated. At the present
                            moment the Cabinet appears to have weathered the recent storm and to be
                            momentarily secure. I do not, however, believe that this present
                            security can be regarded as permanent because [of] many divergent forces
                            active within the country.</p>
                        <p>5. In my conversation with the Foreign Minister I then turned to the
                            question of America’s legitimate rights and interests in China which are
                            now subject to serious interference by Japan and I stated that
                            Japanese-American relations could not be expected to improve until these
                            interferences were removed. I also emphasized the deplorable effects of
                            the bombing operations.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">See <ref
                                    target="frus1931-41v01#pg_487">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>,

                            these points?</p>
                        <p>6. The Minister’s reply was ambiguous and vague. He said that most of the
                            interferences of which we complained were temporary and would disappear
                            as military necessity permitted but that certain measures, such as
                            exchange control in North China, might be permanent. There is no
                            intention, he said, to limit American trade beyond the requirements of
                            military necessity or to discriminate against American commerce.<note

                            authorities is hoped for. In connection with the general question of
                            economic rights and interests in China, he said that the feeling of
                            resentment in this country against Great Britain is so strong that it
                            was hopeless to try to improve relations with that country. He would be
                            satisfied if his efforts were successful to prevent these relations from
                            becoming worse than <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0070"/>they now are.
                            The position with regard to relations with the United States was an
                            entirely different one, as there is a general call for improvement. He
                            was making a strong effort along those lines and hoped to be able to
                            show concrete results before long.</p>
                        <p>7. The Minister then made to me the following confidential oral
                            statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have previously stated frankly my opinion regarding the new
                                    order in East Asia and we have had occasions of exchanging views
                                    on this question. However, I regret to say that Japan’s position
                                    does not seem to have been fully understood.</p>
                                <p>I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize once again that the
                                    Japanese Government in establishing the new order have no
                                    intention of excluding trade and other legitimate economic
                                    activities in China of the countries of Europe and America. The
                                    establishment of a new order is not exclusive in character as is
                                    thought in some quarters, but is the means by which trade and
                                    other economic relations between East Asia and the European and
                                    American countries will eventually prosper on a sound basis.</p>
                                <p>As Japan is now carrying on large-scale military operations, and
                                    has only recently embarked upon the undertaking of realizing the
                                    ideal of the establishment of a new order, the military or
                                    economic necessity require some measures which may cause
                                    inconveniences to nationals of the third powers and affect their
                                    rights and interests. But, since such measures are, as a rule,
                                    exceptional and temporary in character, any judgment formed on
                                    the basis of the present abnormal conditions is apt to lead to
                                    misunderstanding of the real intention of Japan. Such an outcome
                                    is much to be regretted as being likely to disturb the
                                    foundation of the relations between Japan and the United States,
                                    the two countries which should always remain friendly to each
                                    other. Therefore it is earnestly desired that, in dealing with
                                    various questions arising between our two countries with regard
                                    to China, the United States will understand that large-scale
                                    military operations are in progress over an extremely wide area
                                    and will at the same time consider the new situation in East
                                    Asia on a broader perspective so that she will arrive at a
                                    balanced judgment.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>He amplified this statement by reverting to one of his favorite themes:
                            National defense has an economic as well as a military aspect. The
                            United States is well equipped in both respects; however, while Japan
                            has an army and navy strong enough to meet any military threat, her
                            economic defense is inadequate; and she cannot enjoy a sense of security
                            until the deficiencies in the latter respect have been made good.</p>
                        <p>8. The Minister on his own initiative then turned to the subject of the
                            so-called “South Sea advance” and made to me the following confidential

                                    the impression as though Japan entertained some territorial

                                    interested countries are apprehensive, and that even some
                                    Americans have a similar apprehension with regard to the

                            coast of Kwangtung Province, China, by the Imperial armed forces are
                            purely military in character and are for the purpose of wiping out enemy

                            your authorities in China will cooperate fully in the efforts of the
                            Imperial armed forces to eliminate or reduce to a minimum accidental
                            damage to interests of your country and will take special measures to
                            avoid the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. At the same time it is

                            <p>On his return to Washington Ambassador Grew delivered to me
                                personally the message which Your Excellency was so good as to place
                                in his hands through the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs. I
                                have read with unusual interest the expressions of Your Excellency’s
                                concern at the existence among the nations of Europe of antagonism
                                which may lead to open conflict, and of Your Excellency’s concern as
                                to what the consequences might be to millions of people and to
                                civilization should such antagonism lead to an outbreak of war. In
                                this situation Your Excellency sees it as the duty of the
                                Governments of our two countries, owing to their situation “outside
                                the scope of European conflict” to exert efforts to prevent the
                                occurrence of the casualty envisaged.</p>
                            <p>I have carefully noted also the statements pertaining to the causes
                                of strained relations in the European situation, the interest of my
                                Government in the preservation of peace, and finally the “ardent
                                wish of Japan” that the relations of nations might be so arranged
                                that true world peace would be established and maintained.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency will have no doubt, in the light of the published
                                utterances of the President and myself and of the principles we have
                                advocated and supported, that the Government of the United States
                                wholeheartedly desires to see established and maintained upon the
                                basis of fair dealing and fair play between and among nations a
                                condition of true world peace. With especial reference to the
                                situation in Europe, Your Excellency will be apprised of the recent
                                earnest efforts of this Government: the President’s identic messages
                                sent on September 26, 1938, to the heads of several European
                                governments which had reached an alarming crisis in their

                            <p>It would be most gratifying to me, and I may also speak for the
                                President, if there could be found ways for the use of your
                                Government’s influence toward discouraging among European
                                governments, especially those governments with which your Government
                                may have special relations, the taking of any action, or the
                                pursuance of any policy, that might endanger the general peace. I am
                                confident that any such contribution as this would constitute a high
                                service to those great sections of humanity which live in fear of
                                the devastation of war.</p>
                            <p>In further reference to Your Excellency’s expressed desire to see a
                                true world peace established and maintained, I venture to observe,
                                in a spirit of frankness which I trust will not be misunderstood,
                                that this objective is made the more remote by the existence and the
                                continuance of armed conflict and consequent political disturbances
                                in the Far East today. Just as the unfolding of events in the
                                European sphere have their repercussions in the Far East, so, it
                                appears, the prolongation of abnormal conditions in the Far East
                                contribute to causes of unrest in Europe. American opinion is
                                therefore perturbed by the trend of events in the Far East,
                                especially with regard to various declared Japanese aims and to
                                various methods and instrumentalities which various Japanese
                                agencies employ in pursuit thereof.<note n="10" xml:id="d4fn10">The
                                    last phrase, beginning with the word “especially”, has been
                                    corrected in accordance with instructions in telegram No. 239,
                                    August 2, 1939, 9 p.m., to the Chargé in Japan.</note></p>
                            <p>If, therefore, it should prove impracticable or inexpedient to make
                                effective contribution at once to the settlement of problems arising
                                in the European area, there nevertheless would be urgent need for
                                the exertion of efforts in connection with disturbed conditions in
                                other geographical areas, especially by those nations which may
                                unhappily now be engaged in armed conflict. It is my view that each
                                peaceful settlement, in whatever geographical sphere, constitutes a
                                stabilizing element and an important step toward improvement in the
                                general world situation.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency may be assured of the genuine desire of the President
                                and myself to do all within our power to convert into practical
                                results those principles and hopes to which we have frequently given
                                expression in connection with the foreign relations of the
                                Government of the United States. While this Government does not
                                perceive any practicable steps which it might usefully take at this
                                time in addition to those already taken, this Government is
                                sincerely interested in the suggestion contained in Your
                                Excellency’s message, and in giving further consideration to that
                                suggestion would be pleased to have such further information as Your
                                Excellency may <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0074"/>find it
                                agreeable to offer by way of amplifying and making more definitive
                                Your Excellency’s concept as to the steps which might usefully be
                                taken toward moderating the situation in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Counselor came to say goodbye. After an exchange of the
                            usual remarks on such occasions, Mr. Suma referred to the differences
                            now existing between our countries after a long-standing friendship. He
                            proceeded to add that the new Japanese Government would have as a chief
                            purpose the restoration of good relations between our two countries. He
                            then inquired if I had anything to say that he might repeat to his
                            Government officials upon his return to Tokyo. I replied that I had
                            nothing particularly in mind more than what I had said to the Japanese
                            Ambassador on August 26th<note n="11" xml:id="d5fn11">See memorandum by

                            here. I went on to state that I had heretofore already said about all I
                            could say on this general subject; that I was mindful of the long
                            friendship between the people of Japan and the people of the United
                            States; that my Government, during the present period when international
                            law is being kicked aside and ignored, treaty obligations violated with
                            impunity, and an increasing state of international lawlessness is in
                            evidence in so many parts of the world, all the more vigorously upholds
                            the integrity of international law, of treaty observation, of friendly
                            relations with every other nation alike, including Japan, based also on
                            the rule of fair play and fair dealing; that my Government, of course,
                            is very desirous of a resumption of normal international relations
                            everywhere based on the foregoing principles and rules of conduct, which
                            would include the principle of equality of treatment and opportunity
                            both commercially and industrially.</p>
                        <p>I then said to the Counselor that I might repeat the message I sent to
                            his country by a previous Counselor who called some two years ago to say
                            goodbye before returning home, and that was that I would have him say to
                            his statesmen that some of these days the fact will dawn upon the three
                            or four most powerful nations of the world, including his country and
                            mine, that there is room enough on this planet for sixteen or eighteen
                            such nations to live and thrive, maintaining all of those normal and
                            peaceful and other worthwhile relations that would make possible the
                            fullest measure of human progress; that when that fact was realized the
                            human race would be just ten times better off than it is or will be
                            otherwise in the future. The <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0075"
                            />Counselor strove to be most agreeable in his conversation and demeanor
                            and took no issue on anything I said, but made it clear that his
                            Government now would undertake to restore mutually desirable relations
                            between our two countries.</p>

                        <p>458. Sawada, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, summoned me to the
                            Foreign Office and informed me that, on behalf of the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, he (Sawada) had handed a note to the diplomatic
                            representatives of the belligerent countries. Sawada gave me a copy of
                            the note, of which the following is a substantial translation: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Confronted by the recent outbreak of a European war, the
                                    Government of Japan plans to avoid becoming involved in that war
                                    and to devote its energies to settling the China incident. In
                                    connection with this intention and in view of the profound
                                    concern with which the Government of Japan regards the attitude
                                    toward the situation in China taken by other nations, the
                                    Government of Japan desires to ask that, in deference to the
                                    Japanese Government’s above-mentioned intention, no measures of
                                    a character likely to affect injuriously the position of Japan
                                    with reference to the China affair be taken by the
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>With respect, moreover, to areas of China controlled by Japanese
                                    forces, it is to be feared that the presence in such areas of
                                    naval vessels and troops belonging to powers participating in
                                    the conflict in Europe might result in unfortunate incidents and
                                    in a condition of affairs ill-adapted to Japan’s noninvolvement
                                    policy. The Government of Japan accordingly believes that it is
                                    incumbent upon it to proffer to the belligerent nations in
                                    question friendly advice that they effect—as a voluntary act—the
                                    withdrawal of their naval vessels and troops from the
                                    above-mentioned areas; and, it may be added, the Japanese
                                    authorities, upon the removal of these vessels and troops, will
                                    be prepared to exert every possible effort toward safeguarding
                                    lives and properties of citizens of the belligerent
                                    nations.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Later I was told by the Foreign Minister’s private secretary that to the
                            British, French, Polish, and German Ambassadors, representing the
                            belligerent nations, and to the Italian Ambassador and myself as
                            representatives of neutral nations, had been handed the above quoted
                            note.</p>
                        <p>In handing the copy of this note to me the Vice Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs asked me to communicate it to the Government of <pb n="10"
                                xml:id="pg_10" facs="0076"/>the United States for “its information.”
                            With reference to the note, he orally added that his Government
                            considered it of primary importance to avoid the development of any
                            situation in territory of China under the control of forces of Japan
                            which might ultimately result in Japan’s becoming involved in the
                            European war. I remarked that the possible breaking out in occupied
                            territories of China of a conflict between the armed forces or citizens
                            of the warring nations of a nature to cause Japan to become involved in
                            the war in Europe was exceedingly difficult for me to visualize. The
                            Vice Minister stated that on the morning of September 5 an incident was
                            reported involving invasion by British naval ratings of the German Club
                            in the Shanghai International Settlement and that the prevention of
                            further such incidents and of cases even more serious was desired. I
                            then asked if the Japanese request in regard to removal of forces in
                            China of belligerent nations was to be construed as applicable to forces
                            which the warring countries maintain in the foreign concessions and
                            international settlements—if, for instance, the withdrawal by the
                            British and French of their forces from the Shanghai International
                            Settlement and French Concession, respectively, was desired by the
                            Japanese Government. To this Sawada answered “Yes” without
                            qualification, and discussion of the subject thereupon ceased.</p>
                        <p>Utilizing the occasion presented, I inquired as to the accuracy of a
                            statement to the effect that no formal proclamation of neutrality would
                            be published by the Japanese Government, which appeared in the press on
                            the morning of September 5. The Vice Minister’s reply was to the effect
                            that the statement issued by the Japanese Cabinet the evening of
                            September 4 had made clear the Japanese Government’s attitude and that
                            for the present no further steps in that direction were envisaged.</p>

                        <p>459. With reference to the Japanese note, a translation of which was
                            telegraphed the Department yesterday (Embassy’s No. 458), only the first
                            paragraph of the note has been published here. There has been no
                            disclosure here of the “friendly advice” statement, as to the withdrawal
                            of British and French warships and troops from <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11"
                                facs="0077"/>China, or of any other part of the important second
                            paragraph. There is probably some significance in the concealment from
                            the Japanese public that the Japanese Government has made what amounts
                            to a drastic demand on the Governments of Great Britain and France.</p>
                        <p>I think that the Japanese move is intended either to permit a graceful
                            retreat if their advice is found unacceptable, or else that the people
                            of Japan are not to be enlightened until they find themselves faced with
                            a situation from drastic action already taken. In either the one case or
                            the other, I am of the firm opinion that nothing would have a more
                            healthy effect than a statement from the American Government expressing
                            its unqualified disapproval of Japan’s action as calculated to prejudice
                            both directly and indirectly the position in China of non-Oriental
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow afternoon I am to make a formal call on the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, on his appointment. The thought occurs to me that I might say
                            at that time, informally and as an expression of my personal opinion,
                            that Japan is at present more dependent upon the United States as a
                            source of supply for machinery, raw materials, etc., than ever before in
                            order to meet the increasing demand which the European war has created
                            for Japanese goods. I should continue by saying that what is, actually,
                            a demand that British and French forces in China be withdrawn from China
                            cannot fail to raise the query whether, bearing in mind the fact that
                            there are no German forces whatever in China, Japan’s real intention may
                            not be the elimination from China of Western influence; and, in
                            conclusion, that any action taken by Japan which would tend to confirm
                            the foregoing view would not be helpful in disposing the American public
                            to help Japan to benefit economically or commercially from the European
                            situation now existing.</p>
                        <p>Is any objection perceived to the making of the above statement in the
                            manner suggested? In Japanese history the term “friendly advice” has had
                            sinister associations; first, when Japan was pressed by continental
                            European powers to return Kwantung to China after the war between China
                            and Japan in 1894,<note n="13" xml:id="d7fn13">For the text of the notes

                            subject referred to therein to the British and the French Ambassadors in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the suggestion contained in paragraph two of your
                            telegram No. 459, September 6, 7 p.m., final sentence, the Department
                            has it under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the third paragraph of your telegram No. 459, we do not feel
                            that it would be advisable, in your conversation with Arita, to make any
                            reference to Japan’s dependence upon this country for materials or to
                            the effect that the Japanese action to which you refer might possibly
                            have upon the commercial relations between Japan and the United States.
                            No objection is perceived by the Department, however, to your pointing
                            out to Arita that it is your opinion that any action on the part of the
                            Government of Japan to force the withdrawal of armed forces of France
                            and Great Britain in China from that country, would be interpreted in
                            the United States as a direct step toward the elimination of Western
                            influence from China; and that in the United States the consequent
                            reaction as regards Japanese-American relations would certainly be
                            seriously prejudicial.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at my request. I said that in the light of
                            our recent conversations, which emphasized his desire, and in a general
                            sense of course my desire, to improve relations on a basis of
                            friendliness and fair play between our two countries, just as between
                            ours and all other countries, I was genuinely surprised to receive a
                            copy, through official channels, of the notice given to the British and
                            French to take their naval vessels out of Shanghai waters and their
                            guards out of the Shanghai area, and presumably out of all other
                            localities in China where they are stationed. I then spoke orally to the
                            Ambassador from a prepared manuscript, substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>The American Government has received from the American Embassy in Tokyo a
                            text of the note presented by the Japanese Government to the governments
                            of belligerent nations, in which the Japanese <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13"
                                facs="0079"/>Government advises the belligerents to withdraw their
                            troops and warships from regions in China which are under the control of
                            the Japanese armed forces, a copy of which was handed to the American
                            Chargé for communication to this Government for purposes of
                            information.</p>
                        <p>I find it necessary to bring to the attention of the Japanese Government
                            the fact that the advice thus given to the governments of belligerent
                            powers directly affects rights and interests of the United States. For
                            the moment, I shall speak only of the situation at Shanghai. At that
                            port several foreign countries, including both Japan and the United
                            States, maintain landed armed forces. These forces are there for the
                            purpose of assistance in the protection of the lives of the nationals
                            respectively of the various countries concerned, and, in connection with
                            that duty, the maintaining of order in general. The powers have in that
                            connection both individual and common responsibilities. In the opinion
                            of the American Government, the fact that some of these powers have
                            become belligerents in other parts of the world affords no more sound a
                            basis for advice by Japan that those powers withdraw their forces from
                            Shanghai than would the fact that Japan is engaged in hostilities afford
                            for a similar giving of advice by some other power to Japan that Japan
                            withdraw her forces from the same area. In passing, I may point out that
                            no such demands were made by any power in 1914, at which time Japan was
                            a belligerent.</p>
                        <p>If, in the presence of the Japanese advice, the British and the French
                            forces are withdrawn, it will create a situation fraught with extreme
                            difficulties of many practical kinds both for Japan and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I proceeded to speak orally from a supplementary manuscript,
                            substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>The International Settlement at Shanghai has grown up in consequence of
                            efforts and activities begun by nationals of various powers—prominent
                            among whom were and have been Americans, British subjects and French
                            subjects—more than a century ago. The foundations of the port were laid
                            and its prosperity was developed long before Japan began to take an
                            active interest in world commerce. The International Settlement is an
                            area wherein persons of all nationalities reside and which is governed
                            by the locally created and locally maintained agency whose officers are
                            elected by and are responsible to its own taxpayers regardless of
                            nationality. Interests of the various powers there are interwoven. Not
                            since the middle of the nineteenth century has any one power claimed a
                            right of preponderance or predominance of influence there. The United
                            States has its rights and interests there just as has Japan. The
                            respective rights and interests of the various powers there are
                            interdependent. Shanghai is <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0080"
                            />international. For several other powers to be forced out would mean to
                            the United States that all powers are being forced out. The American
                            Government cannot and does not admit any right on the part of any power
                            to force it out. The rights of the United States have in many ways been
                            impaired by acts of Japanese authorities during recent years. There are
                            many ways in which the United States is capable of taking action of
                            retaliation. The American Government would view with great regret and
                            disapproval action by the Japanese Government in consequence of which
                            the international character of the port of Shanghai would be
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>In further conversation, in addition to the foregoing, I re-emphasized
                            the utter lack of right or reason or consistency on the part of the
                            Government of Japan to order these other Governments out of Shanghai and
                            to break up the International Settlement and its government—for, I added
                            with emphasis, the proposed action of Japan would result in just
                            that—and I said, therefore, he must understand that my Government is
                            very much concerned with respect to the definite rights and interests
                            thus threatened. I said that in view of the action of the Japanese
                            military authorities in China in insisting on exclusive occupation of
                            the Yangtze River to all practical intents and purposes, with its
                            immense deprivation of commercial rights and interests of Americans, and
                            similar action in many cities and localities throughout China, and in
                            the light of the so-called Japanese preachment of “a new order in Asia
                            or eastern Asia”, this Government must make clear its conclusion that
                            the purpose behind the Japanese notice to the British and French is not
                            a mere innocent, friendly purpose, but a purpose further to exclude
                            first one set of nationals of another country, and then another set of
                            nationals of still another country, until the Shanghai situation would
                            be on a parity with the Yangtze River situation and others like it in
                            China. I then said, “How does your Government expect us to prevent the
                            Congress and the country, if we should attempt to do so, from taking up
                            the question of our monetary and financial and trade relations with your
                            country and dealing with it in a way that you can well imagine in the
                            light of all the circumstances?”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador made no defense except to quietly suggest that Japan
                            through friendly motives was giving this notice for the avoidance of
                            possible friction in China. I re-emphasized what I had already said in
                            relation to this phase and stated that we could not possibly give that
                            interpretation to the notice.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I would like to have an indication of the Japanese
                            Government’s reaction in the light of the exposition of the subject
                            which I had made to the Ambassador, as recorded above.</p>

                        <p>463.…</p>
                        <p>(2) As the Japanese Foreign Minister this afternoon received all chiefs
                            of mission in turn, interviews were necessarily very brief. The Foreign
                            Minister expressed regret that Japanese-United States relations are not
                            marked by the mutual friendship and confidence which he would desire for
                            them and that incidents arousing American feeling against Japan had
                            occurred in spite of the Japanese Government’s efforts to prevent injury
                            to American interests in China. He stated that he would sincerely
                            endeavor to improve Japanese relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mentioning the Japanese Government’s notes communicated to the
                            belligerent European powers on September 5, the Foreign Minister said he
                            wished to emphasize Japan’s determination against becoming involved in
                            the European war and in favor of doing simultaneously what was possible
                            to prevent extension of the hostilities to the Far East. Japan would be
                            glad, he added, to cooperate with nations which were animated equally by
                            a desire to confine the war to the present belligerents.</p>
                        <p>(3) Replying, I said I would not fail to report the Foreign Minister’s
                            observations to my Government. It had been the endeavor of the United
                            States, I said, to cooperate with Japan along with other nations in
                            order to promote peace in the Far East; but that the differences in
                            American and Japanese objectives and policies were militating against
                            cooperation, a particularly unfortunate condition at this time when
                            mutual friendship and trust were needed so badly between nations not
                            engaged in the European war for the purpose of terminating as soon as
                            possible the war in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at his own request. He said that he had
                            had a number of dispatches from his Government since our conference a
                            week ago yesterday, at which time we discussed the reported <pb n="16"
                                xml:id="pg_16" facs="0082"/>plans or threats of Japan to push the
                            British and French guards or troops out of Shanghai, thus leaving the
                            British and French sectors unguarded. The Ambassador prefaced his
                            statement by bringing into the scope of our discussion the guards or
                            troops located at Tientsin and Peking. I interrupted to say that, while
                            our conversation of last week related primarily to the International
                            Settlement situation at Shanghai, I had also in mind the Tientsin and
                            Peking situations but assumed that no discussion of them was necessary
                            for the reason that the rights of all foreign governments, including
                            those of Japan and the United States, were definitely and firmly fixed

                                    312</ref>.</note> that I further assumed that this international
                            agreement would not be violated, and, hence, no particular reference to
                            those two situations appeared to be as urgent as the Shanghai question.
                            The Ambassador told me his Government had instructed him to elaborate on
                            what he had said to me last week in our conference.</p>
                        <p>He then proceeded to relate, more or less in the way of repetition, in
                            fact, that the British and French troops in China were more or less of a
                            menace to peace and might involve Japan in the European war situation;
                            that if Italy should enter the war, the Italian troops at Shanghai might
                            clash with the British and French troops; that German nationals in
                            Shanghai might easily be attacked by British troops or at least a clash
                            might occur between them; that Japan was very desirous of remaining
                            neutral in the European war situation, and that these steps, in the way
                            of friendly advice, to get the British and French to withdraw their
                            troops would clarify the peace situation and remove possible dangers of
                            clashes and military complications, as already stated. The Ambassador
                            finally added that, of course, his Government had no idea or purpose to
                            invite the guards or troops of my Government to leave Shanghai. This was
                            the substance of his comment, which was chiefly a repetition of what he
                            had said last week. It was all in a friendly tone and conveyed nothing
                            resembling threats on the part of his Government towards this
                            Government, but, on the contrary, he indicated that our two governments
                            would or might be in key positions to promote peace when and if the
                            psychological occasion should present itself.</p>
                        <p>I said that I desired first to draw the attention of his Government to
                            what my Government considers a definite, clean-cut distinction between
                            regular military forces and the guards or troops of my Government, the
                            Japanese and other governments which were first installed in China in
                            connection with the Boxer Rebellion and also in connection with the
                            International Settlement at Shanghai. I said <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17"
                                facs="0083"/>that the primary function of these armed guards is to
                            protect their respective nationals against mob violence or violence from
                            other uncontrolled forces in those areas of China which the regular
                            police protection could not cope with; that these are really guards and
                            not forces intended to perform the regular functions of military forces;
                            that, therefore, I thought the Government of Japan was not now in a
                            position to justify a proposal, apparently serious, to induce these
                            British and French guards to retire, on the theory that their functions
                            are those of regular military forces; that I would request the
                            Government of Japan to give this point further consideration and also to
                            keep in mind the fact that these local questions pertaining to guards of
                            my Government and the Japanese and other governments in China are not
                            legitimately related, certainly to any major or serious extent, to
                            whatever plan or program Japan has in China at present, whether it be a
                            program of preserving order or of absolute subjugation; that, therefore,
                            I considered it to the interest of both my Government and that of Japan
                            as well to take the position that these questions have no legitimate
                            relationship to the controversy between Japan and China for the reason
                            that they are essentially international in their nature and separate
                            from Japanese-Chinese controversies, just as they have been considered
                            as separate from purely Chinese governmental affairs in the past. I
                            emphasized the view of this Government that should the Japanese get the
                            British and French guards out of Shanghai, it would have the effect of
                            disrupting the whole government situation, would seriously affect the
                            rights and interests of Americans there, and would be calculated to
                            create the impression among the people of the United States that there
                            was basis to reports already rife, to the effect that Japan’s purpose is
                            to sweep all foreigners out of China; that, furthermore, compared to any
                            trivial advantage a change in the Shanghai situation might be to Japan,
                            the misunderstanding and the feeling aroused among the American people
                            against Japan would result in an immense net loss to his country. I said
                            that I need not remind the Ambassador that this Government had publicly
                            announced that its policy was to remove its guards from China as soon as
                            the Chinese authorities became able to preserve order and to afford
                            protection to our nationals and their interests; that this Government
                            was virtually reaching the stage when this step would be deemed feasible
                            at the precise time that Japan moved her military forces into China, and
                            that, of course, we had not been in a position since that time to bring
                            our guards out. I said that so far as the Shanghai situation was
                            concerned, while the armed forces which my Government and other
                            governments have there are for guard purposes primarily, yet when it
                            came to removing them by any threat of force or undue insistence
                            bordering on duress, <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0084"/>they would
                            become a symbol of their respective nations, which, in the psychological
                            effect is of immeasurably greater importance than any small benefits
                            Japan might acquire by forcing the moving out of these guards.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that the Japanese were undertaking by amicable
                            discussion to settle all these matters. I expressed my gratification at
                            this assurance, and emphasized the definite policy of this Government to
                            settle all matters with other governments by amicable and friendly
                            discussion and not to cease until ways were found to that end. I then
                            said to the Ambassador, as he kept repeating his foregoing statement,
                            that he, of course was aware of the reports, already referred to, to the
                            effect that his Government seeks to clear out all foreigners from China,
                            and I then said that I would like to bring his attention especially to
                            this fact, namely, that on yesterday when Mr. Sumner Welles, Under
                            Secretary of State, was in the act of leaving for the Pan American
                            Conference at Panama, which would deal with phases of commerce and
                            finance, the President and I gave special instructions that in any
                            resolutions we presented, absolute equality of industrial rights and
                            opportunities should be preserved and kept open as heretofore to Japan,
                            Germany, Great Britain, France, and all other nations of the world
                            alike, and I then said, “Why is it that your Government does not pursue
                            this spirit as well as this policy and make it known to all so there can
                            be no misunderstanding?” The Ambassador straightened up in his chair but
                            offered no particular reply except to say that of course he understood
                            the idea I was undertaking to emphasize. He then said that, of course,
                            his Government had no idea of inviting this Government to take its
                            guards out of Shanghai, much less of threatening force for that purpose;
                            that his Government would expect to confer with this Government about
                            the policing situation in so far as the guards were concerned, and he
                            indicated that that would be its policy with respect to the guards in
                            other places. I again came back to the proposition that in my profound
                            belief the ideas I had expressed for this Government were virtually of
                            the same interest to the Government of Japan; that I was satisfied the
                            Japanese proposal to oust guards of the British and French would have
                            the definite result of breaking down and destroying the International
                            Settlement with the resultant serious practical difficulties which would
                            arise between our two countries and that I simply could not follow the
                            reasoning of his Government in its efforts to link these almost purely
                            international phases with whatever program the Japanese Government might
                            have in China from a military standpoint. I again requested the
                            Ambassador to bring up these differing and opposing viewpoints with his
                            Government and to urge it to give them further consideration. The
                            Ambassador <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0085"/>spoke about his
                            Government acting without special relations with other governments, and
                            I replied that I was speaking only for my Government, which at all times
                            maintains the fullest freedom of action, and I added that, of course,
                            there were instances where there were common interests and common
                            purposes, etc., when parallel action with other governments would be
                            natural. When the Ambassador said that his Government would expect to
                            confer with this Government in regard to the policing situation at
                            Shanghai, I made no comment. I then added that, of course, taking the
                            genesis of the entire situation there and considering all of its phases,
                            past and present, my Government could not bring out its guards on the
                            basis of an unwarranted suggestion or threat by another government. The
                            Ambassador made no comment on this. He left with the promise that he
                            would take the matters up further as I had requested.</p>

                            all, permit me to express my great satisfaction on returning from leave
                            of absence to learn that there has been improvement in the health of our
                            beloved President, Prince Tokugawa. I well know that I am reflecting the
                            hopes of all of us in most heartily wishing that he may before long find
                            complete recovery and return to the chair which he so long has occupied
                            with distinction and great helpfulness. I beg that our Chairman today
                            may be good enough to convey to the Prince an expression of this deep
                            feeling.</p>
                        <p>Your welcome today is genuinely appreciated. Last spring we were going
                            “home” to the United States, and this autumn, when we left America, we
                            were going “home” to Japan. When one has remained for seven years at a
                            post, one can hardly regard it as other than “home”. At any rate, that
                            is the way my wife and I feel about Japan and especially about Tokyo,
                            and that same feeling extends to our friends here, both Japanese and
                            American. To come once again to a gathering of this Society is to come
                            into a homelike atmosphere, and that in itself gives us a very warm
                            feeling. We thank you for your welcome.</p>
                        <p>I have been told of rumors that have been flitting about here and there
                            to the effect that we were not returning to Japan. If there have been
                            such rumors, they just have been based on speculation, pure and simple,
                            for at no moment has there been the slightest doubt about our returning.
                            Having been on the job here for approximately three years without a day
                            of furlough, I was very considerately given an <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20"
                                facs="0086"/>extra month of leave, over and above the usual sixty
                            days in the United States. Some of you with whom I talked before our
                            departure may remember that I said at that time that I expected to be
                            back in September or October, and here we are, right on schedule. Our
                            plans have undergone no change and no thought of change.</p>
                        <p>We have had a pleasant and interesting time. Much of our furlough was
                            spent at our place at Hancock in the refreshing hills and woods of New
                            Hampshire where we were surrounded by our three daughters, occasionally
                            some sons-in-law and six grandchildren, which inevitably made me feel
                            something like an old patriarch, but we had time for visits also and we
                            saw both the New York and the Golden Gate worlds fairs which, of course,
                            were thrilling. I visited Washington on three occasions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Worlds Fairs in New York and in San Francisco I think
                            that Japan has every reason to be proud of her pavilions and exhibits. I
                            spent much time studying them in both places. The Japanese pavilion in
                            the New York Fair is of great beauty. The Japanese exhibit in the
                            Division of Pacific Cultures at the Golden Gate International Exposition
                            and the effective way in which it is presented is past all praise. These
                            objects, portraying the historical sequence of Japanese art and culture,
                            have most courteously been lent not only by many of the foremost
                            Japanese collectors, many of them personal friends of mine, but also by
                            the Imperial Household Museum. As Mr. K. Sato wrote in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Official Catalogue</hi> of the Department of Fine Arts
                            of the Exposition: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Yes, we in America do feel the lift of the same tides that wash the
                            beaches of Japan. I hope that both our nations will always and
                            progressively feel the lift of those tides of friendship. I have
                            returned to Japan to devote all that I have to give, now and in future,
                            to try to inspire new life in those tides.</p>
                        <p>As for the future, Mrs. Grew and I are going to try to return to the
                            United States as often as possible—every year or two if it is feasible,
                            although such a plan must necessarily depend upon many unpredictable
                            factors and is perhaps just a bit optimistic. But there is no doubt in
                            my mind that an Ambassador can do more helpful work and can more
                            intelligently and effectively represent his Government and can better
                            contribute to clear international understanding upon which good
                            international relations are built when given frequent opportunity <pb
                                n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0087"/>for personal contact with his
                            Government and the people of his own country. As I have often said,
                            indeed as I said not long ago before this distinguished Society, an
                            ambassador is essentially an interpreter, an interpreter of official and
                            public opinion as they exist in his own country and in the country of
                            his residence. By going home this year I was able to do a great deal of
                            interpreting of Japan and of Japanese opinion both to my Government and
                            to the American people. A number of addresses were made to important
                            groups and I talked with a large number of people. I hope and believe
                            that my interpretations were fair and accurate. It was made very clear
                            that the Japanese picture has many sides and many angles, and that
                            without a comprehension of these many sides and angles, it is difficult
                            if not impossible for another people far away to arrive at a clear and
                            accurate conception of the basic causes and incentives that lead to
                            Japanese thought and policy and action. Those talks aroused much
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>I enjoyed several constructive talks with my good friend Ambassador
                            Horinouchi who is ably representing Japan in our country, and with other
                            Japanese visiting or residing in the United States.</p>
                        <p>In the same way, there can be no doubt that as a result of my stay in the
                            United States and my personal contacts with a large number of Americans,
                            both official and unofficial, my interpretations here of American
                            thought and policy and action are going to be much more complete and
                            accurate than they could have been had this summer’s furlough not taken
                            place. We have a phrase in English “straight from the horse’s mouth.” I
                            never knew why the particular animal chosen was a horse, especially as
                            most horses are generally not very communicative. But the meaning is
                            clear enough. What I shall say in Japan in the ensuing months comes
                            “straight from the horse’s mouth” in that it will accurately represent
                            and interpret some of the current thoughts of the American Government
                            and people with regard to Japan and the Far East. I had the privilege of
                            also conferring repeatedly with the President and with the Secretary of
                            State during my stay at home.</p>
                        <p>But here I am constrained to pause before passing on, to pause in
                            sadness, in deepest sorrow, yes and in impotent bitterness, at the
                            dreadful holocaust that has broken loose in Europe, a holocaust not of
                            God’s doing but of man’s. That we, in our lifetime, should have to pass
                            through another such frightful disaster seems an intolerable burden for
                            one generation of humanity. I shall not try to deal with that subject
                            today; indeed, what could possibly be said to alter in any infinitesimal
                            degree the blackness of the cloud that has descended upon us? I say “us”
                            advisedly. I pray with all my heart and mind that we in America may be
                            spared from participation again in armed conflict, but in this modern
                            world of ours no nation and no people can emerge <pb n="22"
                                xml:id="pg_22" facs="0088"/>unscathed from the effects, direct or
                            indirect, of warfare anywhere. When the structure of international good
                            faith, when the reliance of mankind and government upon the
                            inviolability of the pledged word becomes undermined and collapses, when
                            might makes right and force becomes an instrument of national policy
                            rather than discussion and settlement of disputes by peaceful means,
                            then civilization crumbles also and chaos intervenes.</p>
                        <p>I turn now to some of the thoughts of the American Government and of the
                            American people with regard to the situation in East Asia in general and
                            to our relations with Japan in particular. It is trite to say—but all
                            too often the fact is overlooked—that in our democratic system the
                            policies and measures of our Government reflect, and inevitably must
                            reflect, public opinion. If therefore in any given case or situation we
                            search for the underlying causation of American policy, or of any
                            specific measure or series of measures taken by our Government, we must
                            first try to analyze the state of public opinion in the United States
                            and the developments which have induced that state of public opinion,
                            factors which in turn have given rise to some specific policy or some
                            specific measure or measures of our Government. In this connection I
                            have not for a moment lost sight of the force of public opinion in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Obviously American public opinion is frequently divided; seldom is it
                            unanimous. In the face of a divided public opinion, the Government must
                            choose between acting according to its judgment as to what will best
                            serve the interests of the country and withholding action altogether.
                            But when public opinion is unanimous, or nearly unanimous, then
                            governmental policy and action must and will reflect the opinion and
                            wishes of the people as a whole. For the American Government is the
                            servant of the American people. American public opinion with regard to
                            recent and current developments in the Far East is today very nearly
                            unanimous, and that opinion is based not on mere hearsay or on
                            propaganda but on facts.</p>
                        <p>Among the conditions existing in the United States which impress me more
                            and more vividly each time I return to my country are, first, the
                            freedom which prevails in public discussion, and second, the demand for
                            knowledge of facts and the intelligent appraisal of those facts by men
                            and women in every walk of life. Especially is this true today in regard
                            to foreign affairs. It is not alone the Government official or the
                            student or the business man or the manufacturer or the financier who
                            keeps his finger on the pulse of our foreign relations. This
                            interest—and it is a keen, living interest—extends to the masses—the
                            factory hand, the servant in the house, the taxi driver in the street.
                            In the past few months at home I have been immensely impressed by the
                            intelligent grasp by people in every <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23"
                                facs="0089"/>quarter of what is going on in every corner of the
                            world. I have been drawn into discussion of foreign affairs not only by
                            men and women in important and influential positions but by travelers in
                            the smoking compartment of railroad trains, by the stewards in
                            airplanes, by the men and women behind the counters in the stores and
                            shops, by the attendants at gasoline stations, by the drivers of taxis
                            who were taking me to some destination. And what impressed me most was
                            that these people not only knew what was going on abroad but had formed
                            their own individual opinions of those events and of what the United
                            States should or should not do about it. Those people, mostly, are
                            widely read. My chiropodist, when I entered his room, was reading an
                            important book on Japan, and we discussed that book throughout the
                            session. A farmer in the small New England village where we live lent me
                            another recent book on Japan. In the many talks which I had with many,
                            many people, I received the distinct impression that those people are
                            sufficiently well-informed and sufficiently wide-awake to distinguish
                            between fact and propaganda. I do not suppose that any country in the
                            world is better served today, by press and radio, with accurate foreign
                            information than is the United States. In every country there are of
                            course certain elements of the press inclined toward sensationalism, but
                            the vast majority of the American people today read and demand the
                            despatches and comments of correspondents and commentators of proved
                            reliability for accurate reporting. Propaganda not based on fact, or
                            distorting fact, is anathema to the average American. And the senseless
                            propaganda with which foreign countries sometimes try to influence
                            public opinion in our country does the countries of its origin and the
                            interests of those countries far more harm than good. The average
                            American, knowing the facts, sees through it and will have none of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Here, then, is the stuff of which public opinion in the United States is
                            built. It is only through such individual contacts as I enjoyed this
                            summer that one comes to appreciate the tremendous force of public
                            opinion in our country and to realize its fabric and its power. When
                            such opinion tends toward unanimity in any given issue, it is a force to
                            be reckoned with, a force which the Government cannot possibly overlook
                            and will not fail to reflect in its policies and actions.</p>
                        <p>What am I to say to you today? Would it be the act of a friend of Japan,
                            a friend of the members of this Society, would it be in the interests of
                            Japanese-American relations which this Society steadily labors to build
                            up and improve, if I were to misstate the truth or try to obscure it by
                            painting an inaccurate picture of my observations at home? If an
                            Ambassador is in effect an interpreter, mustn’t <pb n="24"
                                xml:id="pg_24" facs="0090"/>he interpret correctly on the basis of
                            facts known to him? And on returning from a long stay in America, would
                            it not insult your intelligence if I were to talk of trivialities? I
                            suppose that there is not a person here who does not know that American
                            public opinion strongly resents some of the things that Japan’s armed
                            forces are doing in China today, including actions against American
                            rights and legitimate interests in China. On that subject public opinion
                            in the United States is unanimous. And, mind you, I know whereof I
                            speak, from personal talks with a very large number of people in diverse
                            walks of life throughout our country, constituting a reliable
                            cross-section of the American public.</p>
                        <p>If we then accept as a regrettable fact this state of American public
                            opinion, and we must accept it as a fact, then isn’t it from every point
                            of view, especially from the point of view of statesmanship, reasonable
                            and logical that we should in all frankness examine the basic causes of
                            that state of public opinion? I know those causes in general and in
                            detail. It would be harmful to overlook them. I earnestly believe that
                            those causes must be removed and that by their removal only constructive
                            good can come to both our nations. The attainment of such mutually
                            constructive good, needless to say, is and has been and always will be
                            the fundamental purpose of my ambassadorship to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Before I left for America last May a Japanese friend of mine begged me to
                            tell my friends in America the situation in Japanese-American relations
                            as he conceived it. It ran somewhat as follows:</p>
                        <p>American rights and interests in China are suffering some minor and
                            unimportant inconveniences in China as a result of Japanese military
                            operations; the Japanese military take every possible precaution to
                            avoid inconvenience to American interests; reports published in the
                            United States in regard to damage to American interests by the Japanese
                            in China are intentionally exaggerated in order to inflame the American
                            people against Japan; in large measure those activities of the Japanese
                            to which Americans object are the result of differences in customs,
                            differences in language, and a legalistic attitude which has been
                            adopted by the United States; the attitude of the Government of the
                            United States in regard to impairment of American rights and interests
                            in the Japanese-occupied areas of China is in large part due to internal
                            political conditions in the United States; in the near future the
                            situation in the occupied areas of China will be so improved that the
                            United States will no longer have any cause for complaint. That was the
                            point of view of my Japanese friend.</p>
                        <p>Alas, the truth is far otherwise. The facts, as they exist, are
                            accurately known by the American Government. They are likewise known by
                            the American people, and in the interests of the future relations <pb
                                n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0091"/>between Japan and the United
                            States those facts must be faced. Only through consideration of those
                            facts can the present attitude of the American Government and people
                            toward Japan be understood; only through consideration of those facts,
                            and through constructive steps to alter those facts, can
                            Japanese-American relations be improved. Those relations <hi
                                rend="italic">must</hi> be improved.</p>
                        <p>Having said all this I do not propose today to deal in detail with the
                            causations which have brought about that feeling in my country. This is
                            not the occasion to enter any “bill of particulars.” Those facts, those
                            difficulties between our nations, are matters for consideration by the
                            two Governments; indeed, some of them are matters which I have been
                            discussing with the Japanese Government during the past two years, and I
                            shall continue to approach these matters. But I believe that the broad
                            outline of those facts and difficulties are known to you. Some of those
                            difficulties are serious.</p>
                        <p>Now many of you who are listening to me may well be thinking: “There are
                            two sides to every picture; we in Japan also have our public opinion to
                            consider.” Granted. In America, as I have already said, I did my best to
                            show various angles of the Japanese point of view. But here in Japan I
                            shall try to show the American point of view. Without careful
                            consideration of both points of view we can get nowhere in building up
                            good relations. I wish you could realize how intensely I wish for that
                            most desirable end and how deeply I desire, by pure objectivity, to
                            contribute to a successful outcome. Let me therefore try to remove a few
                            utterly fallacious conceptions of the American attitude as I think they
                            exist in Japan today.</p>
                        <p>One of these fallacies is that the American approach to affairs in East
                            Asia is bound by a purely “legalistic” attitude, a conception which
                            widely prevails in this country today. What is meant by a “legalistic”
                            attitude? If we mean respect for treaties, official commitments,
                            international law, yes; that respect is and always will be one of the
                            cardinal principles of American policy. But the very term “a legalistic
                            attitude”, as it has often been used in my hearing in Japan, seems to
                            imply a position where one cannot see the woods for the trees, where
                            one’s vision of higher and broader concepts is stultified. Let me
                            therefore touch briefly on a few of the cardinal principles of American
                            policy and objectives, moulded to meet the requirements of modern life,
                            which, it is true, are fundamentally based upon but which seem to me far
                            to transcend any purely “legalistic” approach to world affairs.</p>
                        <p>The American people aspire to relations of peace with every country and
                            between all countries. We have no monopoly on this desire for peace, but
                            we have a very definite conviction that the sort of peace which,
                            throughout history, has been merely an interlude between wars is not an
                            environment in which world civilization can be stably developed <pb
                                n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0092"/>or, perhaps, can even be
                            preserved. We believe that international peace is dependent on what our
                            Secretary of State has characterized as “orderly processes” in
                            international dealing.</p>
                        <p>The American people desire to respect the sovereign rights of other
                            people and to have their own sovereign rights equally respected. We have
                            found by experience that the successful approach to the resolving of
                            international disputes lies not so much in merely abstaining from the
                            use of force as in abstaining from any thought of the use, immediately
                            or eventually, of the methods of force. Let cynics look about them and
                            contemplate the consequences of resort to menacing demands as a process
                            in the conduct of international relations! Is it being purely
                            “legalistic” to put to wise and practical use the finer instincts common
                            to all mankind?</p>
                        <p>The American people believe that the day is past when wars can be
                            confined in their effects to the combatant nations. When national
                            economies were based upon agriculture and handcraft, nations were to a
                            large extent self-sufficient; they lived primarily on the things which
                            they themselves grew or produced. That is not the case today. Nations
                            are now increasingly dependent on others both for commodities which they
                            do not produce themselves and for the disposal of the things which they
                            produce in excess. The highly complex system of exchange of goods has
                            been evolved by reason of each nation’s being able to extract from the
                            ground or to manufacture certain commodities more efficiently or
                            economically than others. Each contributes to the common good the fruits
                            of its handiwork and the bounties of nature. It is this system of
                            exchange which has not only raised the standard of living everywhere but
                            has made it possible for two or even three persons to live in comfort
                            where but one had lived in discomfort under a simple self-contained
                            economy. Not only the benefits of our advanced civilization but the very
                            existence of most of us depends on maintaining in equilibrium a
                            delicately balanced and complex world economy. Wars are not only
                            destructive of the wealth, ‘both human and material, of combatants, but
                            they disturb the fine adjustments of world economy. Conflict between
                            nations is therefore a matter of concern to all the other nations. Is
                            there then any stultification through “legalistic” concepts when we
                            practice ourselves and urge upon others the resolving of international
                            disputes by orderly processes, even if it were only in the interests of
                            world economy? How, except on the basis of law and order, can these
                            various concepts in international dealing be secured?</p>
                        <p>The American people believe in equality of commercial opportunity. There
                            is probably no nation which has not at one time or other invoked it.
                            Even Japan, where American insistence on the open door is cited as the
                            supreme manifestation of what is characterized as a “legalistic” <pb
                                n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0093"/>American attitude—even Japan, I
                            say—has insisted upon and has received the benefits of the open door in
                            areas other than China, where, we are told, the principle is
                            inapplicable except in a truncated and emasculated form. That highly
                            complicated system of world economy of which I have just spoken is
                            postulated upon the ability of nations to buy and sell where they please
                            under conditions of free competition—conditions which cannot exist in
                            areas where preemptive rights are claimed and asserted on behalf of
                            nationals of one particular country.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say that the thoughts which I have just expressed are of
                            universal applicability.</p>
                        <p>Another common fallacy which I am constrained to mention is the charge
                            that the American Government and people do not understand “the new order
                            in East Asia”. Forgive me if I very respectfully take issue with that
                            conception. The American Government and people understand what is meant
                            by the “new order in East Asia” precisely as clearly as it is understood
                            in Japan. The “new order in East Asia” has been officially defined in
                            Japan as an order of security, stability and progress. The American
                            Government and people earnestly desire security, stability and progress
                            not only for themselves but for all other nations in every quarter of
                            the world. But the new order in East Asia has appeared to include, among
                            other things, depriving Americans of their long established rights in
                            China, and to this the American people are opposed.</p>
                        <p>There’s the story. It is probable that many of you are not aware of the
                            increasing extent to which the people of the United States resent the
                            methods which the Japanese armed forces are employing in China today and
                            what appear to be their objectives. In saying this, I do not wish for
                            one moment to imply that the American people have forgotten the
                            long-time friendship which has existed between the people of my country
                            and the people of Japan. But the American people have been profoundly
                            shocked over the widespread use of bombing in China, not only on grounds
                            of humanity but also on grounds of the direct menace to American lives
                            and property accompanied by the loss of American life and the crippling
                            of American citizens; they regard with growing seriousness the violation
                            of and interference with American rights by the Japanese armed forces in
                            China in disregard of treaties and agreements entered into by the United
                            States and Japan and treaties and agreements entered into by several
                            nations, including Japan. The American people know that those treaties
                            and agreements were entered into voluntarily by Japan and that the
                            provisions of those treaties and agreements constituted a practical
                            arrangement for safeguarding—for the benefit of all—the correlated
                            principles of national sovereignty and of equality of economic
                            opportunity. The principle of equality of economic opportunity <pb
                                n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0094"/>is one to which over a long
                            period and on many occasions Japan has given definite approval and upon
                            which Japan has frequently insisted. Not only are the American people
                            perturbed over their being arbitrarily deprived of long-established
                            rights, including those of equal opportunity and fair treatment, but
                            they feel that the present trend in the Far East if continued will be
                            destructive of the hopes which they sincerely cherish of the development
                            of an orderly world. American rights and interests in China are being
                            impaired or destroyed by the policies and actions of the Japanese
                            authorities in China. American property is being damaged or destroyed;
                            American nationals are being endangered and subjected to indignities. If
                            I felt in a position to set forth all the facts in detail today, you
                            would, without any question, appreciate the soundness and full
                            justification of the American attitude. Perhaps you will also understand
                            why I wish today to exercise restraint.</p>
                        <p>In short, the American people, from all the thoroughly reliable evidence
                            that comes to them, have good reason to believe that an effort is being
                            made to establish control, in Japan’s own interest, of large areas on
                            the continent of Asia and to impose upon those areas a system of closed
                            economy. It is this thought, added to the effect of the bombings, the
                            indignities, the manifold interference with American rights, that
                            accounts for the attitude of the American people toward Japan today. For
                            my part I will say this. It is my belief, and the belief of the American
                            Government and people, that the many things injurious to the United
                            States which have been done and are being done by Japanese agencies are
                                <hi rend="italic">wholly needless</hi>. We believe that real
                            security and stability in the Far East could be attained without running
                            counter to any American rights whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have tried to give an accurate
                            interpretation of American public opinion, most carefully studied and
                            analyzed by me while at home. The traditional friendship between our two
                            nations is far too precious a thing to be either inadvertently or
                            deliberately impaired. It seems to me logical that from every point of
                            view—economic, financial, commercial, in the interests of business,
                            travel, science, culture and sentiment—Japan and the United States
                            forever should be mutually considerate friends. In the family of
                            nations, as between and among brothers, there arise inevitable
                            controversies, but again and again the United States has demonstrated
                            its practical sympathy and desire to be helpful toward Japan in
                            difficult times and moments, its admiration of Japan’s achievements, its
                            earnest desire for mutually helpful relations.</p>
                        <p>Please do not misconstrue or misinterpret the attitude which has prompted
                            me to speak in the utmost frankness today. I am moved first of all by
                            love of my own country and my devotion to its interest: <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0095"/>but I am also moved by very deep
                            affection for Japan and by sincere conviction that the real interests,
                            the fundamental and abiding interests of both countries, call for
                            harmony of thought and action in our relationships. Those who know my
                            sentiments for Japan, developed in happy contacts during the seven years
                            in which I have lived here among you, will realize, I am sure, that my
                            words and my actions are those of a true friend.</p>
                        <p>One Japanese newspaper queried, on my return from America, whether I had
                            concealed in my bosom a dagger or a dove. Let me answer that query. I
                            have nothing concealed in my bosom except the desire to work with all my
                            mind, with all my heart and with all my strength for Japanese-American
                            friendship.</p>
                        <p>Today I have stated certain facts, straightforwardly and objectively. But
                            I am also making a plea for sympathetic understanding in the interests
                            of the old, enduring friendship between our two great nations. In a
                            world of chaos I plead for stability, now and in the long future, in a
                            relationship which, <hi rend="italic">if it can he preserved</hi>, can
                            bring only good to Japan and to the United States of America.</p>

                                printed.</note> Yakichiro Suma, newly appointed Foreign Office
                            spokesman and formerly Counselor in Washington, gave a long interview to
                            the foreign correspondents today in regard to Japanese-American
                            relations. While these correspondents are understood to have cabled the
                            significant portions thereof to their papers in the United States, in
                            view of Mr. Suma’s position, it is believed that the Department may wish
                            to have the contents of his interview as reported here which were
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Question: Are you handling Ambassador Grew’s address given at the
                                    Imperial Hotel as an official protest or have you received an
                                    official protest with similar contents?</p>
                                <p>Answer: We do not regard it as an official protest nor have we
                                    received such an official protest.</p>
                                <p>Question: What is Japan’s view in regard to that speech?</p>
                                <p>Answer: For a diplomat to report accurately the feeling of his
                                    country to the country to which he is accredited takes an
                                    unusual amount of courage and I am deeply impressed with Mr.
                                    Grew’s action. However, it is difficult to agree with the
                                    Ambassador’s statement that the American public has a correct
                                    grasp of the situation in East Asia. From my own experiences in
                                    America there has <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0096"/>been
                                    deplorable ignorance among the people concerning conditions in
                                    the Far East. Recently I read Hugh Wilson’s book entitled
                                    “Memoirs of a Diplomat” in which he states that as the American
                                    people are geographically too well blessed, public opinion in
                                    regard to foreign affairs is not of a serious character and I am
                                    in agreement with him. American views with regard to the Far
                                    East are completely directed by emotion. The American Government
                                    and people should pay full attention to actual facts of the
                                    situation in East Asia and their opinion should be more
                                    constructive and practical.</p>
                                <p>Question: As the treaty expires next January,<note n="18"
                                        xml:id="d13fn18">See <ref target="#pg_189">pp. 189</ref>
                                        ff.</note> the view is strong here United States will cease
                                    buying Japanese silk and Japan will cease buying American
                                    cotton. What do you think of that?</p>
                                <p>Answer: I heard this sort of view quite often while in the United
                                    States. I even heard that all trade relations would cease.
                                    However, this would amount to aggressive action against Japan
                                    and as it would not bring the result desired by the United
                                    States the majority of opinion inclined to the view that it
                                    could be spoken of lightly. As Walter Lippmann has said, the
                                    responsibility for the adjustment of Japanese-American relations
                                    rests not only with Japan; the United States also must exert
                                    every effort to observe the road to adjustment.</p>
                                <p>Question: What do you think about the rumor that a four-power
                                    conference including Japan, England, France and the United
                                    States will be held to discuss the question of opening the
                                    Yangtze River to navigation.</p>
                                <p>Answer: That is purely conjecture. France and England would not
                                    have to be mentioned. If necessary, discussions could be carried
                                    on with the United States. In any case the question of opening
                                    the Yangtze to navigation is not to be dismissed lightly.</p>

                        <p>1. According to the press the Foreign Minister made the following
                            statement in regard to Japanese-American relations at yesterday’s
                            Cabinet meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Recent opinion in the United States toward the China affair,
                                    both official and unofficial, is extremely unfavorable and in
                                    the course of the coming negotiations looking toward the
                                    adjustment of Japanese-American relations it is doubtful whether

                                    that with the expiration on January 25 next year of the Treaty
                                    of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the United States,
                                    Japanese-American relations may reach the worst state possible
                                    and must take into consideration at once counter-measures with
                                    respect to imports and exports, plans for commodity mobilization
                                    and similar problems.”</p>

                        <p>I held today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the first important
                            conversation since returning from leave of absence, an interview which
                            had been delayed owing to the recent troubles in the Foreign Office. Our
                            conversation today lasted an hour. I spoke to the Minister in English
                            but he himself spoke through Mr. Okumura, as interpreter.</p>
                        <p>The Minister opened the conversation by expressing regrets for the delay
                            in receiving me on the ground that he had only recently taken office and
                            had had to familiarize himself with some of the problems thereof. He
                            said he knew what I had done during the past seven years in the
                            interests of Japanese-American relations and of the report of my recent
                            visit in the United States as expressed in my speech of October 19
                            before the America-Japan Society. He said that he fully shares my desire
                            for better relations between our two countries. Both sides must have
                            full appreciation of the standpoint and views of each other, an action
                            which of course applies to all international relations. Both Japan and
                            the United States are stabilizing factors in their respective regions
                            and both wish to remain away from the disastrous effects of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Minister referred to my last brief talk with him and said he fully
                            shared my views that informal conversations were better and more
                            effective than the writing of official documents. I said immediately
                            that this represented my own feeling as I had already told him but of
                            course he must realize that notes sometimes had to be written apart from
                            conversations and that I might still have to write many notes in future
                            but that I would always try to limit them to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that our views were already partially known to him
                            through the various notes we had written to his predecessors and from my
                            speech before the America-Japan Society but that he would now be glad to
                            listen to what I had to say.</p>

                        <p>In opening my side of the conversation I said that wishing to present the
                            American point of view as clearly and concretely as possible I had
                            prepared three manuscripts which I would leave with the Minister not as
                            official documents but as informal papers and I requested him to be good
                            enough to read them carefully because they would give him in fairly
                            concentrated form a clear picture of the situation as its exists between
                            our two countries. These manuscripts are:<note n="20" xml:id="d15fn20"

                        <p>With regard to the first paper, I said that this list does not
                            necessarily present a complete accounting of instances in which American
                            citizens or American rights or interests have suffered interference,
                            discrimination, indignities or damage as a result of Japanese
                            activities. The recapitulation shows that of 382 written representations
                            made, 256 have not been acknowledged. I pointed out to the Minister that
                            not all or many of the 116 replies received could be regarded by us as
                            satisfactory. In the case of 10 representations, replies were not
                            necessarily required.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second paper, I asked the Minister to observe the
                            specific assurances which had been given me by his predecessors that
                            American rights and interests in China would be respected, assurances
                            which are not being carried out in practice.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the third paper, I said that the material therein included
                            embraced statements which were contained in the original draft of my
                            speech before the American-Japan Society on October 19 but that I had
                            omitted those statements from the speech with a view to avoiding any
                            possible embarrassment to His Excellency or to the Japanese Government.
                            Those statements were however important as specifying and clarifying
                            some of the difficulties existing between the United States and Japan. I
                            also pointed out that I had carefully avoided giving to the press the
                            text of the speech as actually delivered until the Foreign Office itself
                            had asked me to release the text to the press. The Minister acknowledged
                            this point with a smile and a nod.</p>
                        <p>I then said that in my opinion the coming months might be critical in
                            Japanese-American relations. There is at present in the United <pb
                                n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0099"/>States a strong demand for an
                            embargo against Japan when our Treaty of 1911 expires next winter and it
                            is my earnest hope that steps will be taken by Japan which will relieve
                            this pressure of public opinion. I said that I desired to make it
                            perfectly clear that I was presenting certain objective facts and that
                            no other implication should be drawn from my remarks. I was not used to
                            what might be called the old-school diplomacy and believed that perfect
                            frankness in such conversations as the present one was highly desirable
                            in the interests of both sides. (Neither the substance nor the tone of
                            my remarks conveyed any threat whatsoever and there was no indication
                            that the Minister took my remarks as a threat). I said that certain
                            fundamental differences between our two countries would presumably some
                            day have to be faced but I felt that the first thing to do was to clear
                            the atmosphere. For this purpose, in my opinion, two things were
                            necessary: first, cessation of the bombings, indignities and more
                            flagrant interferences with American rights and interests in China which
                            were causes of current irritation in the United States; second, some
                            step or steps of a positive nature which would convince the American
                            Government and people by concrete evidence that Japan intends to improve
                            our relations. In this connection I mentioned the opening of the Yangtze
                            River to American navigation as the sort of positive step I had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>In reply to this presentation the Minister said that there appears to be
                            a misunderstanding on the part of the United States that Japan intends
                            to drive American interests out of China. I replied that quite apart
                            from any future intention the fact remains that American interests are
                            being driven out of China. The Minister observed that American
                            assistance in the reconstruction of China is going to be absolutely
                            indispensable.</p>
                        <p>The Minister requested us to bear in mind the following points: <list>
                                <label><hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</label>
                                <item>Japan is engaged in warfare on a scale unprecedented in
                                    Japanese history and great stakes including the expense of many
                                    lives and much treasure are involved. Japan’s paramount object
                                    is to convert an anti-Japanese China into a China sympathetic to
                                    Japan. In the Minister’s personal opinion Japan and China must
                                    live in good neighborhood and prosper in a common way. If third
                                    powers help China to antagonize Japan, stabilization will be
                                    impossible.</item>
                                <label><hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</label>
                                <item>The Minister expressed the hope that the United States will
                                    give better appreciation of the extent to which the Japanese
                                    authorities in China are endeavoring to protect American
                                    property in China. They are doing their best under abnormal and
                                    difficult conditions. The United States is evidently not
                                    satisfied but the Minister hopes to give concrete facts of the
                                    care taken. This referred to bombings and other encroachments. I
                                    mentioned the subject of Japanese monopolies. The Minister said
                                    he thought that such monopolies were set up purely for purposes
                                    of price control.</item>

                        <p>At the end of the conversation the Minister said that he was now
                            discussing these various matters with his colleagues in the Cabinet and
                            with the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>We then agreed on a communiqué to the Japanese press stating simply in
                            effect that we had explored the field of Japanese-American relations in
                            a mutually constructive spirit. He however authorized me to tell the
                            American press correspondents that I had presented the American point of
                            view in general and in detail. This was done.</p>
                        <p>At no point in the conversation was the question of negotiating a new
                            treaty between the United States and Japan touched upon either by the
                            Minister or myself.</p>
                        <p>The atmosphere of the conversation was excellent and at the end of the
                            official exchanges of views the Minister and I indulged in pleasant
                            personal reminiscences.</p>

                            Department informed the correspondents that the American Ambassador to
                            Japan has reported by telegraph that his talk with the Foreign Minister
                            today dealt with objective facts and that he wished to say categorically
                            that no threats of economic sanctions were made either in the substance

                            <item>On October 11 the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, when calling
                                on an officer of the Department, expressed the opinion that a
                                central regime would be set up very soon under Wang Ching-wei;<note

                                that it would be a fully independent and well-established
                                government; but that it would probably <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"
                                    facs="0101"/>be necessary, from the point of view of combating
                                communist activities, for Japanese forces to remain at certain
                                points in China for a period of time. On November 7, during a call
                                on another officer of the Department, the Counselor again referred
                                to the proposed regime, stating that the Japanese placed great hopes
                                in its establishment; that the Japanese expected the regime to
                                become a stable and independent one like “Manchukuo”; that he did
                                not expect the Japanese to raise questions of <hi rend="italic">de

                                other powers but it was hoped that, as a solution to many
                                difficulties, foreign governments would deal and cooperate with the
                                new regime. In regard to the question of Japanese troops, the
                                Counselor stated that it was hoped that the time would come when
                                they could withdraw but that of course was a very difficult
                                question.</item>

                            <item>It is our opinion that the proposed regime, if set up, would be a
                                purely artificial creation, and that its existence would depend upon
                                Japanese armed support; that the regime would lack any spontaneous
                                or genuine broad support on the part of the Chinese public; and that
                                it would be designed primarily to serve the special purposes of
                                Japan which, as in the case of the regimes established during recent
                                years under Japanese auspices in Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, at
                                Peiping and at Nanking, would result in depriving the people and the
                                Government of the United States, and the people and governments of
                                other third countries, of long-established rights of equal
                                opportunity and fair treatment in China which are legally and justly
                                theirs. We could not regard the setting up of such a regime as
                                evidence of a disposition on Japan’s part to pursue a course in and
                                with regard to China which would be in accord with fundamental
                                principles and policies in which this Government believes. The
                                setting up of such a regime would therefore in our opinion serve to
                                render more difficult rather than to facilitate an adjustment of
                                American-Japanese relations.</item>

                            regime in China, and he said that the Government expected to follow in

                            would eventually assimilate the Chungking Government, thus obviating any
                            need for Japan to have any future dealings with the latter. He
                            reiterated the Japanese contention that North China and Inner Mongolia
                            should be a special zone for Japan, both politically and economically,
                            and that Japan would show more concern over those areas than over any
                            other part of China. He said that Japan probably would conclude an
                            anti-Comintern pact with reborn China along the lines of the
                            Japanese-German-Italian anti-Comintern accord,<note n="23a"

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called this afternoon to see me at his request
                            and in view of the return of the Secretary of State the Ambassador was
                            received by the Secretary in the latter’s office.</p>
                        <p>After the customary preliminary exchanges of courtesies the Secretary
                            waited for the Ambassador to commence the conversation. The Ambassador
                            stated that he was calling solely of his own initiative and not by
                            instruction of his Government and that the purpose of his call was to
                            undertake a general exchange of views in as much as the Ambassador
                            believed that there was considerable, and perhaps increasing,
                            misunderstanding on the part of public opinion in the United States of
                            the course pursued by Japan in China and of the policy of the Japanese
                            Government in its relations with China. The Ambassador stated that the
                            two principles of Japanese policy towards China were, first, the desire
                            of Japan to guard against the spirit of communism in China, and second,
                            the need of Japan to assure herself of satisfactory economic relations
                            between China and Japan. The Ambassador went on to say that the
                            Government of Japan had made every effort to satisfy these two
                            objectives through negotiations with the government of General Chiang
                            Kai Shek, but that unfortunately negotiations had proved fruitless and
                            there had arisen the major conflict now going on between Japan and
                            China. As a result of this conflict many areas in China were under the
                            occupation of the Japanese Army and as a result of this situation
                            “inconvenience”, as the Ambassador phrased it, had resulted to American
                            nationals and to American business interests. At the same time, the
                            Japanese Government had given the most positive <pb n="37"
                                xml:id="pg_37" facs="0103"/>instructions to its military authorities
                            in China that such impediments to American nationals and business
                            interests should be avoided in so far as might be possible and it was
                            the belief of the Government of Japan that as soon as hostilities ceased
                            these obstacles to American nationals and commercial interests could be
                            immediately lessened and eventually removed. The Ambassador stated that
                            the Government of Japan abided by the principles of the Open Door in
                            China and that the impediments and prejudices from which American
                            nationals and business interests in China were now suffering should be
                            regarded as only temporary in character.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he realized that relations between Japan and the
                            United States were somewhat “strained” and that it was his earnest
                            desire as Ambassador here to do everything that might be possible to
                            improve relations, but that he did not feel that a satisfactory result
                            in this sense could be obtained if the two governments devoted
                            themselves to a discussion of “principles”. On the contrary he felt that
                            an effort should be made to discuss a practical solution of the problems
                            which had arisen. The Ambassador then went on to say that the liberal
                            elements in Japan as well as the business interests in Japan were
                            sincerely friendly to the people of the United States and earnestly
                            desired an improvement in relations between the two countries, but that
                            if no such improvement were forthcoming they would unquestionably become
                            “disappointed”; and if no means of obtaining economic cooperation from
                            the United States were found, these elements in Japan would possibly
                            find it necessary to look elsewhere for these means of economic
                            cooperation, and that arrangements between Japan and Soviet Russia for
                            economic cooperation might consequently be the inevitable result.</p>
                        <p>When the Ambassador had concluded, the Secretary replied by saying that
                            he, of course, was confident of the Ambassador’s individual desire to
                            bring back relations between the two countries to that standard of
                            friendship which the two peoples had enjoyed for a period of two
                            generations. He said that he felt sure that the Japanese Government must
                            appreciate that no country had pursued a policy of greater friendship
                            towards Japan than the United States, and that while at times both
                            Governments felt that developments had occurred which were not to their
                            liking, he nevertheless believed that the Japanese people must
                            appreciate the fact that the Government of the United States had no
                            ambitions for territorial expansion in the Far East, nor was it pursuing
                            any policy actuated by selfish motives which could be construed as
                            prejudicial to Japan. He said that the innumerable incidents involving
                            the infringement of the rights of the United States in China and the
                            legitimate treaty interests of American nationals in China were a matter
                            of legitimate concern to the American people <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38"
                                facs="0104"/>and that this Government felt that this condition could
                            not go on for an indefinite period. The Secretary stated that it was
                            particularly disappointing to this Government, when it called attention
                            to these infringements of its legitimate rights and of the interests of
                            its nationals in China, to obtain the impression from the Japanese
                            Government that such action on our part was likely to create a feeling
                            on the part of the Japanese people that they wished to replace their
                            relations with the United States by closer relations with another power.
                            The Secretary added that whatever surprise might be created in the
                            United States by the development of closer relations between Japan and
                            another power, it would not be equivalent to the surprise which was
                            created when Hitler entered into closer relations with that same foreign
                                power.<note n="23b" xml:id="d19fn23b">For text of the German-Soviet

                        <p>The Ambassador was much taken aback with this remark, of which he
                            undoubtedly gained the full significance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether it was correct that Japan had some
                            800,000 troops now engaged in hostilities in China. The Ambassador
                            replied that he was not precisely informed on that point, but that he
                            thought that if the Secretary referred to the troops stationed in
                            Manchuria as well as in China proper, that might be a correct
                            estimate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired what was the intention of the Japanese
                            Government with regard to that number of troops in China. The Ambassador
                            replied that after hostilities had ceased undoubtedly the major part of
                            the troops would be removed. The Ambassador went on to say that after
                            the kidnapping of General Chiang Kai Shek<note n="23c" xml:id="d19fn23c"
                                >In December 1935, during an inspection trip in Shensi
                                Province.</note> a deal had been made by his wife and other friends
                            with the communist leaders in China so that General Chiang would no
                            longer attack the communists and would attack Japan, and that it was for
                            that reason that Japan found it impossible to negotiate with General
                            Chiang’s government. He said, however, that the Japanese Government
                            believed that a new Chinese Government would soon be installed with
                            which the Japanese Government could undertake negotiations providing for
                            settlement of all the matters at issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether the retention of Japanese troops in China
                            by Japan would be for the purpose of bolstering up that government and
                            maintaining it in power. The Ambassador answered that undoubtedly
                            Japanese troops would be maintained after the creation of this new
                            Chinese government for a sufficient time in order to obtain assurance
                            that order would be maintained, et cetera, but that eventually the
                            number left would be very small.</p>
                        <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether the retention of Japanese troops in
                            China would mean that the same measures of discrimination against
                            American trade, exchange control, et cetera, would likewise be kept in
                            force because of the continued presence of Japanese troops in China. The
                            Ambassador answered that while the war was being waged in China by Japan
                            measures such as the imposition of exchange control, et cetera, were
                            required in order to make it possible for the Japanese forces to obtain
                            food supplies, clothing, et cetera, but that after hostilities had
                            ceased these measures would be greatly relaxed and the “inconvenience”
                            to American interests would be correspondingly diminished.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired whether this Government was to take as
                            accurate the interpretations given to the “new order in the East”
                            enunciated by Japanese statesmen in Japan. The Ambassador replied that
                            he believed that the interpretation given by Prince Konoye was to be
                            regarded as accurate, as were the bases for peace with China enunciated
                            by Prince Konoye in December 1938. The Secretary stated that the
                            implications of such interpretations of the new order in the East were
                            necessarily of very great concern to the American public because of the
                            impressions thereby created that the rights of the United States in
                            China and the rights and interests of its nationals were to be
                            determined as the Japanese Government saw fit and not as treaties and
                            international law laid them down.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador again referred to the belief he had expressed before that
                            a satisfactory solution of these problems could be found in a practical
                            way provided the two Governments did not limit themselves to a
                            consideration of principles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then stated that if that was the case, it seemed to him
                            that the first move must legitimately and logically come from the
                            Japanese Government in order that this Government might be advised as to
                            the practical manner in which the Japanese Government proposed to remove
                            the obstacles to friendly relations between the two Governments in
                            accordance with the Ambassador’s expressed desire. It was made very
                            clear to the Ambassador that this Government expected the Japanese
                            Government to present concrete evidence of the manner in which the
                            legitimate grounds for complaint on the part of this Government were to
                            be removed and that this Government did not feel called upon to take the
                            initiative in making any suggestions of this character.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded the conversation by telling the Ambassador that
                            he should feel free to come in to see him at any time should he have any
                            suggestions of this character to offer.</p>

                        <p>656. My 655, December 4, 8 p.m.<note n="25" xml:id="d20fn25">Not
                                printed.</note> Following is the memorandum of my conversation with
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs today which lasted for one hour and a
                            half. In view of the probability of inaccurate press speculation it
                            seems preferable to send this telegram direct to Washington rather than
                            via naval radio through Shanghai. Owing to the importance of the subject
                            and in order adequately to convey the tone of the Minister’s remarks I
                            do not feel justified in curtailing this long telegram.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he was glad to resume our talks, the last of which
                            had occurred on November 4, and that he was sorry for the delay in
                            continuing them. He said that he had carefully studied the statements
                            which I had made at our last meeting as well as the documents left with
                            him. He considered very valuable the suggestions which I had made to him
                            with regard to the importance of furnishing direct evidence of the
                            intention of the Japanese authorities to put an end to the bombings of
                            American property, the insults to American citizens and the
                            encroachments on American commercial activities in China which must be
                            removed. Admiral Nomura realizes that the impression exists in the
                            United States that these various acts have been deliberate and that
                            there is an intention on the part of the Japanese authorities to expel
                            American interests from China, He desired to give me categorical
                            assurances that such an impression is a misunderstanding and contrary to
                            fact. Military operations on an unprecedentedly gigantic scale over
                            extensive areas are going on in China and all of the incidents and cases
                            of which we have complained have been accidental. The Japanese forces
                            have been ordered to pay every possible attention in their power to
                            protect and respect American property and citizens in China. The
                            Minister said that he had discussed this matter with his competent
                            colleagues in the Cabinet and he could tell me as a fact that the
                            personnel of the military commands in China has been so arranged as to
                            ensure this protection and respect.</p>
                        <p>The Minister desired to say that such limitations to the commercial
                            activities of Americans in China as have occurred are a result of the
                            military operations including control of the occupied areas, such
                            operations not being consonant with the peaceful enjoyment of ordinary
                            commercial rights. These limitations are however exceptional and <pb
                                n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0107"/>temporary and our rights will be
                            restored when peace comes. It will only lead to misunderstanding and
                            confusion to generalize and to forecast future conditions on the basis
                            of these temporary circumstances.</p>
                        <p>At this point I mentioned some of the different ways in which American
                            commercial rights and interests were being injured including the setting
                            up of monopolies which had resulted in ruining the business of various
                            American interests. It seemed to me difficult to explain these
                            monopolies and other restrictions as due to military necessity. The
                            Minister said that in war time it became necessary to control
                            commodities and that the monopolies and other handicaps could be
                            explained on this basis. I countered, however, with the observation that
                            many of these measures gave the American Government and people the
                            impression that they were intended to be permanent and that I would
                            welcome concrete evidence to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that he desired to repeat the assurances given me
                            by his predecessors that the Japanese forces in China have not the
                            slightest intention to drive out American interests and that they have
                            the strictest orders to the contrary. He said that our commercial
                            problems in China should be dealt with both in Tokyo and in the field
                            and he requested that American officials in the field should keep in
                            close touch with local Japanese officials. The Minister said that the
                            cases both of bombings of American property and insults to American
                            citizens were decreasing. In Pakhoi and Nanning for instance he has
                            heard of no case of the damaging of American property in that area.
                            Briefly, measures were also being taken to facilitate American commerce,
                            as in the case of shipments of wood oil from Hankow and of lace and
                            drawn work from Swatow. The Minister was thus in a position, he says, to
                            point out that positive measures were being taken in line with the
                            valuable suggestions which I had made at our last meeting. He
                            appreciated my honest desire to improve relations and by the way of
                            reciprocating this attitude he was now studying with the proper
                            authorities such measures as could properly be taken.</p>
                        <p>The Minister expressed the regret that while he and I were making joint
                            efforts to improve relations these efforts were being injured by the
                            sometimes too liberal expressions of opinion by important people in the
                            United States, including statements with regard to a possible embargo
                            against Japan.</p>
                        <p>At this point I interpolated some pertinent observations with regard to
                            the freedom of the American press and of public discussion and that we
                            had found by experience that measures to control the utterances of the
                            press or of individuals often defeated their own object by causing an
                            intensification of those utterances. I added that the public statements
                            of individuals outside of the Government even though those individuals
                            might be in close touch with the Government did not necessarily <pb
                                n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0108"/>represent the Government’s views.
                            The Minister smilingly observed that the same situation, especially with
                            regard to the press, obtained also in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that he desired to present certain figures which
                            he thought I would find welcome as meeting some of my representations in
                            our last conference and wait for concrete proposals for the settlement
                            of pending questions. He said that the list of cases which I had
                            presented to him had been carefully analyzed and a résumé drawn up on
                            the basis of available documents. He thereupon handed me an informal
                            document in Japanese which he thought I would probably wish to have
                            translated and he read to me the following résumé:<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d20fn26">Entitled “Table B”; not printed.</note> (<hi

                            acknowledged but the contents dealt with by communication to the

                            or dealt with 8, (4) investigations still going on but not yet answered

                        <p>The Minister expressed regret that some of our representations had not
                            been acknowledged or answered owing to clerical oversight but he could
                            assure me that all of our representations were receiving attention and
                            that the competent officials were seeking solutions.</p>
                        <p>Some cases had been settled or were about to be settled such as the Nyhus
                            case and the cases of bombings around Shanghai and Nanking which
                            amounted to 39.<note n="26a" xml:id="d20fn26a">For details, see <ref

                                    pp. 487</ref> ff.</note> In these cases the investigations had
                            been completed and the Japanese officials were in touch with our own
                            officials in Shanghai with the view to finding solutions. The Minister
                            said that Mr. Yoshizawa<note n="26b" xml:id="d20fn26b">Director of the
                                American Bureau of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                            would explain either to Mr. Dooman or to me the details of the informal
                            document which he had handed to me and would also be glad at all times
                            to discuss pending questions. He said he thought it would be well for us
                            to have periodical and frequent talks with Mr. Yoshizawa and he
                            recommends that the officials of the Foreign Office and the Embassy
                            constitute themselves as a sort of permanent committee to deal with
                            these pending matters. Thus speedy settlement of these questions could
                            be made or agreement reached as to how to solve them and this should
                            lead to more stable relations between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Minister alluded to the press reports that there are over 600 cases
                            awaiting solution. Such incorrect reports mislead the public and injure
                            our relations. He thought it would be useful to publish the actual facts
                            and suggested Mr. Yoshizawa get in touch with us with that end in
                            view.</p>
                        <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0109"/>
                        <p>The Minister said that this completed his official observations and that
                            he would now like to talk “off the record.” With regard to our treaty of
                            commerce and navigation he said that “even if the treaty expires I hope
                            that relations may be maintained in a normal way and that there will be
                            no cause for the people of both countries to get excited about.” Japan’s
                            trade with the United States represented a very large percentage of
                            Japan’s entire trade and if commerce with the United States should be
                            impaired Japan would obviously have to seek other commercial
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] It appeared to me that an implied threat of an
                            understanding with the Soviet Government was contained in the foregoing
                            remark of Nomura and that the remark might be considered as seeking
                            indirectly an opportunity for bringing up the matter of negotiations for
                            a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> or for a new treaty. I therefore
                            took occasion to inform Nomura of the Secretary’s views (expressed on
                            November 24 to Ambassador Horinouchi<note n="27" xml:id="d20fn27">See
                                memorandum by the Under Secretary of State, <hi rend="italic"

                            the consideration that this Government did not feel obligated to assume
                            the initiative in offering for consideration practical measures for
                            removing the impediments to friendly relations between the United States
                            and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon I took up several individual cases with Nomura, as reported
                            separately. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>Mr. Yoshizawa asked whether I would be interested in hearing the report
                            of the Japanese Ambassador at Washington on his last conversation, that
                            of November 24, with the Secretary of State. Upon my reply that I would,
                            Mr. Yoshizawa read the telegraphic report, which followed that of the
                            report received by us from the Department. The former was, however, much
                            longer and gave a more detailed account of the conversation. It was
                            interesting to note that Mr. Horinouchi completely missed the
                            Secretary’s observation <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0110"/>with
                            regard to the lack of surprise which would attend any treaty arrangement
                            between Japan and the Soviet Union: he understood the Secretary to say
                            that the United States would be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> surprised by
                            such an arrangement than it was by the non-aggression treaty between the
                            Soviet Union and Germany.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yoshizawa then referred to the desire expressed by the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs during the course of his conversation on December 4 with
                            the Ambassador, that members of the Foreign Office and of the Embassy
                            meet at frequent intervals to discuss China problems and that they
                            constitute themselves into an informal standing committee. With that
                            statement in mind, Mr. Yoshizawa had asked me to call so that we might
                            informally talk over matters of procedure.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Foreign Office had closely studied the list of “cases”
                            presented by the Ambassador to Admiral Nomura on November 4, and that
                            the position was somewhat more favorable than that indicated by our
                            list. This could be explained largely by the fact that a number of cases
                            had been settled “on the spot”, as he put it, that is, following
                            negotiations in China, without such settlements having been recorded in
                            correspondence between the Embassy and the Foreign Office. The number of
                            cases of bombings, including cases of machinegunning by Japanese
                            airplanes, stands now at 144, and the number of cases of occupation of
                            American properties, destruction, looting, et cetera, at 73. He regarded
                            these two groups of cases as constituting one category.</p>
                        <p>There were then a number of cases and problems with a politico-economic

                        <p rend="flushleft">These were admittedly difficult questions, as military
                            operations, the suppression of financial and other forms of assistance
                            to the Chinese Government, et cetera, had to be considered with a view
                            to terminating the hostilities in China as soon as possible. Given
                            goodwill on both sides, however, he thought that discussions could be
                            carried <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0111"/>on in a constructive
                            spirit and that substantial progress could be made.</p>
                        <p>There were finally the basic and fundamental problems. Obviously there
                            was little that could be done now in the way of examining principles of
                            policy, such as the territorial and administrative integrity of China,
                            but Mr. Yoshizawa hoped that we could put forward our respective views
                            for purposes of clarification. Such clarification would be helpful
                            against the time when conditions would make possible a search for
                            definitive adjustment of views.</p>
                        <p>Having classified the various problems, Mr. Yoshizawa proceeded to
                            discuss measures which might be taken by Japan to meet the American
                            position. He divided these into two categories: negative and positive.
                            The negative measures covered the stopping of action on the part of the
                            Japanese directly injurious to American lives and property, such as
                            bombings, looting, forcible occupation of mission premises, et cetera,
                            and compensation in some form for damage already done. He said that the
                            committee set up to examine claims had completed investigation of 39
                            cases which occurred in the area between Shanghai and Nanking. Mr.
                            Yoshizawa had his assistant bring in the documents, and he showed me the
                            stack of papers about a foot high as evidence of the work which the
                            committee had already done. The committee had recommended the payment in
                            a number of instances of moneys as <hi rend="italic">ex gratia</hi>
                            donations, scaled according to the strength of the evidence of Japanese
                            responsibility for the damage done. These cases would be shortly taken
                            up with the American Consul General at Shanghai with a view to
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yoshizawa said that the plan which he presented about two weeks ago
                            to Admiral Nomura for the conversation with Mr. Grew which eventually
                            took place on December 4 contemplated that the conversation cover only
                            the “negative” measures which Japan could take, but that Admiral Nomura
                            was insistent that indication be given at the same time of the
                            “positive” measures which the Japanese Government was prepared to take
                            to improve or ameliorate conditions in China affecting the exercise by
                            Americans of their rights. He had, however, represented to Admiral
                            Nomura that it was necessary for the Japanese Government to keep its
                            feet on the ground and to await developments which would make possible
                            the implementation of promises to take positive action calculated to
                            improve conditions. The first of these developments must be the setting
                            up of the new central regime under Wang Ching-wei, and that was to take
                            place in the near future. It was his intention, then, to propose a
                            further conversation between Admiral Nomura and Mr. Grew in order that
                            the plan of the Japanese Government for the further meeting of the
                            American position could be presented. Such measures as could be <pb
                                n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0112"/>taken would touch largely on the
                            cases of a politico-economic character above listed as the second
                            category of outstanding questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Yoshizawa then expressed disappointment over the unfavorable
                            publicity in the United States with regard to the steps already taken by
                            the Japanese to improve the situation. It was a fact that bombings had
                            practically stopped, that American properties had been evacuated, and
                            that some claims had been settled, and he thought that it might be
                            advisable for the Foreign Office to give out some facts. I said to Mr.
                            Yoshizawa that, in my opinion, the giving out of publicity at this time
                            would be a mistake, as it would be difficult for the Japanese to make
                            any correct statement which could have any beneficial result. I referred
                            to the large number of replies that we had recently received from the
                            Foreign Office on bombing cases, and I pointed out that mere mention of
                            the fact that replies had been recently made in 59 cases of bombing
                            would probably give the public the impression that progress was being
                            made, whereas in point of fact the replies contained in every instance
                            disclaimer of Japanese responsibility. Every statement given out by the
                            Foreign Office would, I felt certain, require further counter publicity
                            to put it in accurate perspective. Mr. Yoshizawa said that there was no
                            pretense that the replies which I mentioned were conclusive and final.
                            The Foreign Office had failed thus far to take cognizance of our various
                            notes, and the replies which had been sent were intended to discharge
                            the obligation of the Foreign Office to indicate that it was seized of
                            these matters. So far as the question of publicity was concerned, the
                            last thing he wished to do was to start a controversy in the press of
                            both countries.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation I said that I would report to the
                            Ambassador the general line of procedure proposed. Mr. Yoshizawa
                            suggested that we meet again early next week.</p>

                            Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs on December 4 (see telegram 656,

                            Director of the American Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Office on
                            December 6 (see telegram 666, December 7, 2 p.m.<note n="28"

                        <p>(1) The two telegrams cited were read with interest in the Department,
                            which approves the Ambassador’s attitude during his conversation and
                            concurs in his points made at that time.</p>
                        <p>(2) With reference to the Ambassador’s request for the Department’s
                            comment and instructions, it is suggested that the attitude and position
                            of the United States Government continue to be accurately represented by
                            the viewpoint and desiderata which were set forth in the Department’s
                            telegraphic instructions prior to the Ambassador’s conference with

                            expresses confidence in the Ambassador keeping in mind this attitude and
                            position</p>
                        <p>(3) Respecting the procedure outlined by Director Yoshizawa, the
                            Department states that naturally it has no objection to classifying
                            problems in such manner as may seem helpful to the Japanese Foreign
                            Office in considering the situation, but the Ambassador is asked to
                            avoid an expression of approval of or agreement to any special
                            classification. The various problems involved are conceived by the
                            Department to be integral parts of a single larger problem, which is
                            unwarranted interference with American rights and interests in and
                            concerning China. With reference especially to Yoshizawa’s proposed
                            categories, it is the opinion of the Department that without involving
                            in a fundamental fashion “basic principles” there could scarcely be
                            effected a fair adjustment of problems which have to do with Yangtze
                            River navigation, Shanghai’s International Settlement, Chinese maritime
                            customs, Chinese currency, etc.</p>
                        <p>(4) Reactions of the Department to statements made by the Japanese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs are indicated in the comments given below,
                            while the Department’s reaction to his statements regarding American
                            claims has been telegraphed separately.<note n="30" xml:id="d22fn30">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Regarding the Minister’s reference to a decrease in instances of American
                            properties in China being bombed by Japanese military airplanes and of
                            instances of American citizens being insulted and affronted, the
                            Department observes that, although a complete cessation of these
                            occurrences naturally is essential to improving Japanese-American
                            relations, the stopping of direct physical attacks on American citizens
                            and property would be purely a negative development.</p>
                        <p>Regarding commerce, it was pointed out with some evidence of satisfaction
                            by the Foreign Minister that certain shipments of lace and drawn work
                            from Swatow and of wood oil from Hankow indicated a Japanese wish to
                            facilitate American enterprise in China. If viewed <pb n="48"
                                xml:id="pg_48" facs="0114"/>in a perspective that includes the
                            normal free movement of Chinese-American trade, to call attention
                            especially to the isolated instances just mentioned of cargo shipments
                            (which were subject to various restrictive conditions) is to emphasize
                            the enormous damage inflicted and continuing to be inflicted by Japanese
                            military operations in China upon general American interests in and
                            concerning China.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the Minister’s indication that military operations have
                            resulted in limitations being placed upon American commercial activities
                            in China, that such limitations are temporary and exceptional, and that
                            upon the coming of peace these American rights will be restored, does he
                            suggest that official companies under Japanese Government control
                            (namely, the North China Development Company and the Central China
                            Promotion Company) and the growing and extensive monopolistic control by
                            these companies of various phases of Chinese economic life are only
                            incidental to Japanese military operations and upon cessation of such
                            operations will vanish, together with their subsidiaries in China? The
                            Japanese authorities, or regimes which function with their support and
                            under their guidance, are attempting the establishment in China of
                            currencies which are linked with the Japanese yen in such manner and
                            with such trade controls discriminatory in character that, though there
                            is comparative freedom of movement for commodities and funds between
                            Japan and its occupied areas in China, there is a serious disruption of
                            the normal flow of Chinese-American trade. Is it suggested by the
                            Foreign Minister that these developments also are temporary in
                            nature?</p>
                        <p>While the United States Government appreciates fully the efforts being
                            made by the Japanese Government to ameliorate the material damage being
                            done in China to American interests, it is constrained to observe that
                            these efforts thus far are felt to have little more than touched the
                            fringe of the problem.</p>

                                <p>1. On two previous occasions I have had the opportunity of
                                    consulting with Your Excellency on the problem of opening the
                                    way for improvement in the existing condition of relations
                                    between Japan and the United States. Today is our third meeting.
                                    On the occasion of our first interview, November 4, Your
                                    Excellency expressed the hope that in order to open the way for
                                    the improvement of existing conditions in the relations between
                                    Japan and the United States, Japan would on its part take such
                                    measures as would directly indicate to the American people that
                                    Japan desires improved diplomatic relations. These measures were
                                    to be not only of a negative but also of a positive nature. The
                                    summarized table which you presented at our meeting on November
                                        4<note n="33" xml:id="d23fn33">Table not printed.</note> has
                                    been carefully analyzed, the true conditions of the pending
                                    problems and questions have been made clear and a policy for
                                    their solution has been set forth. It is desired in the first
                                    place to present an outline of the progress, based on this
                                    policy, which has been made toward a solution.</p>
                                <p>I should like to call to Your Excellency’s attention the
                                    following facts with regard to the so-called negative measures
                                    of which you have spoken: <list>
                                        <label>(1)</label>
                                        <item>Bombings. An examination of the number of recent cases
                                            reveals one during September, two during October and
                                            none during November.</item>
                                        <label>(2)</label>
                                        <item>Indignities. No cases have been heard of

                                        <item>Questions concerning commercial rights and interests.
                                            While two or three cases have recently been reported by
                                            your Embassy, it is our policy to take appropriate and
                                            just measures for each case as soon as circumstances
                                            have been carefully examined.</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <p>Further, as it has been frequently stated, Japan is not in a
                                    position requiring it to assume responsibility for so-called
                                    compensation in such cases as are given under (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >a</hi>) on table B which was presented to Your Excellency
                                    last December 4. Nevertheless I am in a position again to
                                    declare that it is our policy to reimburse, as a solatium and
                                    token of sympathy, nationals of third countries promptly and in
                                    just and appropriate relation to the actual losses. If there is
                                    not complete agreement with regard to this point there is the
                                    possibility of further consideration. Among the items listed
                                    under (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), I can inform you that it is
                                    expected in the not distant future a settlement will be reached
                                    on the Western Roads Areas question which you seemed to view
                                    with particular seriousness in connection with the problems of
                                    the International Settlement at Shanghai. There are also
                                    prospects of readjustment at the same time of the question of
                                    the opening of the area north of Soochow Creek. I am sure that
                                    Your Excellency has also been informed by local Government [<hi
                                        rend="italic">sic</hi>] reports that the question of the
                                    purchase of leaf tobacco in Shantung by the Universal Leaf
                                    Tobacco Company has been provisionally settled.</p>
                                <p>With respect to customs, currency, Salt Administration and other
                                    general problems relating to China, while exhaustive study must
                                    be <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0116"/>given these matters in
                                    view of changing situations and future effects, in so far as the
                                    adjustment of these points with the interested countries is
                                    concerned, full consideration is being given to their interests,
                                    and a practical, fair settlement should be reached. Study is now
                                    being undertaken to this end.</p>
                                <p>2. The second point I should like to mention is the problem of
                                    navigation of the Yangtze River which has long been under
                                    consideration by the Japanese military. It is the intention of
                                    the military to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River as
                                    far as Nanking. While military operations continue in that area,
                                    and opening of the river will cause various difficulties and
                                    inconveniences, it is possible gradually to moderate military
                                    requirements. Moreover, with the inauguration of the period for
                                    gradual building up of China, it is the intention of the
                                    military to open up a portion of China despite the military
                                    inconveniences which will have to be endured. However in dealing
                                    with the opening of the military [<hi rend="italic">river</hi>]
                                    to navigation, consideration must be given to the need for
                                    consolidating various military establishments in that area and
                                    to the continued carrying on of military operations even at the
                                    present time along the banks of the river as far as Nanking, not
                                    to mention the upper reaches of the river; it therefore follows
                                    that there will be restrictions based upon military necessity.
                                    However, these restrictions should gradually be relaxed with the
                                    passage of time.</p>
                                <p>While it is desired to effect the opening of the river as early
                                    as possible in order to prevent any disturbances to the economic
                                    life of the area and to forestall any adverse effects upon the
                                    building up of the area, it is a matter [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >sic</hi>] anticipated, in the light of the preparation
                                    mentioned above and the necessity of consultation with various
                                    powers, that about two months will be required. The matter of
                                    the Pearl River is also being considered along the above
                                    lines.</p>
                                <p>3. On the occasion of my conversation with Your Excellency on
                                    November 4, I stated that in order to improve international
                                    relations a precise understanding on the part of one side of the
                                    views and Position of the other was essential and Your
                                    Excellency concurred, In so far as we are concerned, we are
                                    doing all that we can along the lines above indicated to improve
                                    Japanese-American relations and we intend to continue this
                                    policy. In our previous conversation Your Excellency spoke of
                                    the utterances by certain types of persons in American official
                                    life and of the difficulty of suppressing these utterances or
                                    newspaper comment. As you are aware there occur in Japan as well
                                    statements criticizing or opposing the actions of the
                                    Government, and when the public is moved by these statements,
                                    the Government is unable to restrain it.</p>
                                <p>With special reference to the question of reopening the Yangtze
                                    River, the view is held in certain quarters that the Japanese
                                    forces having made enormous sacrifices to reopen the river after
                                    it had been closed by the Chinese, no obligation rests on the
                                    Japanese to throw the river open to all. Consequently, as above
                                    stated, if at a time when progress is being made toward the
                                    adjusting of pending questions and concrete preparations are
                                    being made for the throwing open of the Yangtze River, no
                                    effective results are seen from the standpoint of improving
                                    international relations, the Government would be attacked by
                                    public opinion. In such contingency, adverse criticisms and <pb
                                        n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0117"/>attacks would certainly
                                    arise not only in connection with the reopening of the river but
                                    with the settlement of other pending questions, and difficulties
                                    would develop in putting such plans of settlement into effect.
                                    The result would be that relations between Japan and the United
                                    States, instead of improving would, it is feared, [tend toward
                                    the opposite direction and so proceed to a point which it would
                                    be difficult to estimate. I earnestly hope that Your Excellency
                                    will appreciate these considerations.]<note n="34"

                                <p>During our conversation on November 4, Your Excellency referred
                                    to measures both negative and positive and I recall Your
                                    Excellency’s observation that “In my view it is possible to
                                    bring about a speedy reversal of public opinion in the United
                                        States<note n="35" xml:id="d23fn35">See par. 2 of telegram
                                        No. 688, December 18, 1939, 11 p.m., from the Ambassador in
                                        Japan, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> and there is
                                    possibility of improvement in our relations if these measures
                                    can be taken immediately.” It is my expectation that the
                                    American Government will especially appreciate the fact that the
                                    Imperial Government is overcoming innumerable difficulties and
                                    as above stated is exerting its utmost efforts with a view to
                                    opening the way for improvement in American-Japanese relations,
                                    and that the American Government will in the same spirit
                                    reciprocate the efforts being put forward on our side. It goes
                                    without saying that more than anything else the termination of
                                    the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation casts the darkest shadow
                                    over American-Japanese relations. There remains but a little
                                    more than one month before the treaty expires. On the occasion
                                    of our previous conversation I said I personally hope that if it
                                    is to be that the treaty must expire, commerce between the two
                                    countries may continue in a normal manner so that there may
                                    occur nothing which will cause the peoples of the two countries
                                    to be penalized. To meet this situation some means must be
                                    devised; formalities of various kinds must first be taken, but
                                    we cannot afford to postpone due [<hi rend="italic">giving
                                        thought</hi>] to the time required for these formalities and
                                    nearly [<hi rend="italic">other</hi>] related matters. I
                                    therefore believe that there is need for arranging to enter into
                                    negotiations before the Christmas holidays begin and request
                                    Your Excellency’s consideration of this point.”</p>

                                <item>When the Foreign Minister divided Japanese-American problems
                                    into two categories, “negative” and “positive,” I pointed out
                                    the existence of certain differences of opinion between Japan
                                    and the United States involving questions of fundamental
                                    principles, which might not fall within either category
                                    mentioned, as he apparently supposed. I said that these basic
                                    considerations had been presented clearly in documents which
                                    were left with him at the meeting on November 4.</item>

                                <item>I do not recollect having spoken on November 4 to the Foreign
                                    Minister of a possible bringing about of “a speedy” reversal of

                                    and expression by me of my personal appreciation of the Japanese
                                    Government’s efforts to improve Japanese-American relations, I
                                    conveyed orally, informally, and fully to the Foreign Minister
                                    as under my Government’s instruction the reactions of the
                                    Department to the statements made to me on November 4 by the
                                    Minister (see Department’s 392, December 8, 8 p.m., paragraph 4)
                                    and with regard to American claims (see Department’s 390,
                                    December 8, 6 p.m.<note n="38" xml:id="d24fn38">Not
                                        printed.</note>). Included was the observation by the
                                    Department that it feels the efforts of the Japanese authorities
                                    have thus far little more than “touched the fringe of the
                                    problem.”</item>

                                <item>Concerning monopolies in China, the Foreign Minister said it
                                    had become necessary to organize “economic blocs” of Japan,
                                    China, and “Manchukuo” in order to overcome difficulties in
                                    national defense questions. However, exclusion of other
                                    countries is not intended, while Japan is “quite ready to
                                    welcome foreign capital.” To this, I inquired: “On a
                                    non-discriminatory basis?” and the Foreign Minister replied
                                    merely that foreign participation in these groupings would be
                                    welcome.</item>

                                <item>Regarding currency questions, he commented that the Japanese
                                    Army had to be financed but that discriminations would be
                                    modified when fighting had stopped and a Chinese Government had
                                    been established. He said all of these “inconveniences” would be
                                    modified gradually.</item>

                                <item>In concluding the conversation, the Foreign Minister spoke
                                    “off the record” to the effect that Japan and the United States
                                    must in their own interest prevent the European war’s spread to
                                    the Far East and that conciliation between Japan and the United
                                    States will powerfully assist to avoid such a
                                    contingency.</item>

                        <p>13. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of January 8 contains a
                            United Press story under Tokyo date line January 8 to the effect that it
                            is understood that the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs is prepared
                            to resume his discussions with you and to make in the course of such
                            discussions a statement to you in regard to the Japanese Government’s
                            decision to sponsor the setting up of a new regime in China under Wang
                            Ching-wei. Should the Foreign Minister in the course of conversation
                            make such a statement to you, it is suggested that it would be advisable
                            for you to express the view that the proposed regime, if set up, would
                            seem to be an artificial creation and that, judged by the experience of
                            regimes established during recent years under Japanese auspices in
                            various parts of China, we cannot escape the conclusion that the
                            proposed new regime would seem to be designed primarily to serve the
                            special purposes of Japan and would operate toward depriving the people
                            and the Government of the United States, and the people and governments
                            of other third countries, of enjoyment—or even opportunity to
                            enjoy—various long established rights in China which are legally and
                            justly theirs. (See Department’s telegram 349, November 13, 8 p.m.,

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at his own request. He began to approach
                            matters of difference between our two Governments but I interrupted him
                            to say that we were deferring all these matters to Ambassador Grew and
                            the Japanese Foreign Minister at Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he had not come to discuss the various
                            questions pending, but that he did wish to make inquiry regarding the
                            violation of a contract between Japanese agencies and American citizens
                            in connection with certain kinds of the most desirable gasoline. I
                            replied that I was a little surprised that his Government, with a long
                            list of violations of treaties, agreements and American <pb n="54"
                                xml:id="pg_54" facs="0120"/>interests all over China, would so much
                            as take notice of a single minor matter such as the question he had in
                            mind. I then said, suppose this small single matter be filed away in a
                            pigeon-hole as has been done in so many cases of injury to American
                            rights and interests in China, so that it could at some time in the
                            future be taken up and discussed to a more or less extent. I remarked
                            that so many countries were engaged in fighting in various parts of the
                            world, either for conquest or for some other unknown and unthinkable
                            purpose, that my Government felt that it should undertake to conserve
                            quite a number of commodities and products in order to be able better to
                            defend itself in case it should be attacked and that the gasoline
                            proposition was a part of this conservation.</p>
                        <p>I elaborated generally by saying to the Ambassador that, of course, he
                            knew how earnestly I and others have pled with his Government since 1933
                            to pursue a peaceful law-abiding course of cooperation, economically and
                            financially, with this nation; that it should be five times more
                            desirable and more beneficial to Japan both from the long and short
                            view, but the Army people in particular seemed to brush aside this sort
                            of sound peaceful advice and pleading with the result that they moved
                            into China with their military forces back in July 1937. I stated that
                            my Government was under no illusion as to what was going on over there
                            and what was the real purpose so far as violations, not only of treaties
                            but especially the principle of equality of industrial and commercial
                            rights and opportunities, were concerned; that in due time everyone
                            would be elbowed out, as in the case of Manchuria, so that a preference
                            for Japanese could be established throughout continental Asia. The
                            Ambassador said that exports to Manchuria had increased, to which I
                            replied that 85 to 90 percent were temporary exports in the way of
                            military supplies and implements.</p>
                        <p>I then brought up the proposed new puppet government and said it was
                            currently believed that this was being organized by Japanese military
                            forces with the result that it would be conducted as in Manchuria
                            altogether for and in the interests of Japan and at the expense of other
                            nations. The Ambassador rather mildly denied this view but not even to
                            his own satisfaction, as it seemed to me. He sought also to indicate
                            that his Government did not expect to deny other nations their rights
                            under the open door policy, or especially the principle of equality of
                            commercial and industrial rights. I brushed aside this theory in view of
                            the concrete facts, adding that the Japanese Government could in short
                            order, if and when it might so desire, make clear to the world its
                            position to this effect, but, of course, there was no real disposition
                            so far for it to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador again referred to the alleged breach of the gasoline
                            contract. I said that an additional reply or comment on the matter <pb
                                n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0121"/>might well be that, in the
                            language of the Japanese Government relating to the Nine Power Treaty,
                            the gasoline understanding has become “obsolete”. The Ambassador
                            appeared a little amused but not much.</p>

                        <p>147. Replying to an interpellation in a committee meeting of the Lower
                            House yesterday afternoon, the Foreign Minister made a statement with
                            regard to Japanese-American relations of which the following is reported
                            to be the substance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Even though the United States does not understand the object of
                                    Japan’s Holy War with China, opposes the establishment of a new
                                    order in East Asia on all fronts, and even though the United
                                    States should insist upon carrying through its demands, the
                                    Japanese Government is not afraid of the future. The situation
                                    has not reached that stage, however. With respect to the problem
                                    of opening the Yangtze to navigation, the Japanese Government,
                                    as I have repeatedly stated, does not entertain for a moment the
                                    idea that a new commercial treaty can be had in return for the
                                    opening of the Yangtze River. The question of the opening of the
                                    Yangtze and other problems pending between the United States and
                                    Japan which are capable of settlement will be dealt with
                                    appropriately, that is to say, they will be handled in
                                    accordance with Japan’s ‘independent’ policy which is, after
                                    all, what we mean by ‘Imperial way’ diplomacy. To leave
                                    unsettled those problems which are capable of being settled and
                                    to employ them to obtain advantages in dealing with other
                                    problems is a policy contrary to the spirit of the Imperial way.
                                    We do not know precisely what the American Government has under
                                    consideration, but if it is determined to ignore completely the
                                    object of Japan’s Holy War and to refuse to lift a finger, Japan
                                    should display an attitude of resolution. The purpose of Japan’s
                                    Holy War is clear: it is the establishment of a new order in
                                    East Asia. From whatever angle this may be viewed it is open and
                                    aboveboard. With respect to the American attitude there is some
                                    misunderstanding among the Japanese people. The United States
                                    contends that Japan has ignored the Nine Power Treaty, etc., but
                                    the Japanese Government does not admit this contention. Neither
                                    the Japanese Government nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                    have recognized this contention from the outset. If an attempt
                                    should be made to get Japan to recognize this contention by
                                    force of arms, a real problem would arise. As it is plain that
                                    Japan would not yield to the United States under such
                                    circumstances, I think it is a little early to argue that the
                                    Foreign Minister is yielding to the United States.”</p>

                                <p>“To free the world from contentions and conflicts and to make
                                    peace and good will prevail among mankind is an aim consonant

                                    Needless to say, this new relationship should of necessity

                                    Our goal is plain as day. The concrete program for the
                                    construction of the new order which the Japanese Government
                                    proposes to accomplish in concert with the new Central
                                    Government of China is formulated on that very statement. It is
                                    devoted to no other purpose than that the nations concerned
                                    shall respect one another’s racial and national endowments and
                                    shall cultivate friendly relations of natural aid and good
                                    fellowship, stand guard against the menace of communism so as to
                                    insure the peace of East Asia, and practice the principle of
                                    ministering to one another’s needs by setting up a reciprocal
                                    economic system. That Japan will respect China’s independence
                                    and freedom has been made clear in the successive statements
                                    issued by our Government, and it will be proved in fact as the
                                    present disturbances subside.</p>
                                <p>Although Japan and China are now engaged in hostilities, the two
                                    peoples retain in their hearts the spoils [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >sic</hi>] of mutual sympathy and tolerance. The longer the
                                    hostilities last, the greater will be the sacrifice imposed upon
                                    East Asia. But certainly the great timeless mission of our
                                    Empire cannot be abandoned simply because of the sacrifices of
                                    this conflict. The determination of our Government and people is
                                    firm as ever, and the strength of our nation has been
                                    replenished according to plan, so that we are all ready to carry
                                    on our campaign, no matter how long, until the eyes of China’s
                                    anti-Japanese and pro-Communist regime are finally opened.</p>
                                <p>Farsighted men are not lacking among the 400 million people of
                                    China. Some enlightened leaders have long advocated peace and
                                    national salvation. In order to rescue their nation from
                                    suffering <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0123"/>and distress,
                                    they are fearlessly standing for right and dedicating their
                                    lives to their cause. These men who share in the same
                                    solicitudes toward the general welfare of East Asia are our
                                    comrades. We cannot but admire them for their high purpose and
                                    their unselfish enterprise.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Wang Ching-wei is an outstanding figure of this group. He
                                    could not endure to see the actual state of affairs by which his
                                    people are needlessly plunged into the depth of misery owing to
                                    the mistaken policy of the Chungking regime, which in the last
                                    analysis only hastened the Sovietization of his country. He came
                                    out for national salvation through opposition to communism and
                                    conclusion of peace with Japan. In the face of all manners of
                                    pressure and persecution by Chungking, he pursued the path of
                                    his conviction, bringing light to his people lost in darkness.
                                    Thus has he won the confidence and the following of his nation.
                                    His peace and national salvation movement as well as the
                                    preparation for a new central government have made rapid headway
                                    since the Sixth Kuomintang National Congress which was held in
                                    Shanghai in August of last year.</p>
                                <p>For the sake of the peace of East Asia, we are truly gratified to
                                    know that the Central Political Council is to meet soon and a
                                    new central government will be brought to being with the united
                                    support and cooperation of both regimes at Peiping and Nanking
                                    and also of many leaders representing the various political
                                    groups and various sections of society. Japan will, of course,
                                    render wholehearted assistance toward the formation of the new
                                    government and is prepared speedily to extend recognition
                                    following its establishment.</p>
                                <p>In this connection I should add that I am deeply impressed by the
                                    fact that in full accord with Mr. Wang those leading statesmen
                                    in the Peiping and Nanking Government who have for the past two
                                    and a half years devoted every ounce of their energy to the
                                    reconstruction and rehabilitation of their respective areas, are
                                    now going forward with the work of restoring peace and building
                                    up a new China.</p>
                                <p>On the eve of the establishment of a new central government of
                                    China, I express my ardent hope that Mr. Wang and all those
                                    other men of vision and leadership, united in purpose and
                                    resolute in action, will proceed with the great task for the
                                    regeneration of Asia. I am convinced that their earnest
                                    endeavors will meet with approval and support, both in and out
                                    of China, and that the misfortune brought on by the present
                                    Sino-Japanese conflict will be turned into an eternal
                                    blessing.”</p>

                        <p>199. The press reports that the Foreign Minister made the following reply
                            to an interpellation in regard to Japanese-American relations in the
                            Budget Committee of the Lower House this morning: <pb n="58"

                                <p>“With respect to Japanese-American relations, we have been
                                    concerned that they have not been satisfactory of late. However,
                                    we by no means think that improvement is impossible. We are
                                    making and are determined to continue to make every effort
                                    toward improvement. The fundamental cause of Japanese-American
                                    relations reaching their present state, the focal point of which
                                    is the China incident, lies in the failure of the American
                                    Government and people fully to understand Japanese thought and
                                    action relating to the incident. The Government has exerted
                                    every effort in this connection but has not succeeded in having
                                    the United States recognize our real intentions or the new world
                                    situation. Each country has its own viewpoint and interests, and
                                    in some instances these cannot be understood no matter how they
                                    are explained. Present day Japanese-American relations are in a
                                    stage, I think, where the United States because of its relations
                                    with China or because of traditional habits of thought is not
                                    yet able to understand the Imperial Government’s thought and
                                    actions. Nevertheless, the Imperial Government will exert every
                                    effort towards such understanding. It is of greater importance
                                    that not only should the Government and its representatives make
                                    every endeavor to explain in order that American public opinion
                                    may receive a correct understanding of the situation but that
                                    the Japanese people from all classes and quarters should discuss
                                    the problem from every angle in order that they too may convey
                                    correct understanding. In short, the Government does not think
                                    that Japanese-American relations are stalemated and that nothing
                                    can be done. We intend to make every possible effort to change
                                    the conception prevailing in public and private circles in the
                                    United States.”</p>

                        <p>200. 1. Replying to an interpellation in the Budget Committee of the
                            Lower House yesterday afternoon with regard to the attitude of the
                            United States towards Japan, the Prime Minister is reported to have
                            stated <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> as follows (our translation of
                            press stenographic record): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As for the problem of a general embargo this is a serious matter
                                    for the country imposing the embargo, [as well as?] the country
                                    upon which it is imposed. If one false step is taken, danger
                                    lies ahead for both countries. I do not believe that the United
                                    States would risk applying a general embargo upon Japan.
                                    However, we must be prepared for any eventuality. The Government
                                    is giving every consideration to this point. However, the
                                    question of the danger to the two countries through the
                                    imposition of an embargo is more than important—it is pure
                                    supposition—and I must refrain from giving ‘yes’ or ‘no’ replies
                                    to questions based on supposition.”</p>

                                    category. The United States is supplying certain types materials
                                    to the Chiang regime none of which are supplied to Japan. In
                                    other words, indirect aid to the Chiang regime has the effect of
                                    a moral embargo. The United States would deny this, but that is
                                    the way it appears to Japan.</p>
                                <p>The United States does not fully grasp the real significance of
                                    the so-called new order in East Asia. As I have often stated,
                                    the United States harbors the misunderstanding that foreign
                                    rights and interests and American rights and interests and
                                    economic activity in China and in East Asia are to be ousted. As
                                    you are also aware the United States persistently advocates the
                                    application of the principle of the open door and equality of
                                    opportunity. I do not deny that the American attitude toward
                                    Japan has become stronger with the progress of the China
                                    incident and that Japanese-American relations have become
                                    progressively worse. As I have frequently declared we are making
                                    every effort to explain Japan’s ideas with regard to the new
                                    order, the open door, equality of opportunity, etc. However, we
                                    have been unable up to the present time to convince the United
                                    States. The state of affairs is such that so long as hostilities
                                    endure in China misconceptions will be announced of the right of
                                    Americans and it will be impossible for Japan’s real intentions
                                    to be understood. I trust, however, that with the progress of
                                    the incident, the diminution of hostilities, and the advent of
                                    peace it will be possible to predict [that] the United States
                                    [will] recognize the new situation. These considerations
                                    preclude the thought that relations between Japan and the United
                                    States are bound to become aggravated. We must exert every
                                    effort to perfect our policy and obtain recognition for it.
                                    Accordingly I believe that the Japanese Government should seize
                                    every opportunity to make the Japanese attitude fully understood
                                    by the American Government.”</p>

                            the setting up of a new regime at Nanking has the appearance of a
                            further step in a program of one country by armed force to impose its
                            will upon a neighboring country and to block off a large area of the

                            the world. The developments there appear to be following the pattern of
                            other regimes and systems which have been set up in China under the
                            aegis of an outside power and which in their functioning especially
                            favor the interests of that outside power and deny to nationals of the
                            United States and other third countries enjoyment of long-established
                            rights of equal and fair treatment which are legally and justly
                            theirs.</p>
                        <p>“The Government of the United States has noted statements of high
                            officials of that outside power that their country intends to respect
                            the political independence and the freedom of the other country and that
                            with the development of affairs in East Asia this intention will be
                            demonstrated. To this Government the circumstances, both military and
                            diplomatic, which have attended the setting up of the new regime at
                            Nanking do not seem consistent with such an intention.</p>
                        <p>“The attitude of the United States toward use of armed force as an
                            instrument of national policy is well known. Its attitude and position
                            with regard to various aspects of the situation in the Far East have
                            been made clear on numerous occasions. That attitude and position remain
                            unchanged.</p>
                        <p>“This Government again makes full reservation of this country’s rights
                            under international law and existing treaties and agreements.</p>
                        <p>“Twelve years ago the Government of the United States recognized, as did
                            other governments, the National Government of the Republic of China. The
                            Government of the United States has ample reason for believing that that
                            Government, with capital now at Chungking, has had and still has the
                            allegiance and support of the great majority of the Chinese people. The
                            Government of the United States of course continues to recognize that
                            Government as the Government of China.”</p>

                                <p>“Statement of the Imperial Japanese Government upon the occasion
                                    of the establishment of the new Central Government:</p>
                                <p>March 30, 1940. Life is a constant progression, and conditions
                                    change from time to time. The relations between nations are
                                    regulated in accordance with these changes. It is in conformity
                                    with such actualities that Japan is exerting her utmost efforts
                                    for the [omission] manifestation of international justice and
                                    the firm establishment of peace among mankind.</p>
                                <p>Now that a new Central Government of China has been established,
                                    and the construction of a renascent China begun, the full [<hi
                                        rend="italic">sic</hi>] Japanese Government wish to offer
                                    their congratulations, they must extend to this new government
                                    their wholehearted cooperation and support for its development,
                                    in accordance with their repeated declarations.</p>
                                <p>It is Japan’s earnest expectation that the various powers will
                                    come to a clear understanding of this solemn reality, and will
                                    forthwith contribute toward the establishment of peace in East
                                    Asia.</p>
                                <p>What Japan asks of China is that she make complete her
                                    independence and freedom on a moral basis, and that she proceed,
                                    in cooperation with Japan, towards the construction of a new
                                    order in Asia, thereby mutually participating in the resulting
                                    peace and prosperity.</p>
                                <p>In order that Japan, and the other countries of East Asia, may
                                    preserve their existence, it is only natural that she should
                                    show special concern and desire for the development and
                                    utilization of the resources of China. Japan has no intention,
                                    however, of excluding such peaceful economic activities of third
                                    powers as conform with the new situation in East Asia. On the
                                    contrary it is her desire to cooperate with these powers and
                                    thereafter share with them the benefits of international
                                    amnesties [<hi rend="italic">amenities?</hi>]. It is for this
                                    reason that Japan, despite the abnormal conditions arising out
                                    of continued military operations, has sustained numerous
                                    inconveniences in order to protect the rights and interests of
                                    third powers. The Imperial Japanese Government are confident
                                    that the new China will pursue a similar policy.</p>
                                <p>A renascent China has just set out on the road to progress; a new
                                    defence is about to commence in East Asia. So long, however, as
                                    the remaining pro-Communist and anti-Japanese forces fail to
                                    awaken from their illusory dreams, Japan will not lay down her
                                    arms: nor will she relax her vigilance and her firm
                                    determination to surmount any obstacles that may arise in the
                                    future.”</p>

                        <p>222. According to the press, the Foreign Office spokesman at his press
                            conference today with the foreign correspondents made <hi rend="italic"
                                >inter alia</hi> the following remarks in regard to the Secretary’s
                            statement of March 30 concerning the Nanking regime (there is of course
                            no actual written record of the remarks made at these conferences): <pb

                                <p>“The statement is natural, considering the attitude of the United
                                    States toward the China affair. It is very important, however,
                                    in two respects. The first is that from the conversations held
                                    last year between Ambassador Grew and the then Foreign Minister
                                    Admiral Nomura the United States Government gave us to
                                    understand that it was ready to enter into talks in a
                                    constructive spirit. But Mr. Hull in his statement makes it
                                    clear that the United States Government will not recognize the
                                    new government and on the other hand that it will continue to
                                    recognize as the National Government of China the Chungking
                                    Government with which Japan is engaged in hostilities. Such an
                                    attitude will instigate anti-Japanese groups such as the
                                    Committee for Nonparticipation in Japanese Aggression, headed by
                                    Henry L. Stimson,<note n="44" xml:id="d33fn44">Secretary of
                                        State during the Hoover administration.</note> to greater
                                    activities, and will also be a factor in immensely encouraging
                                    the Chungking Government. The second point is that of the
                                    efforts we have been making and the assurances we have given to
                                    ameliorate Japanese-American relations. Mr. Hull’s statement,
                                    without waiting a reasonable length of time for those assurances
                                    to materialize, disregards them. The Hull statement charges
                                    Japan with setting up an economic bloc against the rest of the
                                    world. This is not a fact. Economic obstacles experienced by
                                    foreign powers are only a temporary phenomenon during the
                                    transitory period from hostilities to peace. We cannot nor can
                                    any other country be blind to the facts as they are. Our troops
                                    are occupying a smaller area of China and Chinese are fewer in
                                    number in that area than in the areas paying allegiance to
                                    Chungking. But substantially speaking, more than 90% of the
                                    total customs revenue of China is being collected in the areas
                                    under the new government. And more than half of the
                                    administrative organs of the country are under the new
                                    government. Mr. Hull’s statement ignores new developments taking
                                    place in China and is inconsistent with the statement in the
                                    American Government’s note of December 30, 1938,<note n="45"

                                    the Japanese Government that ‘it is well aware of the changes
                                    that are taking place in the Far East.’ [Apparent omission] the
                                    Japanese Government regards the attitude of foreign countries
                                    toward the new China regime with grave concern from the
                                    standpoint of peace and stability in the Far East. Japan can not
                                    cooperate with the powers who disregard this. We are doing our
                                    best to improve Japanese-American relations. Most of the issues
                                    have arisen out of the China affair. If that is the case, the
                                    United States should be a little more patient. If the United
                                    States desires peace and order in China, it should wait a little
                                    while longer and help us to establish peace and order
                                    there.”</p>

                            in matters of principle a continuance of the conversations looking
                            toward the negotiation of a new commercial treaty at this juncture would
                            be futile. (The Foreign Minister had said the same thing to the British
                            Ambassador a few days ago, but had used the expression “owing to the
                            rigidity of the American position”.)</p>
                        <p>I agreed with Mr. Arita that important discrepancies in questions of
                            principle existed in the views of our two Governments, but I added that
                            more acute phases of the difficulties between the United States and
                            Japan centered in the continued and recently aggravated interference on
                            the part of the Japanese armed forces with American rights and interests
                            in China which I felt should be obviated before the problems involving
                            questions of principle could successfully be solved. At this point I
                            showed to the Minister and read the headings of a statement of more than
                            twenty typewritten pages covering the instances of current interference
                            with American business, trade, and commerce through monopolistic
                            measures and exchange control, and import and export control
                            restrictions in China. (As this was an informal conversation I did not
                            hand this document to the Minister but shall consider the advisability
                            of sending it to him subsequently in support of my oral statement.) I
                            said that I had become greatly discouraged by this recrudescence of
                            bombings and other acute cases of interference with American rights and
                            by the absence of visible effort to implement the assurances continually
                            given us with regard to the intention of the Japanese Government to
                            ensure in practice the principle of equal opportunity and respect for
                            American commercial arid other interests in China. The Minister replied
                            that Mr. Tani had informed him of my recent representations concerning
                            the bombings and the difficulties at the barriers in Tientsin,<note

                            conditions. He hoped that the barriers in Tientsin would soon be raised.
                            At least some of our complaints regarding monopolistic measures and
                            exchange control and import and export restrictions would be solved when
                            the hostilities in China were terminated. The Minister referred to his
                            efforts to settle claims for damages in China which, even though the
                            results might not be entirely satisfactory to the claimants,
                            nevertheless represented <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0130"/>an
                            effort made in good faith to meet these claims.<note n="47"

                            these efforts but added that thus far they had barely touched the fringe

                        <p>The Minister then spoke of the rumors of my return to the United States
                            on leave of absence. I replied that the question of leave of absence
                            arose annually and that my plans for this year were not yet settled but
                            that frankly, after waiting in vain for the last several months for some
                            evidence of implementation of the assurances given me with regard to an
                            improvement in the situation of American rights and interests in China
                            and seeing only a recrudescence and intensification of interference with
                            those rights and interests, I was becoming doubtful of my ability to
                            accomplish constructive work here and felt that personal contact with my
                            Government at this time might be more helpful than remaining in Tokyo. I
                            said that I had already made the position and attitude of my Government
                            perfectly clear to the Japanese Government and that we were now waiting
                            patiently but apparently futilely for results. The Minister said that he
                            hoped that I would not leave Japan at this juncture because the Japanese
                            public, which at present is very much disturbed at the worsening of
                            Japanese-American relations, would interpret my departure as a partial
                            rupture of relations and that the public reaction might be “very
                            serious”. I replied that I would consider the matter in the light of the
                            Minister’s views and would let him know of my decision shortly. If I
                            should decide to abandon my leave of absence I hoped that the decision
                            would prove to be justified through a positive improvement in the
                            situation of American interests in China.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then spoke of the forthcoming visit to Japan of the High
                            Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, who, with Mrs. Sayre, is to
                            visit us at the Embassy on April 30 for several days. He alluded to the
                            proposed immigration bill and referred to certain alleged difficulties
                            between the High Commissioner and the Japanese Consul General in Manila.
                            I said that these matters could be discussed when Mr. Sayre arrives and
                            in the meantime I read to him the immigration figures given in a
                            telegram from the Department dated April 22.<note n="48"

                            public opinion. I said that the one-sidedness of publicity in Japan was
                            well illustrated by the importance attached by the Japanese press to the
                            observations of an American officer, who had announced that he was
                            speaking for himself alone and not on behalf of the Government, <pb
                                n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0131"/>while not one word appeared in
                            the Japanese press about the bombings and other serious incidents in
                            derogation of American rights and interests continually occurring in
                            China. I referred in this connection to past public utterances of
                            Japanese officials, notably a speech by General Araki, then Minister of
                            War, quoted in the press several years ago (and not subsequently
                            withdrawn or denied in spite of my official protest) which included the
                            phrase: “The United States and Soviet Russia are like ravening wolves
                            and castaway cats, baring their teeth and claws for attack.” The
                            Minister made no comment.</p>
                        <p>There ensued a desultory discussion of the war in Europe. In spite of the
                            acrid nature of some of the comments advanced in the conversation, which
                            lasted approximately one hour, it was conducted in friendly vein and
                            tone. I ended on the note that statesmanship must look to the long
                            future rather than to the immediate present and that the reasons for
                            Japanese-American friendship are fundamental and must win out in the
                            long run simply because, in the long run, Japan cannot get along without
                            the friendship of the United States.</p>

                            French and Italian armed forces, the Ambassador is instructed to
                            approach the Japanese Government informally to the following effect:

                                    informally agreed that in case the European war should

                                    been received from the American Embassy at Peiping to the effect
                                    that the officers in command of European armed detachments at

                                    with the agreement arrived at at Shanghai. The American
                                    Government takes for granted that the European forces at
                                    Tientsin are included in this attitude. As a party to various

                        <p>191. In the press conference on June 8 the Under Secretary, in reply to
                            an inquiry as to whether there might be efforts under way to improve our
                            relations with Japan, said that, as the correspondents knew, there had
                            been continued conversations over a period of many months with regard to
                            matters in which American nationals and this Government were interested,
                            but that he had nothing particular in mind at the present moment. The
                            correspondent mentioned a recent editorial in the <hi rend="italic">New
                                York Daily News</hi> and a column by Walter Lippmann declaring that
                            this might be an opportune time for friendlier relations with Japan, and
                            press reports of June 8 from Shanghai intimating that Japan was
                            interested in the same question. The Under Secretary answered that he
                            had seen a great many articles of this kind. He said that this
                            Government was always anxious to maintain and create the most friendly
                            relations with all countries, provided of <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67"
                                facs="0133"/>course that conditions and the policies of the other
                            countries made it possible. Asked whether he was more hopeful of this
                            being possible with regard to Japan at the present time, the Under
                            Secretary said that we were always hopeful.</p>

                        <p>In compliance with the Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 180, June
                            4, 11 p.m.,<note n="49" xml:id="d38fn49">Not printed.</note> I met the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs today privately at the house of a mutual
                            friend in order to reduce the risk of publicity. My conversation in
                            general was based upon the tenor of paragraphs 7 and 8 of our telegram
                            No. 400, June 3, noon; the Department’s telegraphic instructions No.
                            172, May 30, 2 p.m.; and No. 180, June 4, 11 p.m.<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d38fn50">None printed.</note> During the course of my
                            remarks I made a particular effort to obviate the possibility of the
                            Minister’s drawing any inference that either the American Government or
                            I inclined toward any compromise or abandonment of policy or principle.
                            The approach which I made was of a broad nature and not in specific
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>I prefaced my remarks to the Foreign Minister by reading a press
                                report<note n="51" xml:id="d38fn51">See telegram No. 191, June 10,
                                to the Ambassador in Japan, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note>
                            quoting Mr. Welles as declaring on June 8, in part, that our Government
                            is desirous of attaining friendlier relations with all other countries,
                            including Japan, provided internal conditions in those countries make
                            such improvement feasible—observing at the same time that, although I
                            had received no confirmation of the accuracy of the text, I knew that
                            its general tenor reflected my Government’s attitude. Mr. Arita
                            commented that he had read the report with much pleasure.</p>
                        <p>After this introductory remark I referred to the Minister’s request at
                            our last meeting, on April 26, that the conversation at that time be
                            regarded as entirely informal, and suggested that the same
                            characterization apply to our talk today. The Minister concurred in
                            this. I said that I was acting today upon my own initiative and speaking
                            my own thoughts, and that I had asked for this meeting because it seemed
                            to me important and possibly helpful that the Minister and I should from
                            time to time explore the relations between our two countries. I said
                            that I would like to develop our talk in two main phases: on the one
                            hand, the past and the present; and on the other, the future.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Minister’s remark to the British Ambassador on May 27,
                            quoting me as saying that there could be no possibility of <pb n="68"
                                xml:id="pg_68" facs="0134"/>an improvement of American-Japanese
                            relations so long as the China conflict continued, I conveyed my
                            impression, derived from our interview which took place on April 26,
                            that the Minister himself shared that view. I said that although I did
                            not remember ever having expressed my views to the Minister in exactly
                            those terms, it must nevertheless be made clear with all the emphasis at
                            my command that our relations cannot be expected to move into
                            fundamentally happier channels so long as Japanese interference with
                            American rights and interests in China continues and so long as Japan
                            continues to endeavor to achieve various positive national objectives
                            through measures of force. I elaborated on this theme at some length. On
                            the other hand, I said that the American Government and people would
                            welcome the fulfillment of their desire for an early return to mutually
                            good and helpful relations with Japan; that the world situation now more
                            than ever dictates the importance of our building up such relations; and
                            that definite evidence of a reorientation of Japanese policy and efforts
                            foregoing the use of force as an instrument of national policy would be
                            viewed with sympathy by the United States. I declared that “I have every
                            confidence that by proceeding along the course I have suggested, it may
                            be possible in due course to open the way to a new era in
                            American-Japanese relations.”</p>
                        <p>Speaking further and “off the record,” I alluded to the address which the
                            Minister had made before the Pacific Association on June 3 (reported in
                            our telegram No. 413, June 4, 8 p.m.), and said that I had been
                            especially struck by the earnestness of Mr. Arita’s plea for the removal
                            of barriers to trade as a prerequisite to the creating, after the
                            present war in Europe, of a new world order, and that I could not
                            restrain the feeling that if the Japanese Government could associate
                            itself with the American Government in bringing about a free flow of
                            commodities between nations, substantial progress might be made toward
                            removing the causes of unrest, reflected in the conflicts both in Europe
                            and in the Far East. I spoke at length of the unsoundness of economic
                            blocs and of the creation of barriers to trade, devices which can never
                            constitute a permanent basis for a progressive world economy. I repeated
                            the remarks made to the Minister during our talk on April 26 to the
                            effect that statesmanship must look to the long future rather than to
                            the immediate present and that the reasons which dictate the maintenance
                            of friendship between our two countries are fundamental and must prevail
                            in the long run. I said that the confidence which I repose in that
                            belief is stronger now than ever before. After then discussing the
                            situation in Europe, the menace to civilization which has there arisen,
                            and the unprecedented program of rearmament in the United States for
                            defense and security after years of earnest effort to bring about world
                                <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0135"/>disarmament, I ended my
                            remarks on the following note: “The confident knowledge that Japan, a
                            nation for which the American people have entertained for more than
                            eighty years feelings of the friendliest character, is prepared to align
                            its policy and attitude with those of the United States would, in my
                            carefully studied opinion, contribute far more to the future security
                            and well-being of Japan than the achievement of objectives in the Far
                            East by means which the American people have renounced.”</p>
                        <p>I then read to the Minister, as an indication of the historic attitude of
                            the American Government and people toward Japan, the message of the
                            Secretary of State to Mr. Hirota on March 3, 1934,<note n="52"
                                xml:id="d38fn52"><ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_127">Vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 127</ref>.</note> and finally
                            handed to him the statement prepared in the Embassy,<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d38fn53">Not printed.</note> of which I made mention in
                            paragraph two of my telegram No. 289, April 27, 2 p.m.,<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d38fn55">Not printed.</note> comprising a partial list of
                            infractions of American rights in China which had been revised and, in
                            so far as possible from the information in the Embassy’s possession,
                            brought up to date.</p>
                        <p>After I had completed the presentation of my views Mr. Arita said, “I
                            agree in spirit and in principle with everything you have said.” He
                            remarked “off the record” on the difficulties experienced by the
                            Japanese Government in endeavoring to cope with various elements in this
                            country which advocate a <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> with the
                            totalitarian nations, and although he spoke in guarded language he
                            conveyed beyond a doubt that the Government (mentioning especially the
                            Prime Minister and himself) wished to see a different orientation
                            developed. Judging by remarks which he made previously and subsequently,
                            it was evident that this reference was to a desire on their part for
                            closer relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>After his opening remark above referred to, the Minister had commented
                            that the bulk of the United States fleet remains in Hawaiian waters. My
                            reply was that Hawaii is American territory and that one of our most
                            important naval ports is that of Pearl Harbor, and I went on to say that
                            the fact that our fleet remains in Hawaiian waters represents no threat
                            whatsoever to Japan. The Minister, however, replied that the continued
                            stay of our fleet in those waters constitutes an implied suspicion of
                            the intentions of Japan vis-à-vis the Netherlands East Indies and the
                            South Seas, and he desired categorically to assert that Japan entertains
                            no territorial ambitions. Quite to the contrary, he added, Japan is
                            exerting her best efforts to promote good relations with her neighbors,
                            and he cited as an example that a non-aggression pact is to be signed
                            within a few days with Thailand. The emphasis which the Minister placed
                            upon this <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0136"/>matter is an indication
                            of the important effect on Japanese consciousness of the stay of our
                            naval forces in Hawaii.</p>
                        <p>Replying to my own observations, the Minister inquired what suggestions
                            of a concrete nature the United States Government could propose looking
                            to an improvement in the relations between our two countries. I stated
                            that the whole tenor of my remarks had given plain indication as to the
                            nature of the reply which my Government would make to such an inquiry.
                            He, however, requested me to transmit his inquiry to the Department and
                            said that he hoped for an answer. (It may be that the Minister wishes
                            for some specific reason to obtain a formal statement from me “as under
                            instructions”.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arita next said that he assumed that I was informed of the subject of
                            the talks which he had had with Mr. Sayre. He said that the High
                            Commissioner had suggested the possibility of a meeting taking place
                            either in Manila or in Hong Kong between representatives of the Japanese
                            Government and of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, but that as Mr. Sayre
                            feared publicity, the matter had subsequently not been pursued. The
                            Minister stated that his Government was prepared to deal with Chiang
                            Kai-shek on the basis of the terms contained in Prince Konoye’s
                                statement.<note n="54" xml:id="d38fn54">Apparently refers to
                                statement of December 22, 1938, <ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_482"
                                    >vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 482</ref>.</note> I was
                            left in no doubt that the Minister was exploring the possibility of an
                            extension of good offices by the United States, although he made no
                            request therefor. My only comment was that it was my assumption that
                            should the Japanese Government desire to get in touch with Chiang
                            Kai-shek it should be very easy to do so without intermediation and
                            privately. In reply the Minister merely mumbled something in a low tone
                            to the effect that the Japanese military were difficult. The subject was
                            not pursued.</p>
                        <p>During the course of our conversation Mr. Arita inquired in a casual
                            manner as to the possibility of concluding a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> between our two Governments but did not broach the
                            subject in the form either of a proposal or of a request. I limited my
                            observations to the remark that most of the elements of such a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> are now operative in fact if not in
                            name, and he did not pursue the subject. Should the moment arrive when
                            the consideration of a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> would appear
                            opportune, we can properly refer to the Minister’s having raised this
                            question in the course of this informal conversation.</p>
                        <p>The conversation closed with a few remarks regarding the war in Europe
                            and the Minister’s expectation of hearing at any moment that Italy had
                            entered the war.</p>
                        <p>I must here record my impression that the Minister, who is ordinarily
                            rather reserved and reticent, was unusually friendly and that as I was
                            departing after more than an hour of conversation he shook <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0137"/>my hand with marked cordiality. I felt
                            indeed that I could sense a new and unusual attitude on his part. He
                            requested that I leave with him the notes of an informal nature on which
                            I had based my remarks since he said that he might desire to make
                            further comment on my presentation. Summing up the net results of our
                            meeting, my view is that, although our attitude toward the present
                            course of Japanese policy, which involves the continued employment of
                            force, has once more been made clear in emphatic terms, leaving no
                            possible doubt regarding our policy and our intention unequivocally to
                            abide by that policy without compromising or abandoning any of our
                            fundamental principles, a note has been struck nonetheless regarding the
                            “long haul” which probably will receive careful consideration by the
                            Japanese Government.</p>

                                our conversation at the Embassy on April 26 was that although
                                efforts were being made by the Japanese Government to put a stop to
                                the bombings by the Japanese forces of American properties in China,
                                and to settle certain claims of American citizens, there was
                                nevertheless a fundamental cleavage between the policies and views
                                of our respective countries which precludes the expectation that
                                constructive action can be taken toward improving our relations

                                between our two countries are generally regarded in Japan as

                                as saying that there could be no possibility, so long as the
                                conflict in China continued, of an improvement in the relations
                                between the United States and Japan.</item>

                                to admit that the logical implications of the observations which I
                                have made on various occasions to you and to your predecessors are
                                substantially along the lines of the statement which Sir Robert

                            <item>I do remember very clearly saying on innumerable occasions that
                                cessation of bombings of American property in China, of depredation
                                against American property, of the inflicting of indignities on
                                American citizens and of interference with American commercial
                                activities in China, must precede any positive steps looking toward
                                the restoring of friendly relations between the United States and

                                merchants in China by means of the establishment of monopolies,
                                control of foreign exchange, etc., is equivalent to asking that
                                Japan abandon those objectives in China of which monopolies,
                                exchange and trade control and so on are the instruments of
                                achievement.</item>

                            <item>I wish at this time again to emphasize that relations between our
                                two countries cannot improve so long as there is continuance of
                                interference in the various forms which I have just indicated with

                                interference with American rights and interests in China is alone
                                capable of opening the way to the improvement of relations: I must
                                make it clear with all the emphasis at my command that we cannot
                                expect the fundamentally friendly relations which Your Excellency
                                and I equally desire so long as Japan continues to endeavor to

                                could not restrain the feeling that, if the Japanese Government

                        <p>The American Government is awaiting concrete evidence of the steps, and
                            the results thereof, which the Japanese Government is taking towards
                            giving practical effect to its continual assurances that it intends to
                            respect American rights and interests in China, long established in
                            legality and justice.</p>
                        <p>The American Government has in no way modified its position with regard
                            to various aspects of American relations with Japan. The American
                            Government continues to adhere to the full import of its position as set
                            forth on numerous occasions in communications to the Japanese
                            Government, notably in my conversation with the then Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, General Ugaki, on July 4, 1938, at which time I left
                            with the Minister a full typewritten statement of my

                        <p>While there has been a diminution, but not a complete cessation, of the
                            bombing of American properties in China by Japanese military planes and
                            of instances of insults and affronts to American citizens, we feel that
                            this diminution has been a purely negative development. Complete
                            cessation of such occurrences is of course essential to improvement in
                            Japanese-American relations.</p>
                        <p>The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Admiral Nomura, was good enough
                            to indicate to me in the course of our several conversations that
                            limitations upon commercial activities of Americans in China have been
                            the result of military operations and that these limitations are
                            exceptional and temporary and that American rights will be restored when
                            peace comes. My Government queries whether this indication implies that
                            the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion
                            Company, official companies controlled by the Japanese Government, and
                            the extensive and growing monopolistic control of these companies over
                            various phases of the economic life of China, are merely incidental to
                            military operations and will, <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0142"
                            />with their subsidiaries in China, disappear when military operations
                            cease.</p>
                        <p>My Government has further inquired, after referring to the attempts of
                            the Japanese authorities over regimes functioning under their guidance
                            and with their support, to establish in China currencies linked with the
                            Japanese yen in such a way and with such trade controls of a
                            discriminatory character, that while commodities and funds move with
                            comparative freedom between Japan and Japanese occupied areas in China
                            the normal flow of commerce between Japan and the United States is
                            seriously disrupted—my Government inquires whether the Japanese
                            Government suggests that these developments are also of a temporary
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>While the American Government fully appreciates the efforts which the
                            Japanese Government is now making toward amelioration of the material
                            damage being done to American interests in China, it is constrained to
                            observe that it feels that thus far these efforts have little more than
                            touched the fringe of the problem.</p>
                        <p>From all available evidence the framework has been laid for the eventual
                            expulsion of all non-Japanese trade, industry and investment in the
                            occupied areas in China. Japanese relations with the United States have
                            steadily deteriorated due to continued interference with American
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister is reported on March 23 as having replied to an
                            interpellation in regard to Japanese-American relations in the Budget
                            Committee of the Lower House of the Diet in which the following
                            statement occurred: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The fundamental cause of Japanese-American relations reaching
                                    their present state, the focal point of which is the China
                                    incident, lies in the failure of the American Government and
                                    people fully to understand Japanese thought and action relating
                                    to the incident. The Government has exerted every effort in this
                                    connection but has not succeeded in having the United States
                                    recognize our real intentions of [<hi rend="italic">or</hi>] the
                                    new situation.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I can only point out in this connection that the American Government’s
                            conception of Japanese thought and actions must necessarily depend upon
                            concrete evidence and according to that evidence it has been found by
                            experience that the definite assurances repeatedly given by the Japanese
                            Government in good faith have not been and are not being carried out in
                            practice. Until implementation is given to these assurances it is not
                            seen how Japanese-American relations can materially improve.</p>
                        <p>It is such implementation that the American Government is constantly and
                            patiently awaiting.</p>

                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In that advice the Japanese
                                        Government stated their view that the presence of the troops
                                        and warships of the belligerent powers in those regions in
                                        China under the control of Japanese forces was liable to
                                        ‘give rise to untoward incidents and to a situation not in
                                        keeping with Japan’s policy of non-involvement.’ This view
                                        the Japanese Government have continued to maintain ever
                                        since.</item>

                                        apprehension of the Japanese Government by reason of the
                                        presence in close proximity of the troops and warships of
                                        the opposing powers that are stationed in Shanghai, Peiping,

                                        Italian troops and warships be voluntarily withdrawn from

                                Ambassador in Japan and the Japanese Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> Strictly confidential oral statement (off the

                        <p>1. In digesting the remarks which Your Excellency made during our
                            conversation on June 10 I am filled with a spirit to endeavor to improve
                            at this time Japanese-American relations and am also prepared to respond
                            with a similarly friendly spirit.</p>
                        <p>2. I gain the impression from Your Excellency’s remarks, however, that
                            the use of military force by Japan in China is the cause or injury to
                            Japanese-American relations. That the United States is not similarly
                            using military force as an instrument of national policy requires no
                            explanation and it is abundantly clear that in view of the causes of the
                            China incident and actual conditions at present Japan is unavoidably
                            using military force. Accordingly, as has been frequently announced,
                            Japan, should reasonable terms be available, is prepared to bring this
                            incident to a close at any time.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, if some way to improve Japanese-American relations is to be
                            found it is essential on the one hand, realizing the necessity of
                            quickly bringing to a close the China incident, to endeavor at every
                            opportunity to effect its termination, and on the other hand, at the
                            same time it is necessary to devote great effort to the solution of
                            other problems. To accomplish this end problems of common interest to
                            Japan and the United States should be studied dispassionately and
                            open-heartedly and I believe the time to be opportune to reach proper
                            settlement of those questions.</p>
                        <p>4. From the above point of view the following problems are worthy of

                        <p>Of late, and no doubt due to some extent to the intensification and
                            spread of hostilities in Europe, there has been a deluge of rumors in
                            regard to the International Settlement and French Concession at
                            Shanghai. Amongst these was a baseless report released by Domei on June
                            5 that negotiations were in progress looking towards the transfer from
                            the French to the American authorities of administrative and police
                            duties in the French Concession. Other rumors have been to the effect
                            that the Japanese military forces at Shanghai might attempt to take over
                            the International Settlement and the French Concession. Needless to say,
                            the Government of the United States does not credit these rumors. In
                            view, however, of the persistence of the rumors and of the consequent
                            uneasiness amongst American citizens and others <pb n="81"

                            reassurance to the foreign communities at Shanghai would be afforded if
                            the Japanese authorities were to make a public statement, in whatever
                            manner they might deem appropriate, in reference to the
                            foreign-administered areas at Shanghai along the general lines of the
                            clear and categorical assurances given by the Japanese Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs to the American Ambassador at Tokyo on May 13,

                            seemed to me to strike the note which underlay my entire presentation,
                            and I felt that these points should be emphasized before proceeding to
                            deal with the bases upon which any such future program could be
                            developed with profit. These two points were as follows: <quote

                            afterward discussed them at length with the Minister in the light of the

                            consideration. Later the Minister slowly and carefully read the papers
                            to himself with a view to obtaining a thorough and correct impression of
                            their contents. He requested me, as had been the case at previous
                            interviews, to leave the papers with him in order that he might give
                            them careful study, and I complied, as I had previously done, on the
                            understanding that the papers were to be considered merely informal

                                <p>The letter dated January 8, 1938, from the Secretary to the Vice
                                    President asserts that the interest and concern of the United
                                    States in the Far Eastern situation and in other similar
                                    situations are not measured by the number of American citizens
                                    residing in a particular country at a particular moment, nor by
                                    the amount of American investments therein, nor by the volume of
                                    trade. There is a broader and more fundamental American
                                    interest—that relating to the maintenance of orderly processes
                                    in international relationships. The United States is deeply
                                    interested in supporting by peaceful means influences
                                    contributory to the preservation and encouragement of such
                                    processes in the Far East—an area containing half the population
                                    of the world. This interest far transcends in importance the
                                    value of American trade with China or American investments in
                                    China. It transcends even the question of safeguarding the
                                    immediate welfare of American citizens in China.</p>

                        <p>I added, however, that the welfare of American citizens and the
                            protection of American just and legal rights in China are also of
                            important concern to the American Government and that I could not

                            cease.</p>
                        <p>The only response made by the Minister, other than to express his
                            appreciation at the opening of these conversations, was that in view <pb

                        <p>I have transmitted to my Government a report of my conversation with Your
                            Excellency on June 10 and have been authorized to say that my Government
                            is giving careful study to it and that it has been impressed by the
                            serious interest which you have displayed in the general subject matter
                            which was under discussion. I have also transmitted to my Government a
                            copy of the text of your strictly confidential statement made to me
                            orally on June 12, which is also being studied by my Government.<note

                                p.m., from the Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_79">p.

                        <p>My Government is of the opinion that before the specific details of any
                            feasible program can be developed with profit, bases therefor should be
                            established by considering carefully the underlying policies and
                            principles which flow from the point of view of each Government, as well
                            as the objectives and hopes of each Government. Superficially it might
                            seem that by laying emphasis upon principles of an abstract nature we
                            are losing from sight the practical aspects. It is our feeling,
                            nevertheless, that if we can first define and take into consideration
                            general objectives and principles, the tendency of this will be to make
                            easier progress in the future looking to a development of measures of a
                            specific nature. For this reason we believe that it might be best for
                            the present to defer specific comment regarding the contents of your
                            statement, and that it would be helpful at this time for my Government
                            to restate broadly its general position.</p>
                        <p>As has been declared before, the hope of my Government has been and
                            continues to be that the unfortunate results of the European war may be
                            reduced to a minimum, not only vis-à-vis the American continent but also
                            as regards Asia, by means of an intensive endeavor on the part of the
                            Governments and peoples of both areas to make secure and to foster their
                            national interests along peaceful lines and by peaceful means, as well
                            as by greater application of those principles and policies which have as
                            their purpose and call for a lowering or the abolition of excessive and
                            artificial obstacles to the movement of trade. We believe it of
                            importance in giving shape to a future trend to look further than
                            considerations of minor and transitory advantage <pb n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84" facs="0150"/>and to keep our attention fixed upon
                            long-range and broad policies based upon the interest which is common to
                            all forward-looking nations. According to our belief, certain
                            fundamentals would unavoidably result from that sort of an approach,
                            some of which are the following: <list>
                                <label>A.</label>
                                <item>A supreme need exists for order, peace, and stability. Our
                                    strong conviction is that the worsening of the general situation
                                    occasioned by the present armed conflicts and those which are
                                    spreading can be halted only by means of an enlightened and
                                    tenacious resistance to such deterioration on the part of those
                                    peoples which hope and have the intention that principles of
                                    national sovereignty, of justice, and of law and order shall
                                    endure; and that principles providing for economic freedom shall
                                    be effective. Provided that Governments and peoples perceive the
                                    essential nature of these principles, and provided that
                                    Governments and peoples desire and are determined to give them
                                    effect, situations of a specific nature in various regions, at
                                    variance with those principles, should, it goes without saying,
                                    be duly rectified and brought into proper adjustment
                                    therewith.</item>
                                <label>B.</label>
                                <item>Also of importance is the matter of what economic principles
                                    and methods of procedure may be deemed best calculated to cause
                                    conditions of general order and safety to prevail and endure. My
                                    Government is committed to a commercial policy which has as its
                                    fundamental basis the principle of non-discriminatory treatment,
                                    and we hold that restrictions upon the exchange of commodities
                                    in international trade should be removed or lowered.
                                    Forward-looking nations might adopt a policy wherein each
                                    country would forego endeavoring to obtain for itself or its
                                    nationals trade rights, commerce or economic exploitation of
                                    third countries of a preferential type, as well as from
                                    employing such influence as it might possess vis-à-vis a third
                                    country to effect the adoption by that country of measures which
                                    might act to withdraw from other countries equality of
                                    commercial opportunity or which might preclude the satisfaction
                                    of legitimate needs of an economic nature.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In order to make progress, it goes without saying, each country concerned
                            must be penetrated with the proper spirit, not excepting a readiness to
                            make sacrifices for the purpose of attaining broad and permanent
                            objectives, and there must accordingly exist, in so far as each country
                            is concerned, the requisite willingness and intention to render possible
                            a realization of basic principles.</p>
                        <p>Every nation without exception is beyond doubt entirely justified in
                            taking all legitimate and reasonable safeguards to enhance and conserve
                            its own security and safety. The fact of taking measures of this sort
                            nevertheless cannot reasonably be made a ground to interfere in other
                            countries or to set up therein systems of special privilege and
                            preferences of an economic nature. My Government has an interest in the
                            commerce and economic development of Far Eastern countries just as has
                            Japan. My Government, accordingly—just as Japan—would not view favorably
                            the infiltration into or the growth in those <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85"
                                facs="0151"/>countries of subversive influences. A general
                            adaptation of the above set forth line of thinking and viewpoint would,
                            we believe, make unnecessary interference in the internal affairs of
                            other nations by any nation, as well as acts by any country in the
                            territory of another looking to the establishment therein of monopolies
                            and other types of special rights. As developments took place
                            conformably to the principles indicated, we might anticipate a
                            multiplication of means of cooperation along many avenues in the general
                            direction of the economic development of countries in need of and
                            requesting such development. The policies and point of view of my
                            Government are so well known and have become so firmly established in
                            the traditional thought and ideals of our people that the intentions and
                            purposes of my country are not difficult to evaluate correctly, nor is
                            the course of action which my Government is likely to pursue under any
                            given set of circumstances. That attitude and the policies mentioned are
                            grounded upon fundamental principles and we are of the belief that a
                            general adherence to those principles which are of universal application
                            would redound to the best interests of my country, of Japan, and of
                            other nations.</p>

                        <p>215. 1. Unless you perceive any objection, it is my desire that at an
                            early moment you call upon the Foreign Minister and in strictest
                            confidence explore with him in continuation of your conversations of
                            June 10 and June 19, the question of possibly arriving at an
                            understanding between the American Government and the Japanese
                            Government through an exchange of notes along the following lines:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The interest of both countries in keeping to a minimum the
                                    adverse effects of the war in Europe is the basis upon which the
                                    understanding would be premised. The understanding would refer
                                    to this interest. In the proposed notes there would be expressed
                                    the agreement between the Government of the United States and
                                    the Japanese Government that they have a common desire that the
                                        <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, except as it may be
                                    modified by peaceful means, be maintained with regard to the
                                    possessions and territories of belligerent European powers in
                                    the Pacific area. There might also be in the proposed notes a
                                    provision for consultation between the Governments of the two
                                    countries should any question arise involving the <hi
                                        rend="italic">status quo</hi> in respect to the Pacific
                                    possessions and territories of belligerent European powers which
                                    renders consultation desirable in the opinion of either the
                                    Japanese Government or the Government of the United States.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>2. In the proposed exchange of notes this Government envisages and would
                            understand the phrase relating to possessions and territories in the
                            Pacific area of belligerent European powers to cover and include their
                            possessions and territories in all parts of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                        <p>3. This suggestion relates to a particular and definite problem, that of
                            averting an introduction of new complications and new possibilities of
                            difficulty and friction into the general situation in the Pacific. As
                            you will realize and will keep constantly in mind, it does not involve
                            and should not be inferred to imply any withdrawal from positions
                            heretofore taken regarding any specific problems in the relationships
                            between the two countries. It is intended as a preventive rather than a
                            curative measure. At the same time, it is our belief, and we hope it
                            will be that of the Japanese, that the possibility of contributing
                            substantially toward making situations better is within procedures which
                            tend to prevent situations from becoming worse. If adopted, we believe
                            this procedure would tend to turn public thought toward consideration of
                            peaceful and constructive processes. It would tend to dissipate various
                            suspicions which apparently prevail among the public and to curtail
                            various types of inflammatory discussion and agitation. It would take
                            care of the particular present and future problem to which it would
                            expressly relate, and, although it would in no way dispose of the many
                            and various specific questions which have been and are the subject
                            matter of current and past discussion between our two Governments, it
                            might facilitate solution of some of them.</p>

                            comment to the Japanese Foreign Office, stating that the Japanese
                            Government is now doubtless aware that the commanders of the British,
                            Italian, and American forces at Shanghai are acting under a signed
                            agreement in regard to liberty areas which was drawn up at the request
                            of the Italian Commander in Chief. The Japanese Government is no doubt
                            also aware of the arrangements made at Peiping and Tientsin in regard to
                            liberty parties which are operating to prevent any disturbance between
                            the Italian forces on the one hand and the British and French forces on
                            the other in those places. Please say also that the American Commander
                            in Chief, in reference to the agreement of the <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88"

                            all concerned, as the representative of a power unengaged in hostilities
                            although he also considered himself to be the senior officer

                        <p>When I called on the Foreign Minister at 11 o’clock this morning at the
                            private house of a common friend, we discussed in strictest confidence
                            the suggestion proposed in the Department’s telegram No. 215, June 22,
                            noon, with reference to an exchange of notes regarding upholding the <hi
                                rend="italic">status quo</hi> with regard to the Pacific territories
                            and possessions of belligerent European countries.</p>
                        <p>The Minister gave his close attention to the diverse points in my oral
                            argument and all the questions he put to me were covered in the
                            Department’s instructions. When asked whether the Pacific mandated
                            islands were included in our proposal, I answered that if he desired I
                            would submit the point to my Government, but he did not pursue the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said finally that the suggestion would be given his close
                            study and that he would reply soon. He stated further that, unless a
                            number of the many outstanding differences between the United States and
                            Japan were first solved, he, offhand and in his own opinion, thought
                            that the suggestion might be difficult to accept. When asked to which
                            difficulties he referred in particular, the Minister replied that the
                            absence of a commercial treaty was the outstanding difficulty.</p>
                        <p>In view of some of his comments I made clear at the conclusion of our
                            talk that our present proposal must not be misunderstood to imply any
                            retreat from positions previously held regarding any particular problems
                            between Japan and the United States, but I added that I found it
                            significant in my own opinion that our exploration today was regarded by
                            my Government as the continuance of the conversations of June 10 and 19,
                            which were entered into with the express intent of discovering means to
                            ameliorate American-Japanese relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arita said that the Japanese press must have called my attention to
                            the trend of public opinion in Japan, which was strongly for <pb n="89"
                                xml:id="pg_89" facs="0155"/>closer relations with Germany and Italy
                            and was continually growing in strength. He claimed that he was
                            personally, as I well knew, in favor of a <hi rend="italic"
                                >rapprochement</hi> with the United States, but that the situation
                            today opened him to severe criticism, and that the problem was extremely
                            difficult.</p>

                        <p>At the request of the Foreign Minister I called on him at nine o’clock
                            this evening at the official residence of the Vice Minister (in order to
                            elude the newspaper correspondents who were then at the official
                            residence of the Minister), and in the ensuing conversation the Minister
                            replied both to my oral statement to him of June 19 and also to the
                            suggestion advanced to him on June 24 concerning an exchange of notes
                            for the purpose of recording the intentions of the two Governments with
                            regard to maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> with
                            respect to the possessions in the Pacific area of the belligerent
                            European powers.</p>
                        <p>As to the conversation of June 19, Mr. Arita said that he had given our
                            oral statement the most careful study and in reply he desired to say
                            that while at first sight it might be held that there were differences
                            between our two Governments, he felt nevertheless that there were “no
                            differences in opinion practically” when one considered the existence of
                            the hostilities now going on in China. The Minister had before him the
                            record of my oral statement of June 19 in which he had underlined
                            certain passages.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Department’s paragraph marked “A” the Minister
                            emphasized his agreement with the views as expressed down to the phrase
                            “shall survive”. (In the paraphrased text presented to the Minister on
                            June 19 and sent to the Department by mail this phrase reads “shall
                            endure”). With regard to the Department’s paragraph marked “B” the
                            Minister expressed agreement with the first two sentences. He said that
                            Japan also has the same policy of non-discrimination.</p>
                        <p>At that point I observed that Japan is not following such a policy toward
                            the United States. The Minister replied that apart from China there is
                            no discrimination against us and that as soon as the hostilities in
                            China cease most but not necessarily all of our grounds for complaint
                            will be removed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arita then handed me his own “oral statement” in reply to my oral
                            statement of June 19 and he said that the Japanese Government entirely
                            agrees with the views of the American Government as therein <pb n="90"
                                xml:id="pg_90" facs="0156"/>presented except in so far as those
                            views might be considered as modified by the statement which he was now
                            handing me. This statement was cabled to the Department in our 510, June
                            28, 11 p.m.<note n="75" xml:id="d53fn75">Telegram No. 510 not printed.

                                printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> The Minister then
                            turned to our conversation of June 24 and said that in consideration of
                            the fact that neither Japan nor the United States is a belligerent, the
                            carrying out of the suggestion for an exchange of notes concerning the
                            maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in reference to the
                            possessions and territories in the Pacific area of belligerent European
                            powers would in his opinion be a somewhat delicate matter. Mr. Arita

                        <p>On the occasion of Your Excellency’s departure for America last year our
                            then Prime Minister, Baron Hiranuma, asked you to carry a message to
                            your Secretary of State,<note n="77" xml:id="d54fn77">See telegram No.
                                234, May 18, 1939, 5 p.m., from the Ambassador in Japan, <ref
                                    target="#pg_1">p. 1</ref>.</note> in which he stated that to
                            save Europe from a disastrous war that would result in indescribable
                            suffering of hundreds of millions of people as well as the complete
                            destruction of civilization was the duty, he believed, of Japan and the
                            United States situated outside the scope of European conflict.
                            Unfortunately the cooperation of our two countries regarding the
                            prevention of war was not realized. However, I am in full agreement with
                            you in the view that we should now exert the greatest efforts toward
                            minimizing the unfortunate results of the European war vis-à-vis America
                            and Asia. In fact, it is because of this conviction on the part of our
                            Government, that they declared their policy of non-involvement
                            immediately following the outbreak of war in Europe last September, and
                            they have strictly adhered to that policy ever since.</p>
                        <p>Japan desires to see all nations enjoy their proper places, and peace
                            established and maintained throughout the world. That is the underlying
                            policies and principles of our foreign relations, and all our efforts
                            are concentrated upon the attainment of these objectives. And in order
                            to preserve peace, it is necessary of course that the principles of
                            national sovereignty, justice, law and order, should be respected, but
                            also, I believe, that all countries should appreciate one another’s <pb
                                n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0157"/>position in the light of the
                            world’s changes and actual conditions. The message of Baron Hiranuma to
                            Mr. Cordell Hull contained the following passage regarding the causes of
                            the pre-war antagonism in Europe: “There may be contentions on both
                            sides, but on cool scrutiny of the European situation since the World
                            War we come to the conclusion that although Germany and Italy may be
                            advised to be more patient, Great Britain and France also have a great
                            deal to reconsider.” To repeat these words, though they refer to the
                            past beyond remedy, may not be altogether unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>Japan has always advocated free movement of both men and commodities.
                            This principle, I regret to say, has been frequently violated and Japan
                            has been obliged to undergo bitter experiences. Immigration is
                            restricted, and markets are opened or closed to suit the convenience of
                            the importing countries, while the importation of the necessities into
                            Japan is prohibited or limited at will by the exporting countries.
                            Though these countries may have taken such steps only as temporary
                            measures dictated by their respective needs, the fact remains that Japan
                            which must seek overseas markets because of her limited domestic trade,
                            and which being deficient in various goods and raw materials must depend
                            upon imports from abroad, finds the situation intolerable. In such
                            circumstance, and especially in the abnormal situation brought on by the
                            gigantic hostilities in China now nearly three years old, it is
                            imperative that Japan should endeavour to preserve certain special trade
                            relationships with neighbouring countries and regions, although she
                            upholds as a fundamental basis for trade the principle of
                            non-discrimination.</p>

                            <item>I have given the most careful study to the proposal which Your
                                Excellency set forth at our meeting on June 24. In view of present
                                international conditions, however, I doubt whether consideration
                                should be given to an exchange of formal notes between our two
                                countries on the basis of a policy of giving effect directly to this
                                proposal. In Europe at the present time hostilities are progressing.
                                Japan is greatly concerned with the effect which the development of
                                the hostilities will have on the status of the possessions and
                                territories in the Pacific area of European belligerent nations.
                                Under this situation, during a transitionary period, for the United
                                States and Japan, which countries are not belligerents, to conclude
                                any sort of an agreement concerning these possessions and
                                territories would, it must be feared, give rise to very delicate
                                relationships for Japan which has taken a position of
                                non-involvement. I am, therefore, endeavoring at this time to offset
                                and to prevent the spread of the European disturbance to the Pacific
                                Ocean and with that purpose in mind and from that point of view, I
                                believe it to be timely and appropriate to consider whether or not
                                there is no room for discussions of problems concerning only the
                                United States and Japan.</item>

                            <item>It is of interest to note that this morning’s papers state that an
                                emergency meeting of the Four Ministers’ Conference was called
                                yesterday afternoon to discuss the proposed declaration of Japan’s
                                policy, that opposition developed among the Ministers to the
                                issuance of such a declaration at this time, and that it was decided
                                that instead of issuing an official declaration of policy the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs should deliver a radio address this
                                afternoon on the general subject of “Japan’s foreign policy in the

                            <item>The text of the radio address as given out today by the Foreign
                                Office is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“International situation and Japan’s position. Japan’s ideal
                                        since foundation of the Empire has been that all nations
                                        should be enabled to find their proper places in world. Our
                                        foreign policy has also been based upon this ideal, for
                                        which we have not hesitated at times even to fight by
                                        staking our national existence. What entire mankind longs
                                        for is firm establishment of world peace. But it goes
                                        without saying that peace can never endure unless it is a
                                        peace in which all nations enjoy their proper places.
                                        Unfortunately, however, establishment of world peace in this
                                        sense is difficult of speedy realization at present stage of
                                        human progress. In order to realize such a great deal,
                                        therefore, it seems to be a most natural step that peoples
                                        who are closely related with each other geographically,
                                        racially, culturally, and economically should first form a
                                        sphere of their own for co-existence and co-prosperity and
                                        establish peace and order within that sphere, and at same
                                        time secure a relationship of common existence and
                                        prosperity with other spheres. The cause of strife which
                                        mankind has hitherto experienced lies generally in the
                                        failure to give due consideration to the necessity of some
                                        such natural and constructive world order and to remedy old
                                        irrationalities and injustices. The war in Europe brings
                                        home the truth of this with special emphasis. Therefore, in
                                        order to establish international peace on a permanent
                                        foundation every effort must be exerted for rectification of
                                        blunders that have been committed in this regard. It is in
                                        this spirit that Japan is now engaged in the task of
                                        establishing a new order in East Asia. It is extremely
                                        regrettable, therefore, that there should be those who not
                                        only fail to understand Japan’s great undertaking based upon
                                        this fundamental principle, but on the contrary, obstruct
                                        establishment of peace in East Asia by supporting regime of
                                        Chiang Kai-shek. We have urged them to reconsider such an
                                        attitude in past, and now we intend further to urge their
                                        serious reflection. We are determined to leave no stone
                                        unturned in order to eradicate all activities for assisting
                                        Chiang Kai-shek. Sometimes there are those who would
                                        disapprove a change in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                        by force of arms regardless of the reasons therefor. It is
                                        for the purpose of bringing about a just and permanent peace
                                        that Japan has been fighting in China for the past 3 years.
                                        Her employment of armed force is an act looking beyond the
                                        immediate present. The sword she has drawn is intended to be
                                        nothing other than a life-giving sword that destroys evil
                                        and makes justice manifest. Countries of East Asia and
                                        regions of the South Seas are geographically, historically,
                                        racially, and economically very closely related to each
                                        other. They are destined to help each other and minister to
                                        one another’s needs for their common well-being and
                                        prosperity, and to promote peace and progress in their
                                        regions. Uniting of all these regions under a single sphere
                                        on the basis of common existence and insuring thereby the
                                        stability of that sphere is, I think, a natural conclusion.
                                        The idea to establish first a righteous peace in each of the
                                        various regions and then establish collectively a just peace
                                        for the whole world has long existed also in Europe and
                                        America. This system presupposes the existence of a
                                        stabilizing force in each region, with which as a center the
                                        peoples within that region are to <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94"
                                            facs="0160"/>secure their co-existence and co-prosperity
                                        and as well the stability of their sphere. It also
                                        presupposes that these groups will respect another’s
                                        individual characteristics, political, cultural, and
                                        economic, and they will cooperate and fulfill one another’s
                                        needs for their common good. When the present European war
                                        broke out, the Japanese Government at once declared their
                                        policy [of] non-involvement and made it clear that this
                                        country did not intend to intervene in Europe and at the
                                        same time did not want to see the war spread into East Asia.
                                        Quite naturally Japan expects that Eastern [<hi

                                        Asia. Japan, while carrying on vigorously her task of
                                        constructing a new order in East Asia, is paying serious
                                        attention to developments in the European war and to its
                                        repercussions in the various quarters of East Asia,
                                        including the South Seas region. I desire to declare that
                                        the destiny of these regions in any development therein, and
                                        any disposal thereof, is a matter for grave concern to Japan
                                        in view of her mission and responsibility as the stabilizing
                                        force in East Asia.”</p>

                        <p>At a private meeting today I acquainted the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            Mr. Arita, fully with the Department’s views regarding the oral
                            statements of the Minister on June 12<note n="83" xml:id="d57fn83">See
                                telegram No. 448, June 12, 1940, 11 p.m., from the Ambassador in
                                Japan, <ref target="#pg_79">p. 79</ref>.</note> and June 28. My
                            remarks were prefaced by the observation that it was my opinion that
                            this communication was one of the most important that I had made to the
                            Japanese Government since I had been Ambassador in Tokyo. The
                            conversation lasted for about an hour.</p>
                        <p>After he had read attentively a second time the record of my oral
                                exposition,<note n="84" xml:id="d57fn84"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Infra</hi>.</note> Mr. Arita picked out that portion which
                            referred to General Chiang Kai-shek and asked whether our comment
                            signified that no change had taken place in our policy of giving support
                            to the Chinese Government at Chungking. My reply was that the passage
                            referred to had exactly the meaning which it said, viz., that my
                            Government recognizes as the Government of China the Government which is
                            at present at Chungking, and that we wish with entire frankness to
                            express the view that there appears to be no probability of solidarity
                            of a united Government for China other than by recognizing a leadership
                            which has the real support of the large majority of the people of China.
                            Mr. Arita remarked that aid to Chungking <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95"
                                facs="0161"/>from France has now been stopped and that the
                            probability exists that British aid will likewise be stopped, which will
                            leave to Chiang Kai-shek assistance only from the United States and the
                            Soviet Union. I brought to the Minister’s attention the obligations of
                            neutrality and stated that the assistance reaching Chungking from my
                            country is a very small proportion of the aid so reaching Japan. The
                            Minister did not pursue the topic further but the fact that he brought
                            it up may be significant of a possible future move in that direction by
                            the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arita said that I might inform my Government that its communication
                            would receive the most careful study both by himself and by the Prime
                            Minister and that he would send us his reply soon. During our
                            conversation I observed that Japan at the present time appeared to be
                            seething with unrest. Mr. Arita acknowledged that that was so and
                            asserted that great pressure is being exerted on the Government to cause
                            it to alter its policy. I replied that I had furnished the Minister
                            today in my communication several basic and comprehensive reasons why it
                            lies in Japan’s best interests to follow a course of good relations with
                            my Government.</p>

                            Japanese-American relations conveyed informally to me by Your Excellency
                            on June 12<note n="85" xml:id="d58fn85">See telegram No. 448, June 12,

                                    79</ref>.</note> and June 28, respectively, and is gratified at
                            the genuinely careful consideration which you have given to my
                            Government’s views expressed by me orally on June 19 last.</p>
                        <p>As I have observed in the course of our recent informal conversations, my
                            Government deems that the situation offered by the present war in
                            Europe, whatever its outcome may be, is a subject for serious concern.
                            Particularly is this so with regard to those countries the prosperity of
                            which depends to a great extent upon foreign commerce. From what you
                            have said to me during our informal conversations, it has become clear
                            that the views of your Government as well as of my own Government are
                            that our foreign trade is of great importance. An examination of the
                            official trade statistics of Japan discloses that during the year 1939,
                            64.9 percent by value of the total exports of Japan were sent to Asiatic
                            countries, and that 21.5 percent went to countries on the American
                            continent, which leaves for the <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0162"
                            />remainder of the world a balance of 13.6 percent. Of the total imports
                            taken by Japan, 40.5 percent by value were derived from countries in
                            Asia, 42.8 percent from countries on the American continent, there
                            remaining from the rest of the world a balance of 16.7 percent. From
                            these figures it is plainly evident that it is in Japan’s interest that
                            there should be averted, in so far as is possible, any extension of
                            developments occasioned by the European hostilities which would bring
                            disturbed conditions from Europe to Asiatic and American countries and
                            diminish the movement of trade between the countries on the continents
                            mentioned and Japan.</p>
                        <p>During the year 1939, of the total exports sent abroad by the United
                            States, Asiatic countries took 17.6 percent by value, and countries on
                            the American continent 35.8 percent. 30.2 percent by value of the total
                            imports into the United States came from Asiatic countries, and 38.7
                            percent from countries on the American continent. It is clear from the
                            foregoing figures that the United States also has a deep interest in the
                            free flow of commerce between it and the nations in both America and
                            Asia. The similarity of Japanese and American interests in commerce may
                            be enlarged still further. A considerable amount of the commerce between
                            countries in Asia and American countries is constituted by the trade
                            between the United States and Japan. To a large extent this commerce is
                            of a complementary nature. Such a healthy and advantageous commercial
                            relationship as the one which has been in effect between Japan and the
                            United States could not thrive under an autarchical system of economy.
                            Moreover, it is a matter of significance that respect for the rights of
                            private property constitutes both in Japan and in the United States the
                            basis of their social and economic pattern.</p>
                        <p>A condition having additional bearing upon the commercial and economic
                            relationships between my country, on the one hand, and, on the other
                            hand, nations on the American continent and Asiatic nations, is the fact
                            that certain of the countries referred to are in need of capital funds
                            for their progressive development, and that in the United States there
                            are funds available for investment in foreign countries. It need hardly
                            be mentioned, nevertheless, that capital is by its nature not readily
                            disposed to take risks and seeks its outlet solely in those areas where
                            circumstances of stability, order, progress, and security prevail.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency observed in your oral statement of June 28 that, because
                            of Japan’s need for markets and sources of supply overseas, it is
                            essential that it should endeavor “to preserve certain special trade
                            relationships with neighboring countries and regions, although she
                            upholds as a fundamental basis for trade the principle of
                            non-discrimination”. It would appear to my Government that it would best
                            serve <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0163"/>the interests of a country
                            in Japan’s position, whose economy has its foundation in foreign
                            commerce, to apply as broadly as possible the principle of equality of
                            trade opportunity and the fullest liberalization of the principle of
                            non-discrimination with relation to trade. An endeavor by one nation to
                            remove particular regions from the applicability of the principles
                            mentioned would unavoidably induce other countries in turn to claim
                            exemption for other areas, resulting in the creation of a number of
                            regional economic blocs having at their foundation discriminations and
                            preferences which could not help being harmful to the interests of the
                            major trading nations. On the contrary, under a system of mutual
                            non-discrimination Japan would not find its commerce restricted to one
                            regional bloc, but would obtain both the profitable results of
                            furnishing to a wide range of markets the wares which Japan is able most
                            efficiently to produce and the corresponding advantage of deriving
                            materials needed by it from the cheapest sources. Under a system of
                            non-discrimination Japan would be better able than under any other
                            international commercial plan to obtain the benefit, in areas in which
                            it has expressed a special interest, arising from the competitive
                            advantage which redounds to it by reason of its geographic propinquity
                            to those areas.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the matter of Japanese policy toward the Netherlands
                            East Indies referred to in paragraph 4, caption (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>), of your oral statement of June 12, my Government has noted
                            from a statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that
                            the Government of Japan is negotiating with the Netherlands and the
                            Netherlands East Indies Government on the question of commerce,
                            enterprise, and the entry into the Netherlands East Indies of Japanese
                            subjects. My Government has noted particularly that, despite the
                            reported declaration of the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies
                            Government that it would take no steps which would result in preventing
                            the exportation to Japan of commodities considered essential by Japan,
                            the Government of Japan has requested that the Netherlands and the
                            Netherlands East Indies Government take suitable measures in order to
                            “definitely assure the export of the desired quantities of required
                                goods”.<note n="85a" xml:id="d58fn85a">See telegram No. 516, June
                                29, 1940, noon, from the Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_289"
                                    >p. 289</ref>.</note> As the Japanese Government knows,
                            Netherlands East Indies products are important in the economy of many
                            countries. The United States carries on important trade relations with
                            the Netherlands East Indies and a substantial American enterprise exists
                            there. As revealed by the statistics of my Government for the year 1937,
                            which was the most recent year for which complete statistics are
                            available, 15.8 percent by value of the total foreign trade of the
                            Netherlands East Indies was with the United States, compared with <pb
                                n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0164"/>11.6 percent with Japan.
                            Accordingly my Government has an important interest in the continuance
                            in the Netherlands East Indies, as well as in other countries, of the
                            principle and the observance of equality of trade opportunity, as well
                            as of that of enterprise. My Government would consequently be
                            appreciative if the Japanese Government would keep it informed as to the
                            manner in which these principles are being applied in the negotiations
                            of the Japanese Government with the authorities of the Netherlands East
                            Indies.</p>
                        <p>Referring to your oral statement of June 28 in which you mentioned the
                            proposal of my Government that an exchange of notes be concluded
                            regarding the continuance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in
                            the possessions and territories of the belligerent European powers lying
                            in the Pacific region, you indicated your belief that for our two
                            countries, which are not belligerents, to enter into any kind of an
                            agreement on this subject would give rise to very delicate relationships
                            for Japan which has taken a position of non-involvement. It would
                            appear, nevertheless, to my Government that the suggested exchange of
                            notes would contribute substantially to rendering secure Japan’s
                            attitude of non-involvement toward the war in Europe, and moreover my
                            Government’s proposal was occasioned by a wish to minimize in the
                            Pacific area the harmful effects of the hostilities in progress in
                            Europe. Indeed, it is my Government’s conviction that in periods of
                            disturbed international relationships reassertion by Governments of such
                            fundamental principles and policies as was intended in the suggested
                            exchange of notes would operate in favor of stability. The fact of the
                            importance of Japan’s commercial relations with the Pacific area, which
                            is indicated by statistics of trade, would appear to my Government to be
                            a cogent reason for the Japanese Government to give favorable
                            consideration to my Government’s suggestion. You have stated that you
                            cannot consider our proposal separately from the conversations which
                            have taken place up to now, and have suggested that, with a view to
                            making further progress in these conversations with respect to this
                            proposal, you be acquainted with my Government’s views concerning the
                            observations contained in your oral statement of June 12. Three problems
                            are enumerated therein as deserving especial study in connection with
                            bringing about an improvement in relations between our two countries.
                            These problems have to do with the economic policy of Japan, present and
                            future, as well as with recent manifestations of aspects of Japanese
                            policy toward China, the Netherlands East Indies, and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>My Government also regards these problems as important and believes that
                            a clarification of the questions posed concerning them is requisite to a
                            consideration of the suggestion contained in caption (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) of the last paragraph of your oral statement referred to,
                            viz., the matter <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0165"/>of the
                            conclusion, as a temporary measure, of a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> between our two Governments. It would therefore be of
                            assistance to have indications as concrete as is possible, concerning
                            the aims and intentions of the Government of Japan regarding points (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), that is, “Is
                            Japan’s economic policy to be to adopt an entirely closed economy?” et
                            cetera, and “Once the hostilities in China have been terminated.,
                            actually to what extent will there remain measures of an exclusive
                            nature in the economic field?” It goes without saying that the earlier
                            there develop manifestations of an implementation by the Japanese
                            Government of its declarations that restrictions at present in existence
                            are of a temporary nature, the more gratified my Government will be.</p>
                        <p>Referring to caption (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the last paragraph of
                            the oral statement of June 12 which brings up the question of assistance
                            to Chiang Kai-shek, my Government quite apart from the fact that the
                            National Government now at Chungking is by it recognized as the
                            Government of China, wishes with the utmost candor to express its
                            opinion that there appears to be no prospect of solidarity of a united
                            government for China other than through recognition of a leadership
                            enjoying the real support of the vast majority of the people of
                            China.</p>
                        <p>My Government has noted the expressed desire contained in your oral
                            statement of June 12, caption (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), that our two
                            Governments act together in order to contribute to world peace. It has
                            also noted the ideal expressed by you in the course of your radio

                            stabilizing force in Eastern Asia. My Government, it goes without
                            saying, would view with sympathy policies and methods which give order,
                            justice, and stability in any area of the world, by peaceful means and
                            having due regard for the interests and rights of all countries and
                            peoples involved. Policies and methods of this nature leave every state
                            in any region completely independent and free to seek normal trade and

                            Methods and policies of this nature are in antithesis to those aimed at
                            obtaining by force economic or political domination for one country in
                            any region.</p>

                        <p>I. The United States Government believes that at this point a
                            clarification by the Japanese Government of its attitude with respect to
                            future commercial policy would, if disclosing a compatibility with our
                                <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0166"/>own views, contribute to
                            accelerating these conversations. Having settled outstanding
                            difficulties with regard to fundamental and broad questions, the details
                            would have a tendency either to fall into place or possibly to be
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>II. It is desired, in connection with the proposed exchange of notes
                            regarding maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of
                            Pacific possessions and territories of belligerent European powers, that
                            there be borne in mind especially the intention to avert new
                            difficulties and friction in the general Pacific situation, and it is
                            hoped that the Japanese Government will share our belief that procedures
                            which tend to prevent situations from deteriorating have within them the
                            germ of contributing materially toward improving situations; that this
                            procedure, if adopted, would tend to dissipate suspicion and curtail
                            inflammatory discussion, thereby turning public thought toward peaceful
                            and constructive processes. It would not only solve the specific problem
                            for which designed, but in addition it might facilitate a solution of
                            some of the other problems between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>III. The United States Government believes that Japan must soon come to a
                            decision regarding two fundamental questions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Will Japan follow a policy and a course of action based upon an
                            attempt to exploit and secure for her own utilization the commerce and
                            resources of territories now impoverished, where living standards are
                            low and capacity for production limited, or will she choose to pursue a
                            course based upon a policy of cooperation with other countries of a
                            similar mind, in order to utilize all available resources of technical
                            skill, capital, and progressive economic leadership with the aim of
                            building up her own economy and that of the more primitive and
                            undeveloped areas?</p>
                        <p>Viewed in historical perspective, the narrower course can bring no
                            assistance or permanent benefit to any country—whatever benefits might
                            accrue being merely of a temporary character. The broader course would
                            increase many times the purchasing power of peoples, would elevate their
                            standard of living, and would bring lasting advantages.</p>
                        <p>(2) The second fundamental choice in the opinion of the United States
                            Government, related to the first, is whether Japan will decide to
                            associate herself with countries committed to a policy of acquiring
                            territory by force. Such a policy might of course denude occupied areas
                            of natural and other forms of wealth, but once gathered, no substantial
                            basis would exist on which to build for economic well-being in the
                            future. It would, moreover, tend to preclude co-operation with other
                            nations in a broad program of social and economic development of a
                            progressive nature in which the capital resources and the technical
                            skill of the various countries concerned would be enlisted.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State, in reply to inquiries by press correspondents for
                            comment in regard to reports that, at the instance of the Japanese
                            Government, the British Government would prohibit temporarily the
                            movement of certain commodities through Burma into China over what is
                            known as the Burma Route, said that this Government has a legitimate
                            interest in the keeping open of arteries of commerce in every part of
                            the world and considers that action such as this, if taken, and such as
                            was taken recently in relation to the Indochina railway would constitute
                            unwarranted interpositions of obstacles to world trade.</p>

                                <p>“Further reference is made to your letter of 8 July. On the
                                    morning of 7 July, 1940, General Nishio, accompanied by a large
                                    number of Japanese officers, made an official tour of the
                                    American defense sector; and the Japanese military held an
                                    official reception at the Pelee Hotel, within the American
                                    defense sector.</p>
                                <p>The Commanding Officer, Fourth Marines, although he had received
                                    no official notification from the Japanese authorities that the
                                    above tour and reception were to take place within the American
                                    defense area, personally met General Nishio and welcomed him to
                                    the American sector, and provided him with an official military
                                    escort.</p>
                                <p>It must be noted that 12 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] July being
                                    the anniversary of the Loukouchiao incident, the Shanghai
                                    Municipal Police had requested the Fourth Marines to operate in
                                    active support of the police and take special precautions
                                    against acts of terrorism or anti-Japanese demonstrations. The
                                    unexpected appearance of the Japanese Commander in Chief,
                                    accompanied by a large Japanese escort, within the sector on
                                    this date created an additional hazard.</p>
                                <p>While General Nishio was attending the reception at the Pelee
                                    Hotel, the Shanghai Municipal Police at about 10:00 notified
                                    Marine Headquarters that a number of strange Japanese in
                                    civilian clothes, thought to be gendarmes, and apparently
                                    carrying concealed weapons, were on Bubbling Well Road, along
                                    the route over which the Japanese General Nishio was expected to
                                    pass soon. The marines felt a high <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
                                        facs="0168"/>degree of responsibility for General Nishio’s
                                    safety as long as he remained in the American sector, and as
                                    these men might be terrorists it was necessary to remove them
                                    and remove them fast. No time was available to communicate with
                                    Japanese authorities to verify these men’s identity and orders
                                    were issued for their arrest.</p>
                                <p>An officer on patrol accompanied by an interpreter and by an
                                    officer of the Shanghai Municipal Police, who pointed out the
                                    suspicious characters, effected the arrests. Some resisted
                                    arrest. All refused to surrender their guns. Identification
                                    cards were produced purporting that the men were members of the
                                    Japanese gendarmerie. However, doubt was cast on this because
                                    the Marine authorities had not been informed that separate
                                    gendarmes would operate in the Marine sector.</p>
                                <p>The suspicious characters were stationed singly at intervals
                                    along Bubbling Well Road, staggered on opposite sides of the
                                    road. In all, 16 arrests were made. As stated above, some
                                    resisted arrest. All refused to surrender their guns. No force
                                    was used other than necessary to arrest these men, and to effect
                                    prompt disarmament of the men in order to prevent their causing
                                    death or injury by the use of their firearms. The marines
                                    effecting the arrests were armed but carried their rifles slung
                                    over their shoulders. The Japanese were transported from the
                                    places of arrest in trucks of the type used to transport
                                    personnel. In many cases the Japanese refused to get into the
                                    truck and had to be bodily lifted therein.</p>
                                <p>General Nishio passed up Bubbling Well Road and left the American
                                    defense sector at about 10:45, without incident. Prior to that
                                    time all of the above arrests had been effected.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese were first detained near regimental headquarters in
                                    a small building used daily by the marines as a lecture room,
                                    gymnasium, and an indoor .22 calibre range. The leader sergeant
                                    major was at once permitted to telephone his superiors. He was
                                    then questioned by the regimental commander. The men, while
                                    detained in this building, were guarded by two sentries within
                                    the building and two outside the building, and a corporal
                                    stationed in the doorway. Rifles were carried loaded and locked.
                                    Bayonets not fixed. No other persons entered this building
                                    except an interpreter and the officer of the day. The
                                    interpreter entered because it was reported by the guard that
                                    the prisoners wanted to say something. It developed that this
                                    something was that one wished to go to the lavatory. He was
                                    conducted to the lavatory.</p>
                                <p>At 11:30, after the names of the men had been secured and their
                                    pistols listed, and as the indoor range did not have proper
                                    facilities, the men were conducted to detention quarters where
                                    they were accorded exactly the same facilities and treatment
                                    given to marines who are detained. They were offered their noon
                                    meal. Some started to eat but were stopped by their leader.</p>
                                <p>Japanese officers called at Marine headquarters and identified
                                    the men as gendarmes. It was explained that the men would be
                                    released whenever a responsible officer signed a release for
                                    them. A major of gendarmes called in the afternoon and talked to
                                    the men and left after praising the fine detention quarters. He
                                    refused to sign a receipt for the release, stating that he did
                                    not have authority.</p>
                                <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0169"/>
                                <p>Finally at 15:00, Major General Miura, commanding officer of
                                    gendarmes, called at Marine headquarters. He expressed his
                                    regret over the incident and stated that it was by accident that
                                    the marines had not been notified, and gave assurances that the
                                    incident would not recur. The men and their arms were released
                                    to Japanese authority. It was agreed between Major General Miura
                                    and the commanding officer. Fourth Marines, that incident was
                                    closed.</p>
                                <p>While the men were detained in detention quarters they were given
                                    the usual routine medical examination. Three had superficial
                                    cuts—iodine cases. One complained of a headache—aspirin
                                    treatment. The memorandum report reads: “All others were
                                    examined carefully, and thoroughly, and there were no other
                                    signs of tissue, bone, or large injuries that could be
                                    elicited.”</p>
                                <p>On the morning of July 8th, Major General Miura addressed a very
                                    courteous letter to the commanding officer, Fourth Marines,
                                    expressing his gratitude that the trip of General Nishio through
                                    the American sector had been completed without delay or
                                    obstruction.</p>
                                <p>On the afternoon of July 8th the Japanese official spokesman at a
                                    press conference made a violent attack against the marines,
                                    accusing them among other things of brutality during and after
                                    the arrests. This was the first intimation the marines received
                                    that there was any thought of undue force having been used.</p>
                                <p>Later, a letter was received from Major General Miura, written on
                                    July 8th, containing practically the same denunciations made by
                                    the press spokesman noted above.</p>
                                <p>An exhaustive investigation was initiated by the Fourth Marines
                                    in an attempt to determine whether or not these denunciations
                                    had any foundation.</p>
                                <p>Major General Miura and Colonel Peck had various conferences in
                                    an endeavor to settle this incident. Finally it was decided that
                                    the settling of the incident would await the termination of the
                                    investigation being conducted by the Fourth Marines.</p>
                                <p>This investigation has now been completed. During the
                                    investigation Japanese authorities were freely consulted. We
                                    wish to thank you for the cooperation given.</p>
                                <p>The investigation does not sustain the charges of undue force and
                                    maltreatment. The statement that the gendarmes offered
                                    absolutely no resistance is not sustained. Most resisted arrest.
                                    All refused to surrender their guns, and struggled, some
                                    violently—striking, butting and kicking at marines. Some marines
                                    received minor injuries such as scratches and bruises. One
                                    marine reports that a gendarme attempted to bite his hand.</p>
                                <p>It is claimed that the gendarmes were forced to squat on the
                                    floor of the rifle range. This claim is not substantiated. It is
                                    true that they were detained in a small building used daily by
                                    the marines as a lecture hall, gymnasium and an indoor .22
                                    calibre rifle range. This building is not provided with chairs,
                                    hence the gendarmes were under the necessity of either standing
                                    or sitting on the floor. This was unfortunate, but the
                                    inconvenience was certainly not great as the men were detained
                                    therein not over an hour.</p>
                                <p>It is claimed that the gendarmes, after being unarmed, were
                                    menaced with loaded rifles. It is true that the guards’ rifles
                                    were loaded and <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0170"/>locked.
                                    But the guards were under competent command and we can find no
                                    verification of the allegation of menacing gestures.</p>
                                <p>The claim has been advanced that one gendarme had his ear pulled.
                                    We can find no verification.</p>
                                <p>It is claimed that the Japanese gendarmes received unfriendly
                                    treatment in the presence of the public in broad daylight. It is
                                    true that the gendarmes were unavoidably forcibly arrested in
                                    the presence of the public in broad daylight, but the public
                                    could not have been generally aware that they were gendarmes
                                    inasmuch as they were in plain clothes.</p>
                                <p>It is claimed that the number of gendarmes injured was 11, in
                                    place of the 3 stated by Marine authorities. In this the
                                    Gendarme and Marine authorities are at variance. Both
                                    authorities are agreed, however, that no serious injuries were
                                    inflicted.</p>
                                <p>Inasmuch as you were kind enough to express to me your regrets
                                    that Japanese gendarmes were operating in the American sector
                                    without proper authorization on July 7, 1940, and to assure me
                                    that the incident would not recur, I have no hesitancy in
                                    expressing to you my regrets that, pursuant to measures we were

                                    the incident occurred, and that some members of the gendarmerie
                                    as well as some members of the marines were unavoidably slightly
                                    injured.</p>

                        <p>The new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Matsuoka, today received the
                            diplomatic chiefs of mission individually in the usual purely formal
                            reception. Instead of the customary five minutes he detained me in
                            conversation for the better part of half an hour.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said at the outset that he had not yet had sufficient
                            opportunity to formulate policy but he wished to say that when the press
                            asked him what his policy was going to be as compared with the Hirota
                            policy and the Arita policy and that of other ministers, he replied that
                            they need look for no so-called Matsuoka policy but only for the policy
                            of Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then asked me to convey to Secretary Hull, for whom he
                            expresses the greatest respect and admiration, the assurance that he has
                            always attached the greatest importance to Japanese-American <pb n="105"
                                xml:id="pg_105" facs="0171"/>relations. The Minister said that he
                            had always been a very frank talker and that in our contacts he might
                            frequently say things which could be regarded as undiplomatic but he
                            believed that much was to be gained by frank and direct speaking. He
                            thereupon referred to an article which he had written some time ago
                            stating that if the United States and Japan ever have to fight each
                            other they should know precisely the causes and reasons for which they
                            were fighting and that war should not develop, as in so many other cases
                            in history, through misunderstanding. I said for my part that I also had
                            no use for old school diplomacy, that I also believed in
                            straight-forward talk, and I believed that the Minister and I would both
                            profit by basing our relations on such an understanding. I thought that
                            we might rule out the word “war”.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that history is based largely on the operation of
                            blind forces which in a rapidly moving world cannot always be
                            controlled. I admitted that blind forces have played their part in
                            history but I added that one of the primary duties of diplomacy and
                            statesmanship is to direct those forces into healthy channels and that I
                            hope before long to explore with him the present state of
                            American-Japanese relations in the confident belief that he and I
                            approaching the subject in the right spirit would accomplish a great
                            deal in giving helpful directive to the blind forces which he had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the Minister if he would care to read the informal record of
                            my last talk with his predecessor, Mr. Arita, in which I had presented
                            various points of view of the American Government, and I hoped that this
                            record might afford a useful basis for our next conversation. The
                            Minister said that he would be very glad to read the record which he
                            accepted and put in his pocket.</p>

                                    several years ago, Mr. Matsuoka, although he at that time held
                                    no position except that of a member of Parliament, had called on
                                    the President <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0172"/>in

                                    friendship arising out of previous association. Mr. Matsuoka
                                    wished now to say to the President privately that his lifelong
                                    desire and interest had been the maintenance of world peace just
                                    as it has been the President’s desire and interest. He said he
                                    had come to realize, however, that since the world is constantly
                                    changing and developing in vivid growth peace cannot be assured
                                    by conforming to the world’s <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>.
                                    The League of Nations failed because its members lacked the

                                    new adjustments to meet such growth and changed conditions. A
                                    new order must come about in the world and world peace must be
                                    based on adapting ourselves to the growth and change which must
                                    inevitably lead to a new order in world affairs.</p>

                        <p>712. Incident of July 7. Reference my 659 [<hi rend="italic">671?</hi>],
                            July 22, 1 p.m. In a letter dated July 25 which has now been translated,
                            Major General Miura states that Colonel Peck’s reply was entirely
                            contrary to his expectations and “absolutely unacceptable for the
                            purpose of settling this incident amicably.” General Miura’s letter
                            which is lengthy and bombastic practically accuses Colonel Peck of bad
                            faith. For example, reviewing some of Colonel Peck’s statements, he says
                            “by these facts, I regret that I have to doubt your sincerity toward the
                            investigation of the facts.” While Colonel Peck’s reply to General Miura
                            was in course of preparation yesterday Rear Admiral Glassford received a
                            letter dated July 28 from Lieutenant Commander [<hi rend="italic"
                                >General</hi>] Fujita, senior military commander in the Shanghai
                            area. A summary of that letter follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The outrageous and impolite conduct which the members of the
                                    United States Fourth Marine Regiment committed in Shanghai

                                    injured the prestige of the Japanese Army and, in spite of
                                    parleys at which the commander of the Japanese gendarmes did his
                                    utmost, we cannot recognize any sincerity or good faith in the

                                    evident facts which are apparent in this incident conflict with
                                    the spirit of justice and righteousness which is the traditional
                                    character of the American military forces? We believe that the

                            with Colonel Peck and myself was despatched to General Fujita last

                                    the 28th instant in regard to what you describe as the
                                    outrageous and impolite conduct which the members of the United
                                    States Fourth Marine Regiment committed in Shanghai against the
                                    Japanese gendarmes on the 7th instant. You inform me that the
                                    prestige of the Japanese Army has been injured thereby and that
                                    in spite of [conferences] at which the commander of the Japanese
                                    gendarmes did his utmost, you cannot recognize any sincerity or
                                    good faith in the measures taken by the American authorities
                                    concerned, to whom you impute deceit and quibbling. You call my
                                    attention to the fact that this incident should be settled as
                                    speedily as possible.</p>
                                <p>It appears that on the 7th instant Colonel de Witt Peck, United
                                    States Marine Corps, commanding the Fourth Regiment of Marines
                                    at Shanghai, a contingent of the Shanghai Defense Forces, had
                                    occasion personally to order the arrest and temporary detention
                                    of 16 members of the Imperial Japanese Gendarmerie who were
                                    within the American defense sector under circumstances which in
                                    the opinion of Colonel Peck warranted the action he took.</p>
                                <p>It develops that as a result of detailed investigations by the
                                    Japanese authorities that the gendarmes are confidently believed
                                    by the Japanese authorities to have been subjected to the use of
                                    unnecessary force and to maltreatment at the time of arrest and
                                    subsequent to arrest. Furthermore, it is represented that the
                                    gendarmes suffered humiliation by their public arrest and
                                    thereby, as well as by the above alleged maltreatment, the
                                    Japanese Army has suffered loss of prestige at the hands of the
                                    United States naval service of which the United States Marine
                                    Corps is a unit.</p>
                                <p>The above allegations of the use of unnecessary force and
                                    maltreatment of the 16 gendarmes are not substantiated, as no
                                    doubt you are aware, by the investigations of this incident
                                    directed by Colonel Peck, who informs me that the investigation
                                    has been exhausted [<hi rend="italic">exhaustive?</hi>] and that
                                    accordingly he is satisfied with its findings.</p>
                                <p>Your imputation of insincerity and lack of good faith in the
                                    measures taken by the American authorities concerned, and your
                                    imputations of deceit by glossing and quibbling over details of
                                    this incident would be intolerable did I not prefer in the
                                    interest of preservation our good relations to consider them as
                                    unexpressed to a flag officer of the United States Navy by an
                                    officer of your high rank, position, and prestige.</p>
                                <p>As senior United States naval officer on the spot I ask that you
                                    permit me to point out that an apology for alleged particular
                                    wrongs under these circumstances cannot be expected. Permit me
                                    to say further that if the Japanese military authorities feel
                                    under all the circumstances of this incident that the Japanese
                                    Army has suffered insult <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0174"

                                    regret that such should be the case. In these expressions of

                                    trust you may see your way clear to take steps to close the

                        <p>I have always said that the mission of Japan is to proclaim and

                            the world. Viewed from the standpoint of international relations, this
                            amounts, I think, to enabling all nations and races to find each its
                            proper place in the world. Accordingly the immediate aim of our foreign
                            policy at present is to establish, in accordance with the lofty spirit
                            of the <hi rend="italic">kodo</hi>, a great East Asian chain of common
                            prosperity with the Japan-Man-choukuo-China group as one of the links.
                            We shall thus be able to demonstrate the <hi rend="italic">kodo</hi> in
                            the most effective manner, and pave the way toward the establishment of

                        <p>In response to inquiries by press correspondents, the Secretary of State
                            made the following statement:</p>
                        <p>“On August 15, at a meeting made necessary by notification that the
                            British defense forces at Shanghai would be withdrawn, the Shanghai
                            Defense Committee voted to assign Sector D in the International
                            Settlement Defense Plan to the Japanese defense forces and Sector B to
                            the American defense forces. This decision was reached by a majority
                            vote, the commanding officer of the Japanese forces voting ‘No’. The
                            majority vote was subsequently approved by the Shanghai Municipal
                            Council. As the American Consulate General <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112"
                                facs="0178"/>and a considerable number of other important American
                            interests are located in Sector B, which sector lies between the present
                            American sector and the waterfront at which American naval vessels are
                            customarily anchored, the Government of the United States gave its
                            approval and informed the Japanese Government that this plan was
                            agreeable to it.</p>
                        <p>“In view of the Japanese dissent, neither Sector D nor Sector B has been
                            taken over by the defense forces. Special protection in Sector B is
                            temporarily being provided by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, pending
                            arrival at an agreement. As this matter is of substantial importance to
                            all concerned, discussions are in progress between this Government and
                            the Japanese Government<note n="96a" xml:id="d68fn96a">See par. (2) of

                            especially to Sector B, and it is the hope of this Government that a

                            assumption of responsibility in Sector D by the Japanese defense forces

                            seven years.</p>
                        <p>The policy of this Government in the Far East has differed in no way from
                            the policies of this country in relation to other regions of the world.
                            It is true, of course, that the problems which have arisen in our
                            relations with the countries of the Far East have had certain
                            peculiarities because of the earlier rights of extraterritorial
                            jurisdiction accorded to the nationals of occidental powers, along with
                            various other special procedures adopted with special reference to
                            special situations, but as situations have changed, the United States
                            has by processes of negotiation and agreement voluntarily assented to
                            the alteration and removal of these special features.</p>
                        <p>From time to time the nations directly interested in the Far East have
                            entered into treaties and international agreements which have created a
                            network of common interests, as well as common responsibilities and
                            obligations.</p>

                        <p>In essence the primary requirements of the United States in the Far East
                            may be thus simply set forth: Complete respect by all powers for the
                            legitimate rights of the United States and of its nationals as
                            stipulated by existing treaties or as provided by the generally accepted
                            tenets of international law; equality of opportunity for the trade of
                            all nations; and, finally, respect for those international agreements or

                            although with the expressed understanding that the United States is
                            always willing to consider the peaceful negotiation of such
                            modifications or changes in these agreements or treaties as may in the
                            judgment of the signatories be considered necessary in the light of
                            changed conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Japan, however, has declared that it intends to create
                            a “new order in Asia”. In this endeavor it has relied upon the
                            instrumentality of armed force, and it has made it very clear that it
                            intends that it alone shall decide to what extent the historic interests
                            of the United States and the treaty rights of American citizens in the
                            Far East are to be observed.</p>
                        <p>As we here well know, many hundreds of incidents have occurred as a
                            result of which the rights of this country and the rights of our
                            nationals have been violated.</p>
                        <p>On April 15 of this year, as a result of developments in the European
                            war, the Foreign Minister of Japan, in a public statement, asserted that
                            Japan desired the maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                            of the Netherlands East Indies.<note n="97a" xml:id="d69fn97a"><hi

                            Netherlands East Indies, and have further specifically declared that
                            this policy applied not only to the Netherlands East Indies, but to
                            French Indochina as well. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding these
                            official declarations, we are all familiar with the events of the past
                            week which have culminated in measures undertaken by the Japanese

                            inquiries, correspondents had earlier in the morning been informed that
                            in view of the abnormal situation continuing in the Far East, the
                            Department, as it had done heretofore in the Far East and in different
                            parts of Europe, was taking precautionary steps for the safety of
                            American citizens by suggesting that especially women and children, and
                            men who are not detained by essential or urgent considerations, consider
                            coming out of various disturbed areas. It was explained that American
                            consular officials were pointing out to American citizens the
                            advisability of utilizing transportation facilities which are now
                            available, and that the Consuls had been asked to inform the Department
                            of the numbers of Americans who were coming out or considering coming
                            out. It was pointed out that this was a continuation of the policy
                            inaugurated in regard to the Far East in 1937 and in regard to Europe
                            last year. It was explained that it applied to Japan, China, Hong Kong,
                            Indochina, Manchuria, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea and

                        <p>962. For the first time in several weeks I went to the country on October
                            9, but the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs (Ohashi) urgently requested
                            me to return to Tokyo so that he might see me, without delay, on behalf
                            of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We talked for about an hour and it
                            was evident that the Foreign Minister is worried on two points: (<hi

                            American Government. I stated that I had no information concerning the
                            first point, and that with regard to the second, advice had been given
                            to Americans in the Far East as a precautionary measure but no “order”
                            had been issued. The “embargo” on iron and steel scrap was referred to
                            by the Vice Minister and I informed him of the substance of paragraphs
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the

                            had received this telegram a few minutes before the conversation.</p>
                        <p>That Japan desires peace with the United States and has no intention of
                            attacking us, was a thesis dwelt upon at length by Mr. Ohashi. I said
                            that the United States feels likewise toward Japan and that, as the Vice
                            Minister knows, the American people are strongly peace-minded, but that
                            both the American Government and people have been made less certain of
                            Japan’s real intentions by inflammatory utterances made recently by
                            Japanese statesmen. I added that the American reaction to those
                            utterances is exactly what should have been expected before the
                            statements were made public, and I mentioned our preparedness program
                            and the inevitable effect on it of the Japanese utterances.</p>
                        <p>Confidentially, I received the clear impression from the nature of the
                            conversation and the marked urgency with which I was called, that the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs is seriously disturbed by the course of
                            developments in the United States resulting from the Japanese
                            Government’s recent actions and statements.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was called “private and off the record” by Mr.
                            Ohashi.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador came in today to say good-bye. He thanked me for
                            my personal courtesies, adding that he regretted the difficult relations
                            now prevailing between this country and Japan, and hoped that they would
                            improve.</p>
                        <p>I said I hoped so, too. I said that I had nothing of course to add to the
                            statement of our position made by Secretary Hull and Mr. Welles, but I
                            did wish to add a personal word, on my own account.</p>
                        <p>There appeared to be a feeling in Japan, and also in other countries,
                            that this country could accept regional divisions based on purely
                            Machiavellian considerations. It was not realized, generally, that this
                            country endeavored to govern by principles to which it held quite as <pb
                                n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0182"/>tenaciously as any totalitarian
                            government. We did not believe in regional or other arrangements based
                            purely on force, politics,. We had challenged the domination attempted
                            by Napoleon; and had maintained throughout all our history the hope of a
                            free world in which relations were carried on under law on a basis of
                            common sense, courtesy and kindness. We were totally unable to accept
                            anything else.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he knew I was perfectly familiar with the
                            Japanese point of view, namely, that they were not seeking domination
                            but merely seeking cooperation, but that once the struggle had begun, it
                            was difficult for statesmen to find a solution.</p>
                        <p>I said that without commenting on that I ventured to express my personal
                            regret that Japan had allowed itself to become tied to the exigencies of
                            a European struggle.<note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1">For text of the
                                tripartite alliance, see <ref target="#pg_165">p. 165</ref>.</note>
                            We had seen the German-Italian alliance, and now saw the Italians in the
                            position almost of prisoner. We had seen the Russo-German agreement, and
                            now Russia was threatened, north, east and west. We saw an apparent
                            domination by force on the continent, and were persuaded that this was
                            the most transitory of arrangements: Europe has seen many such temporary
                            dominations before, and they have never lasted.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador alluded to some of the economic difficulties of Japan.</p>
                        <p>I said that probably the Ambassador was aware that the United States had
                            stood ready at all times, once granted that force politics and conquest
                            were abandoned, to endeavor to assist its neighbor countries so far as
                            possible in all economic ways. We had endeavored to make this clear
                            before the European conflict broke out. I personally hoped that the day
                            might come when once more, dreams of conquest and military power being
                            laid aside, we could begin to discuss possible solutions of economic
                            problems which might ameliorate the life of the individuals for whom
                            governments were, at long last, responsible. I said that I still felt
                            that if that day were ever reached, this country would again stand ready
                            to be of such help as it could.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said, somewhat sadly, that these were difficult times. He
                            hoped relations would improve; meanwhile, he could only hope that those
                            who could look ahead might give wise counsel. Were the war to become a
                            true world war, he felt that it would be not only a tragedy for both
                            countries, but for humanity in general.</p>

                            Office of statement issued by the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            on November 30: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The conclusion by Japan with the puppet organization at Nanking
                                    of what purports to be a treaty is but the culmination of series
                                    of aggression acts on her part designed to overthrow law and
                                    order not only in China, but in the whole Pacific. Having set up
                                    a regime to suit their own purposes, the Japanese have now
                                    signed with it <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0189"/>the
                                    so-called treaty to facilitate the execution of their policy of
                                    domination and expansion in the Far East. Such a regime is in
                                    reality a part of the Government at Tokyo planted on Chinese
                                    soil, to be used by the Japanese militarists as an instrument
                                    for the realization of their scheme.</p>
                                <p>The National Government of the Republic of China has repeatedly
                                    declared, and desires to reiterate most emphatically, that Wang
                                    Ching-wei is the arch-traitor of the Republic and that the
                                    puppet regime at Nanking is an illegal organization whose acts
                                    of whatever character are null and void in respect of all
                                    Chinese citizens and all foreign countries. The so-called treaty
                                    just signed at Nanking is totally devoid of legality and has no
                                    binding force whatever.</p>
                                <p>Should any foreign country choose to accord recognition to the
                                    puppet organization, the Government and people of China would
                                    consider it a most unfriendly act and would be constrained to
                                    discontinue their normal relations with such a country.</p>
                                <p>Whatever Japan may attempt or conspire to do in China or in the
                                    Pacific, China is determined to fight on till victory is won,
                                    and she is confident of victory because to freedom and right and
                                    justice victory inevitably belongs.”</p>

                        <p>It is an honor as well as a pleasure for me to be invited to this
                            distinguished and delightful gathering. I am very happy to take part in
                            this reunion of good old friends who are all devoted to the cause of
                            promoting better understanding between Japan and America. In fact, I
                            feel so comfortably at home among you, that I am tempted to confide you
                            a bit of private information as to how I came to be accorded the
                            treatment, thanks to Admiral Nomura, of a free luncheon in this time of
                            stress and strictly managed economy, and that at the expense of the good
                            members of the America-Japan Society.</p>
                        <p>When I approached Admiral Nomura for the post of Ambassador to the United
                            States, the Admiral, showing not the slightest consideration for our old
                            friendship, was adamant in his refusal. At first it looked hopeless. The
                            obstinate, I might even say obdurate, Admiral stuck to his guns. But I
                            refused to be scared away. I went back at him again and again, and many
                            a friend of both his and mine levelled guns at him. In truth, I pitted
                            my stubbornness against his <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0190"
                            />stubbornness, and as days sped on I became even curious to see which
                            will rub away, his or mine. Finally, at the end of three months’ siege
                            and attack, this stubborn Admiral capitulated. Certainly I was proud of
                            my victory. However, I came very soon to realize that I fought the
                            battle on my own ground, i. e. terra firma, and not in the sailor’s
                            element. That was not fair for the Admiral, but it was a thing on which
                            Japan is to be congratulated and may be for America, too. In any case, I
                            wouldn’t see myself compelled to meet him on the high seas!</p>
                        <p>Admiral Nomura needs no introduction. He is referred to in our press as a
                            “Big Gun.” You know he is in every sense a “Big Gun,” physically and
                            mentally, and feel sure that it is powerful and big enough a gun to
                            shatter any and all possibility or potentiality, if there is any, of
                            clash in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Nomura is not a professional diplomat, and yet he is a highly
                            gifted diplomat. That has been abundantly demonstrated at Washington, D.
                            C. and other posts abroad as well as during the tenure of his office as
                            Foreign Minister in the Abe Cabinet.<note n="5a" xml:id="d76fn5a">August
                                30, 1939–January 14, 1940.</note> He is, moreover, a distinguished
                            sailor, as you all know. Each sail that skims the horizon braves the
                            dangers of the sea and the skipper is responsible for the safety of the
                            entire crew. The very quality that distinguishes a successful sailor, it
                            appears to me, is also the quality needed for a successful diplomat. The
                            vast and deep ocean upon which stately ships move is eminently suited to
                            cultivate a largeness of mind and foster self-confidence and common
                            sense. It builds up, in short, a character that inspires confidence. In
                            the person of our new Ambassador, the American people will find a true
                            Japanese, every inch of that six footer, but at the same time a vehicle
                            of international trust and confidence. We must recover confidence among
                            nations, that is what the world so badly needs at this moment!</p>
                        <p>I am confident that Admiral Nomura will prove a worthy successor to Mr.
                            Horinouchi who, ably assisted by his charming wife, has won the heart of
                            the Americans. Might I be permitted to take advantage of this occasion
                            publicly to tender Mr. and Mrs. Horinouchi my deepest appreciation and
                            thanks for their untiring efforts for the cause of American-Japanese
                            friendship?</p>
                        <p>I think the days of small things are now definitely over. We must think
                            big and act big. It is no time to deal in small change. We must trade in
                            larger currency—or rather, ingots of gold. Namely, we must see eye to
                            eye regarding each other’s position and policy. In this connection, it
                            may not be irrelevant to recall a witty French saying: “an equivalent of
                            Napoleon does not make a Napoleon.” I admit that it is not quite proper
                            to compare Admiral Nomura to Napoleon <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                facs="0191"/>but, for obvious reasons, the French never had a coin
                            named after Nelson.</p>
                        <p>The appointment of Admiral Nomura, I may say, is an eloquent indication
                            of what my Government have in mind in regard to Japan’s relations with
                            the United States of America. I owe it to candor to admit that the
                            relations between our two countries are severely strained at this
                            moment. Now, the causes that have brought about the present unfortunate
                            deterioration are, of course, many and manifold, but the fundamental
                            cause, let me be frank, is American misapprehension of Japan’s aims and
                            aspirations. I shall forego to explain at length our viewpoint, lest I
                            should spoil your appetite. Only let me observe a few words.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to impressions current in America and elsewhere, Japan is not
                            waging an imperialist war of greed and aggression in China. It is not a
                            war of conquest or covetous ambitions. We are engaged in a moral
                            crusade. You may, if you like, ladies and gentlemen, laugh or shrug your
                            shoulders at it, but I am sure time will prove it; fifty years hence, or
                            in less a time, history will testify to it. We are fighting not for
                            destruction but for construction. We are endeavouring to initiate an era
                            of enduring peace and unlimited prosperity, based on justice, equity and
                            mutuality, in Greater East Asia where we firmly believe we have a great
                            mission as the civilizing and stabilizing force.</p>
                        <p>We stand for peace and order. We shut the door nowhere and to none. Any
                            nation that desires to take a hand in this great task is welcome. But
                            mind you, there shall be, “no conquest, no oppression, no exploitation
                            under the New Order which we conceive.” We are as much against Japan
                            herself committing these iniquities in the future. We will not be
                            induced to deflect from our settled course, whatever the pressure or
                            whoever the detractor. This, in short, is the basic attitude of my
                            Government. When I say we must trade in larger currency, I mean to imply
                            that rather than quarrel about minor grievances, we should try to look
                            in a big way at the fundamentals of the situation now confronting
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s ideal, the ideal bequeathed from time immemorial, from the time
                            of the very foundation of the Empire, is to enable all nations to take
                            their proper places in the world. It is my humble opinion that the world
                            should be reorganized and reformed in a more rational way as, for
                            instance, crystals are formed according to the law of nature. Minerals
                            of different nature agree between themselves as to which of them shall
                            give way to the other at their junction, and take their permitted shapes
                            and allotted shares of space, yielding or being yielded to, as they
                            build up a perfect crystal. When the international society is
                            crystalized in a similar manner in accordance <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0192"/>with the spirit of justice and equity,
                            then and then only will a genuine and lasting peace prevail throughout
                            the world. The new order we envisage is a realization of such an
                            international society, which we intend to begin by setting up in this
                            part of the world under our leadership. The Pact of Alliance recently
                            concluded by Japan, Germany and Italy points to the same goal.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this world of ours is too wide politically and too
                            narrow economically. While economic activities should be world wide and
                            should suffer no limitation, our political efforts had better be
                            restricted to only those spheres in which we are vitally interested, and
                            not be extended to other people’s domains. If regional peace is
                            effectively secured through regional understanding, the world will, by
                            its aggregation, be able to enjoy a universal peace. This has been my
                            idea all through since the adoption of the Covenant of the League of
                            Nations at the Versailles Conference. The recent Havana Conference is a
                            case in point, being an attempt to ensure peace and order in the Western
                            Hemisphere through a regional cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the Three Power Pact, a section of the American people have,
                            wilfully or otherwise,<note n="*" xml:id="d76fn6">In Japanese as
                                “maliciously.” [Footnote on file copy evidently inserted by the
                                American Embassy in Japan.]</note> misunderstood our purpose and are
                            accusing Japan of harboring hostile intentions toward America. Nothing
                            can be more absurd and untrue. Japan has no desire whatsoever to
                            antagonize America, or for that matter, any nation. We want to maintain
                            and even enhance our friendly relations with all nations.</p>
                        <p>We only desire, on one hand, to be left alone, so that we may carry on
                            our constructive work unhindered, and on the other hand, to see the
                            trouble in China and the war in Europe brought speedily to an end,
                            without adding more participants, particularly such a powerful one as
                            America. Imagine just for a moment that America joined the European war
                            or came to a clash with Japan in the Pacific. What then? If any bit of
                            human feeling or an atom of instinct for self-preservation is left in
                            you, ladies and gentlemen, wouldn’t you shudder at the very thought?
                            Would not a kind of ice-water shoot down your spine?</p>
                        <p>There would loom up every chance of facing at last the Armageddon that
                            would end in a total destruction of our culture and civilization. I do
                            beseech my American friends to think twice, thrice, nay, ten, hundred or
                            thousand times before they take a leap that may prove fatal to all
                            Humanity. In this connection, I wish to leave no doubt whatever in the
                            mind of any American citizen the fact that Japan is, and will remain,
                            loyal to her Allies; that Japan’s foreign policy will revolve in the
                            future around the Three Power Pact as its pivot, as it <pb n="127"
                                xml:id="pg_127" facs="0193"/>did around the pivot of the
                            Anglo-Japanese Alliance in the past when that Alliance was in force.
                            This, of course, implies no threat. It is a simple statement of truism
                            made in order to prevent possible misapprehension. For, an illusion on
                            an issue like this will bring no good to anyone.</p>
                        <p>At this point, permit me to refer only cursorily to the China problem.
                            After all, the fate of China is largely a question of sentiment to the
                            Americans, but to us it constitutes a truly vital issue affecting, as it
                            does, the very existence of our Empire. We are confident regarding the
                            future and are not without hope as to an early restoration of peace in
                            China which by the way, will automatically liquidate the difficult
                            situation which has engendered the present tension between Japan and
                            America. In this sense, the new Chinese Central Government at Nanking
                            may be regarded as the harbinger of better times, “Daffodils that come
                            before the swallow dares.” It is my firm conviction that once the basic
                            and broader aspect of the situation is rightly taken in by the
                            Americans, they will not only not oppose our endeavors but will even
                            join efforts with us in furthering our high aims. My proposition is that
                            we, both of us, shall not blink at realities, however unpalatable they
                            happen to be, but shall try earnestly and honestly to understand each
                            other’s position with sympathy and in a spirit of mutual accommodation.
                            For this, we must clear our mind of cant and avoid the folly of “rubbing
                            the sore when one should bring the plaster” which sometimes thoughtless,
                            not to say malevolent, people are apt to do.</p>
                        <p>The public is often the dupe of public opinion. Giddy minds and foreign
                            affairs make an undesirable company. Some people simply cannot think of
                            international relations but in terms of clash and conflict. Somehow they
                            cannot think in terms of concord and co-operation. There are pessimists,
                            not to say alarmists, in both countries who believe in the inevitability
                            of a major conflict in the Pacific. That would surely spell the downfall
                            of mankind. Do we not owe it to Humanity, both Japan and America, to
                            unite our efforts and do our best to avert such an awful calamity?</p>
                        <p>In wishing God speed to Admiral Nomura, I pray most fervently, that he
                            may successfully fulfill his mission which is to usher in a happier
                            period of mutual trust and better understanding between our two great
                            nations. Waves may rise high in the Pacific Ocean but we trust in the
                            courage and resourcefulness of Admiral Nomura as a skillful and tried
                            seaman safely to take us to the port. Neither shall we forget the fact
                            that although we only see the white sail tossing on the rough sea, the
                            ship does not lose its balance because of the ballast which remains
                            invisible to our eyes. That ballast is the common sense of our two
                            peoples.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0194"/>
                        <p>And so I close this address with an earnest appeal to the common sense of
                            our two peoples to maintain calm judgment and quiet self-restraint, in
                            the face of the appalling and unprecedented world situation. Let us keep
                            our heads clear and cool. Let us go slow and take time. Let us try to
                            learn and make sure. There is ample time for us to think and make up our
                            mind. Eternity before us, why over-hurry? Half a century is but a
                            passing moment and will fill merely one brief paragraph in a history
                            book.</p>
                        <p>Is it too much for Japan to ask for so much of a minute, just half a
                            century or even less, in which to prove herself to the world? Time is
                            the great curer of human travail. Let us all have a bit of patience.
                            This is my appeal.</p>

                                Gentlemen</hi>,</p>
                        <p>I am a plain sailor. I was brought up amid tall masts and crowded sails,
                            and am accustomed to rough seas. I am, however, a complete stranger to
                            the elegant society, its speech and its manner. In spite of my brief
                            experience as Foreign Minister, I am not meant to be an Ambassador.
                            Indeed, a sailor is quite helpless on the land; he is reduced to perfect
                            impotence, like a stranded boat. In the tangled wood of diplomacy, he
                            would be just as good as lost. Being well aware of my ignorance how to
                            shine in graceful society and how to walk upon the tight rope of
                            diplomacy at this critical juncture, I first declined Mr. Matsuoka’s
                            kind offer although I greatly appreciated it as a mark of confidence
                            which I know I hardly deserve. I held out as long as I could and then
                            gave in. I could defeat an Invincible Armada but not Mr.
                            Matsuoka—because he refuses to acknowledge his defeat.</p>
                        <p>However, both the Foreign Minister and I were agreed to one thing from
                            the first: the necessity of improving drastically the relations between
                            Japan and America which have deteriorated so much of late. I felt
                            frankly disturbed by the ominous trend of affairs which, if left
                            unchecked, may possibly bring about an acute tension between the two
                            countries who have no reason to quarrel but every reason to remain
                            friends. After much hesitation, therefore, I decided to accept the
                            offer, rather in the heroic spirit of a common soldier who is called to
                            the Colours. Swim or sink, survive or perish, I do not care. Only am I
                            anxious to serve—serve the cause of better understanding between our two
                            nations.</p>

                            hostile bases but as stepping stones of goodwill between the two shores

                        <p>In once more expressing to His Excellency the Foreign Minister the
                            appreciation of the Society of his giving of his valuable time to join
                            us today, I wish to thank the Minister on behalf of us all for his
                            enlightening address. My own comments on his address will be restricted
                            to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency has brought out certain points with which we must all
                            agree, especially with Mr. Matsuoka’s expressed desire for peace, his
                            appeal for calm judgment and his good wishes for the success of Admiral
                            Nomura’s mission. Other points brought out were of a controversial
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>I cannot deal severally with those points today. Yet with all due respect
                            I must relieve the Minister of his misapprehension that the interest of
                            the American people in China is largely sentimental. I am particularly
                            glad to take note of the Minister’s statement that in the Japanese
                            program the door is to be shut nowhere and to no one and that this
                            program envisages no conquest, no oppression, no exploitation.</p>
                        <p>The Minister has lived long enough in the United States to know that the
                            American people are fundamentally peace-minded and furthermore that they
                            stand for justice and equity. He also knows that the American people are
                            firmly determined on certain matters among which on the one hand are
                            their obligations and on the <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0196"
                            />other hand their rights. Their profoundest wish is to see peace,
                            prosperity, security, stability and happiness assured to all
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>In the present state of world affairs we must inevitably realize that
                            what counts in international relationships today, and what we all have
                            to face in formulating our several opinions, is the concrete evidence of
                            facts and actions, regardless of the persuasive garb in which such facts
                            and actions may be dressed.</p>
                        <p>Let us say of nations as of men: “By their fruits ye shall know
                            them.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee on Foreign
                                Affairs</hi>: We are here to consider a bill designed to promote the
                            defense of the United States. I shall not discuss the technical details
                            of the proposed measure, since that will be done by other departments of
                            the Government more directly concerned with these matters. I shall place
                            before you briefly the controlling facts relating to the manner in which
                            the dangers that now confront this Hemisphere and, therefore, this
                            nation have arisen, and the circumstances which render imperative all
                            possible speed in our preparation for meeting these dangers.</p>
                        <p>During the past eight years, our Government has striven, by every
                            peaceful means at its disposal, to secure the establishment in the world
                            of conditions under which there would be a reasonable hope for enduring
                            peace. We have proceeded in the firm belief that only if such conditions
                            come to exist will there be a certainty that our country will be fully
                            secure and safely at peace. The establishment of such conditions calls
                            for acceptance and application by all nations of certain basic
                            principles of peaceful and orderly international conduct and
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in the conduct of our foreign relations, this Government has
                            directed its efforts to the following objectives: (1) Peace and security
                            for the United States with advocacy of peace and limitation and
                            reduction of armament as universal international objectives; (2) support
                            for law, order, justice, and morality and the principle of
                            non-intervention; (3) restoration and cultivation of sound economic
                            methods and relations, based on equality of treatment; (4) development,
                            in the promotion of these objectives, of the fullest practicable measure
                            of international cooperation; (5) promotion of the security, solidarity,
                            and general welfare of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>Observance and advocacy of the basic principles underlying these
                            policies, and efforts toward their acceptance and application, became
                            increasingly important as three nations, one after another, made <pb
                                n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0198"/>abundantly clear, by word and
                            by deed, their determination to repudiate and destroy the very
                            foundations of a civilized world order under law and to enter upon the
                            road of armed conquest, of subjugation of other nations, and of
                            tyrannical rule over their victims.</p>
                        <p>The first step in this fatal direction occurred in the Far East in 1931
                            with forceful occupation of Manchuria in contravention of the provisions
                            of the Nine Power Treaty and of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The equilibrium
                            in the Far East which had been established by the Washington Conference
                            treaties of 1921–1922 became seriously disturbed by the setting up by
                            forceful means in a part of China of a regime under Japanese control
                            under the name of “Manchukuo”. This control over Manchuria has been
                            marked by the carrying out of a policy of discrimination which has
                            resulted in forcing out American and other foreign interests.</p>
                        <p>During the years that followed, Japan went steadily forward in her
                            preparations for expansion by force of arms. In December 1934, she gave
                            notice of her intention to terminate the naval treaty of February 6,
                            1922. She then proceeded with intensified construction of military and
                            naval armaments, at the same time undertaking, from time to time,
                            limited actions directed toward an extension of her domination over
                            China and involving disregard and destruction of the lawful rights and
                            interests of other countries, including the United States.</p>
                        <p>In July 1937, the armed forces of Japan embarked upon large-scale
                            military operations against China. Invading forces of more than a
                            million men occupied large areas along the seaboard and in the central
                            provinces. In these areas there were set up puppet regimes which
                            instituted systems of controls and monopolies discriminatory in favor of
                            the interests of the invading country.</p>
                        <p>It has been clear throughout that Japan has been actuated from the start
                            by broad and ambitious plans for establishing herself in a dominant
                            position in the entire region of the Western Pacific. Her leaders have
                            openly declared their determination to achieve and maintain that
                            position by force of arms and thus to make themselves masters of an area
                            containing almost one half of the entire population of the world. As a
                            consequence, they would have arbitrary control of the sea and trade
                            routes in that region.</p>
                        <p>Previous experience and current developments indicate that the proposed
                            “new order” in the Pacific area means, politically, domination by one
                            country. It means, economically, employment of the resources of the area
                            concerned for the benefit of that country and to the ultimate
                            impoverishment of other parts of the area and exclusion of the interests
                            of other countries. It means, socially, the destruction of personal
                            liberties and the reduction of the conquered peoples to the role of
                            inferiors.</p>
                        <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>It should be manifest to every person that such a program for the
                            subjugation and ruthless exploitation by one country of nearly one half
                            of the population of the world is a matter of immense significance,
                            importance, and concern to every other nation wherever located.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the course which Japan has followed during recent years,
                            this Government has made repeated efforts to persuade the Japanese
                            Government that her best interests lie in the development of friendly
                            relations with the United States and with other countries which believe
                            in orderly and peaceful processes among nations. We have at no time made
                            any threats.</p>

                        <p>125. A member of the Embassy was told by my … colleague that from many
                            quarters, including a Japanese one, he had heard that a surprise mass
                            attack on Pearl Harbor was planned by the Japanese military forces, in
                            case of “trouble” between Japan and the United States; that the attack
                            would involve the use of all the Japanese military facilities. My
                            colleague said that he was prompted to pass this on because it had come
                            to him from many sources, although the plan seemed fantastic.</p>

                        <p>126. Foreign Minister Matsuoka’s remarks in the session of the House of
                            Representatives Budget Committee yesterday, first published here this
                            morning, are summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The time has passed for Japan and the United States to engage in
                            arguments but since the interpolator has raised the question, certain
                            points in Secretary Hull’s statement require clarification. His
                            statement is based on erroneous thinking and his language is violent.
                            The assertion that the Manchurian incident was the first step toward
                            destruction of civilization is based on a superficial point of view. <pb
                                n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0200"/>Rather, the Anglo-Saxon support
                            of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in East Asia, except [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] when such <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                            was injurious to Japan, must be blamed. Chinese resistance must be in
                            large part attributed to Anglo-Saxon encouragement. An extremely
                            generous Japanese policy served only to make the Chinese think that
                            Japan would suffer all insults. Traditional Japanese patience was
                            finally exhausted and the Marco Polo Bridge attack carried out.</p>
                        <p>2. American statesmen do not want to understand Japan’s policy. We are
                            endeavoring unsuccessfully to urge the Americans to reflection. “Since
                            the United States has no correct understanding of Japan’s thoughts and
                            actions we have no recourse but to proceed toward our goal. We cannot
                            change our convictions to accommodate the American viewpoint. There is
                            nothing left but to face America, though we shall continue without
                            disappointment or despair to try to correct the fundamental
                            misconceptions held by that nation.”</p>
                        <p>3. During the tenure of the two previous Cabinets there seemed to be some
                            effort on the part of the American Government to reach an understanding
                            with Japan. Mr. Hull is pardoned on this point. However, it has become
                            evident that American conditions are the withdrawal of Japanese troops
                            from China and abandonment of [<hi rend="italic">or?</hi>] 50%
                            curtailment of Japan’s continental and southward advance policies. “Not
                            one Japanese in the Empire would assent to the abandonment of these
                            policies.” This American demand is equivalent to Japan’s offering
                            friendship to America in return for abandonment of the Monroe Doctrine,
                            admission that predominance in the Western Hemisphere is wrong and
                            immediate granting of independence to the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States seems to consider all of Asia and the South Seas as
                            first line of defense. Japan’s domination of the Western Pacific is
                            absolutely necessary to accomplish her national ideals. “My use of the
                            word ‘dominate’ may seem extreme and while we have no such designs,
                            still in a sense we do wish to dominate and there is no need to hide the
                            fact. Has America any right to object if Japan does dominate the Western
                            Pacific?”</p>
                        <p>“As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I hate to make such an assertion, but I
                            wish to declare that if America does not understand Japan’s rightful
                            claims and actions, then there is not the slightest hope for improvement
                            of Japanese-American relations.” Japan will still not give up the small
                            hope remaining that a change in American attitude can be brought
                            about.</p>
                        <p>5. America’s stiffened attitude may be partially attributed to an
                            illusion that Japan’s military power is weakened, and to the rumors that
                            certain influential quarters in Japan secretly oppose the tripartite
                                pact<note n="8" xml:id="d81fn8">See <ref target="#pg_165">pp.
                                    165</ref> ff.</note> and say that Japan will not follow its
                            obligations even though the United States should enter the war. However,
                            the provisions of article 3 of the treaty will come into effect in
                            almost every case except that of an overt German attack upon the United
                            States. If the treaty is invoked after consultation of the three powers
                            it is not believed that Japan will without reason take the narrow
                            viewpoint and for its own selfish advantage remain an onlooker in the
                            war even though it means staking the fate of the nation on the
                            outcome.</p>

                        <p>6. Relations with Soviet Russia have considerably improved. An agreement
                            has been reached to open negotiations for an important treaty. England
                            and America are watching the progress of Japanese-Soviet relations with
                            the greatest interest.</p>

                        <p>167. The Foreign Minister yesterday discussed Japanese-American relations
                            in reply to interpellations in the Budget Committee of the House of
                            Representatives. Since we are informed that the <hi rend="italic">New

                            Matsuoka’s remarks, the principal points made by the Foreign Minister as
                            reported in today’s vernacular press are summarized. During the course
                            of the interpellation the Foreign Minister emphasized that his
                            statements were not irresponsible remarks but were based on careful
                            thought, that his bold manner of speech was particularly adapted to
                            American consumption. He stated that Japan must clarify its true
                            intentions and national power, that American illusions regarding Japan
                            must be dissipated and that every effort to avoid a Japanese-American
                            clash must be exerted.</p>

                                and occupied the country the Japanese nation would rise again even
                                as Germany emerged from the harsh conditions imposed at the end of
                                the first World War and the Foreign Minister reportedly reiterated
                                that a clash between the two great Pacific powers must be avoided

                        <p>196. In connection with the last sentence in paragraph No. 1 of telegram
                            No. 126 of January 27 from the Embassy, the Ambassador states that the
                            Liutiaokow and Lukouchiao incidents were confused due to an unfortunate
                            error in translation. The Japanese Foreign Minister’s reference was not
                            to the Marco Polo Bridge or Lukouchiao incident of July 7, 1937, but to
                            the incident which occurred at Liutiaokow on September 18, 1931. The
                            following is a translation of the statement: “The traditional patience
                            of the Japanese finally was exhausted and the blow was dealt at
                            Liutiaokow.” The phraseology used by Mr. Matsuoka does not necessarily
                            assert that the Japanese made the original attack. There is not
                            available any official text of the statement and the reports appearing
                            in the various newspapers differ slightly from the text sent to the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>235. Tonight’s vernacular press gives prominence to a statement issued at
                            noon today by the Cabinet Information Bureau appealing to Japanese
                            living in the Americas to remain calm in the face of <pb n="137"
                                xml:id="pg_137" facs="0203"/>propaganda intended to worsen
                            Japanese-American relations, under such headlines as “No Cause Anxiety
                            Japan America; Government Statement Intended Allay Uneasiness”; “Third
                            Country Plot Seen Behind Exaggerated Rumors Japanese-American Crisis.”
                            The press states that the Cabinet statement on the Far Eastern
                            situation, the new American evacuation advice, and exaggerated rumors
                            hinting at a Japanese-American crisis have unduly alarmed Japanese
                            living on the American continent. This false propaganda is attributed to
                            a “certain foreign country.”</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s translation of the statement handed to us by the Cabinet
                            Information Bureau follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Reports indicate that sensational information has been
                                    circulated in all parts of the American continent to the effect
                                    that Japanese-American relations are becoming extremely critical
                                    and that anxiety and uneasiness apparently exist among Japanese
                                    living in those areas. Although Japanese-American relations are
                                    somewhat strained they have not reached a point where war or
                                    hostilities are inevitable. Under the circumstances the
                                    governments of both nations are of course acting judiciously
                                    that such a contingency does not develop. It is believed that
                                    the spreading of extremist propaganda to worsen relations
                                    between the two countries is an act (the press version states
                                    ‘of certain countries’) based on an ulterior motive. The
                                    Government strongly desires that Japanese living in the various
                                    parts of the American continent maintain to the utmost a calm
                                    attitude, following their occupations without the slightest
                                    anxiety or agitation.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                            memorandum of conversation which the Counselor of the Embassy had on
                            February 14 with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, the substance of
                            which was reported to the Department in the Embassy’s 230, February 14,
                            8 p.m.<note n="9" xml:id="d86fn9">Telegram No. 230 not

                        <p>The presentation by Mr. Dooman of his impressions of the position of the
                            United States as gathered during his recent furlough appeared to cause
                            Mr. Ohashi astonishment. Mr. Ohashi is, for a Japanese, extraordinarily
                            direct and sparing of words. Upon listening attentively to what Mr.
                            Dooman described as the philosophy of the American position, Mr. Ohashi
                            remained perfectly quiet for an appreciable space of time and then burst
                            forth with the question “Do you mean to say that if Japan were to attack
                            Singapore there would be war with the United States?” Mr. Dooman
                            replied, “The logic of the situation <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138"
                                facs="0204"/>would inevitably raise that question.” Mr. Ohashi then
                            left that subject and adverted to the character of the reports sent to
                            London by the British Ambassador. Circumstantial evidence that Mr.
                            Ohashi was affected by the interview was given by Sir John Latham, the
                            Australian Minister, who called on Mr. Ohashi a few minutes after Mr.
                            Dooman left. Sir John, without being aware that Mr. Dooman had just
                            called on Mr. Ohashi, told me that he found Mr. Ohashi greatly agitated
                            and distrait.</p>
                        <p>I propose to say to Mr. Matsuoka, with whom I have an appointment this
                            morning, that the statements made by Mr. Dooman to Mr. Ohashi were made
                            with my prior knowledge and have my full approval.</p>

                            <p>I called this afternoon by appointment on Mr. Ohashi, the Vice
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs. He greeted me quite politely, saying
                                that although we had several mutual friends it was, so far as he
                                knew, the first time we had met. I replied that I had on various
                                occasions taken notice of statements which he had made in various
                                capacities of the past, in Manchuria, and elsewhere, but I had,
                                unfortunately, not been able to profit by opportunities which had
                                presented themselves to make his acquaintance. Mr. Ohashi said he
                                understood that I had just returned from leave in the United States
                                and that he supposed I had received a number of interesting
                                impressions in the United States. I replied that my furlough in the
                                United States coincided with one of the most significant and
                                important periods in the history of our country, and that if he had
                                time I would be glad to tell him briefly of what I had seen and
                                heard while at home. Mr. Ohashi said that fortunately he was not
                                busy that day and that I could stay as long as I wished.</p>
                            <p>I gave Mr. Ohashi a fairly long account of the trends in opinion with
                                regard to the war in Europe as they developed during the election
                                campaign. I dwelt on the remarkably swift crystallization of opinion
                                at home with regard to the question of American aid to England,
                                which I attributed in large part first to the disclosure on the part
                                of the British that they were rapidly approaching the end of the
                                resources in dollar exchange, and second to the belief that the
                                effects on Britain’s capacity to produce aircraft and other
                                munitions of German bombing raids had been more serious than the
                                British communiques would lead one to suppose. I said that although
                                the large majority of the American people abhorred the idea of
                                American <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0205"/>involvement in
                                war, the fact was that an equally large majority of the American
                                people believed that there was one consideration which transcends
                                even that of avoiding involvement in the war, and that is helping
                                England to the limit of our capacity.</p>
                            <p>I said that all this was not without direct bearing on relations
                                between the United States and Japan. I had found that American
                                opinion is pretty clearly opposed to the taking of action by the
                                United States which would make war with Japan inevitable.
                                Nevertheless Mr. Ohashi could readily understand that the American
                                people, being an eminently practical people, are quite aware that an
                                adequate supply of airplanes and other munitions is not the only
                                prerequisite to a British victory: the supply to England of
                                foodstuffs and raw materials by the British dominions and colonies
                                and the maintenance of British commerce with the outside world are
                                equally essential to a British victory. It would be absurd to
                                suppose that the American people, while pouring munitions into
                                Britain, would look with complacency upon the cutting of
                                communications between Britain and British dominions and colonies
                                overseas. If, therefore, Japan or any other nation were to prejudice
                                the safety of those communications, either by direct action or by
                                placing herself in a position to menace those communications, she
                                would have to expect to come into conflict with the United States.
                                There are many indications of the Japanese moving down slowly toward
                                Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. The United States cannot
                                but be concerned by the various initiatives taken by the Japanese in
                                Indo-China and elsewhere, for the reason that if Japan were to
                                occupy these strategically important British and Dutch areas, it
                                could easily debouch into the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific and
                                create havoc with essential British lines of communication. The
                                United States for its part was well aware that an alternative source
                                of supply for Japanese purchase of petroleum and certain other
                                products of the United States is the Netherlands East Indies, and
                                for that reason it has been reluctant to impose embargoes on the
                                sale to Japan of commodities of which it has a surplus; but the
                                Japanese must clearly understand that the forbearance of the United
                                States in this respect springs from a desire not to impel Japan to
                                create a situation which could lead only to the most serious
                                consequences, I recalled the axiom in geometry that two bodies
                                cannot occupy the same space at the same time: However greatly
                                Japan’s security might be enhanced by occupying the Netherlands East
                                Indies it must be realized by Japan that any such move would vitally
                                concern the major preoccupation of the United States at this time,
                                which is to assist England to stand against German assault.</p>
                            <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0206"/>
                            <p>Mr. Ohashi then took the floor and launched into an impassioned
                                apologia of Japanese policies in recent years. He started by
                                describing conditions in Japan during the middle 20’s, the lack of
                                employment in Japan at that time was driving young Japanese to
                                despair; communism began to spread in amazing fashion, the estimates
                                being that there were at one time more than 50,000 Japanese
                                communists and there was fear of decay and disintegration of the
                                Japanese political system. There developed at the same time a
                                growing antagonism in China toward Japan. General Chiang Kai-shek
                                initiated a series of military campaigns which finally resulted in
                                the downfall of the northern group of Chinese generals, including
                                Feng Yu-hsiang, Yen Hsi-shan, and others. General Chang Tso-lin<note
                                    n="9a" xml:id="d86fn9a">Reference is to Chang Hsueh-liang, son
                                    and successor of Chang Tso-lin.</note> made his historic trip to
                                Nanking to consolidate himself with General Chiang Kai-shek, and
                                upon his return to Mukden he raised the flag of Chinese nationalism
                                and proclaimed that his action manifested the complete unification
                                of China and at about this time, Mr. C. T. Wang, then Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, publicly declared in a speech at Nanking that China
                                was now prepared to “drive Japan off the Continent of Asia”. There
                                had occurred elsewhere other events which also gave grounds for
                                complete pessimism in Japan. Pressure by the United States on
                                England had led to the abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese alliance,
                                which England discarded after it had served British purposes; the
                                United States in 1924 excluded Japanese from emigrating to the
                                United States, even though the granting of a small quota of 140
                                would have amply served to prevent Japanese pride and honor from
                                being injured, and when Australia followed with its White Australia
                                Policy and other parts of the British Empire had also taken action
                                to exclude Japanese, the Japanese had found themselves effectively
                                prevented from expanding into areas which could use their industry
                                and initiative. At the same time the United States and Great Britain
                                encouraged China in every possible way to implement the policy
                                proclaimed by Dr. C. T. Wang to drive Japan off the Asiatic
                                Continent. He recalled travelling with Admiral Kanji Kato in 1930
                                from Mukden to Japan. Admiral Kato expressed himself as being
                                extremely despondent of the future if matters were allowed to
                                proceed as they were then proceeding, and he disclosed to Mr. Ohashi
                                the determination of certain elements in the Japanese Army and Navy
                                to take action toward opening up a way for Japanese expansion. This
                                determination manifested itself finally in the Mukden Incident of
                                September 18, 1931. Mr. Ohashi said that the League of Nations had
                                placed upon Japan the responsibility for seeking to alter by force
                                the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in the Far East. However, it
                                was clear that it was China and not Japan which had taken the
                                initiative in seeking to alter the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi>, and the responsibility for the <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141"
                                    facs="0207"/>deplorable conflict now taking place between China
                                and Japan must largely be borne by those nations which encouraged
                                China to pursue this disastrous policy. The United States and
                                England must also be responsible in some measure for Japan’s
                                aligning itself with Germany and Italy, for the present
                                Sino-Japanese conflict would never have occurred if the
                                Anglo-Japanese alliance had not been abrogated. The United States
                                and England had further driven Japan into a position of complete
                                isolation, and it was accordingly necessary for Japan to find
                                friends. Japan has no special friendly feelings towards Germany and
                                Italy and certainly has no ideological association or identity with
                                either of those two countries. Nevertheless Germany, Italy, and
                                Japan have a close identity of interests in revolting against
                                attempts to keep them permanently under subjection. It would be a
                                great mistake to suppose that Japan would not honor its commitments
                                under the alliance if the United States “were to attack
                                Germany”.</p>
                            <p>I observed that Mr. Ohashi’s presentation of Japan’s case had the
                                eloquence of one suffering under a sense of grievance. We do not
                                deny that Japan has grievances, but we object to the methods pursued
                                by Japan to rectify those grievances. After the war in Europe is
                                over, there is bound to be a more rational world, and in the
                                creation of the more intelligent world economy which we must
                                earnestly hope will be brought into being after the war, there would
                                be ample room for entirely satisfying Japan’s legitimate needs. I
                                then quoted Mr. Churchill’s<note n="10" xml:id="d86fn10">British
                                    Prime Minister.</note> remark “If we allow the past to quarrel
                                with the present, we shall lose the future”. As difficult and
                                important as were the problems arising in China, they had not led to
                                a war between the United States and Japan. It was certainly not the
                                intention of the United States to seek a war with Japan, but at the
                                same time I wished to make it clear that it would be idle and
                                extravagant to believe that, so long as Japan remained a partner of
                                Germany and Italy and so long as she was unable to resolve her
                                troubles with China on a mutually satisfactory and equitable basis,
                                a stabilization of relations between the United States and Japan
                                could be hoped for. I believed that it was quite possible to pass
                                over the present critical period without war, but that one essential
                                condition to this more or less happy issue out of our difficulties
                                must be the realization on the part of the Japanese that they cannot
                                substantially alter the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in
                                Southeast Asia, particularly, without incurring the risk of creating
                                a very serious situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ohashi asked whether he was correct in understanding me to say
                                that war could be averted only by Japan standing still and allowing
                                itself to be tied hand and feet by the United States and Great
                                Britain. I replied that it was not my intention to give him
                                specifications <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0208"/>as to what
                                Japan should or should not do, but I wished to express my opinion
                                that if Japan did not exercise the same degree of restraint and
                                forbearance as that being exercised by the United States, it was
                                very difficult to see how a war could be averted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ohashi then asked me whether we had been sending to Washington
                                such extravagant and sensational reports as those being sent by Sir
                                Robert Craigie to London. Without waiting for a reply he said that
                                Mr. Eden<note n="11" xml:id="d86fn11">British Secretary of State for
                                    Foreign Affairs.</note> had recently called in the Japanese
                                Ambassador at London and had talked to Mr. Shigemitsu very harshly
                                about recent Japanese moves in Siam and Indo-China. Mr. Eden was
                                apparently greatly excited by telegrams which he had received from
                                Sir Robert Craigie. Mr. Ohashi said that he had just had a talk with
                                Sir Robert Craigie and that he had reminded Sir Robert that he had
                                repeatedly given the latter assurances that Japan had no intention
                                whatever of moving toward Singapore and the Dutch East Indies unless
                                Japan was “pressed” by other nations through the imposition of
                                embargoes by the United States or by the sending of an American
                                fleet to Singapore. I said to Mr. Ohashi that, in my opinion, the
                                award by Japan to Siam of the provinces of Laos and Cambodia would
                                undoubtedly lead to the most serious disorders in Indo-China, as the
                                French are strongly opposed to any substantial cession of territory
                                to the Siamese. I asked Mr. Ohashi what Japan would do in the event
                                that the disorders were beyond the French to control. He replied “we
                                shall have to suppress these disorders”. I then went on to say “once
                                having occupied Indo-China, Japan would be in a position to control
                                Siam and to undertake operations toward Burma or the Malay States.
                                You see how this intervention in Southeast Asia is capable of having
                                the most widespread consequences”. I asked whether he should not
                                consider, in the light of Japanese intervention in the dispute
                                between Indo-China and Siam, whether alarm over Japanese policies in
                                this area is not justified. Mr. Ohashi protested that Japan’s
                                interests in Southeast Asia were predominantly economic. Was it our
                                intention to prevent Japan from entering into more satisfactory and
                                closer economic relations with Indo-China and the Netherlands East
                                Indies? I replied that we were not concerned with arrangements
                                calculated to be mutually profitable and which were entered into
                                freely and not as a result of demands with menaces, open or implied.
                                He would understand that proposals concerning trade arrangements
                                presented under the guns of naval vessels could hardly be regarded
                                as ordinary trade arrangements. Mr. Ohashi said that no Japanese
                                warships were in the Indies and that the commercial negotiations now
                                being carried on by Japan with the Netherlands Indies and Indo-China
                                were of a normal character.<note n="11a" xml:id="d86fn11a">For other

                            <p>Mr. Ohashi said that he was awaiting with great interest reports
                                which Admiral Nomura would be sending in shortly of his forthcoming
                                interviews with the President and the Secretary of State.<note

                                        387</ref> ff.</note> I had then been in Mr. Ohashi’s office
                                more than an hour. I rose to go. I said that upon my return to Tokyo
                                I asked various colleagues what sort of a man Mr. Ohashi was and
                                that they had all replied that he was extremely frank—that some had
                                added that he was frank to the point of unpleasantness. I went on to
                                say that I was very glad that he had been both frank and courteous
                                with me, and that he could count on me to maintain equal frankness
                                and courtesy with him in our future conversations. A faint smile
                                came to Mr. Ohashi’s face and he said that he would be glad to
                                receive me at any time.</p>

                        <p>334. Yesterday I told Matsuoka that I entirely concurred in and approved
                            of all that Dooman had said to Ohashi on February 14. As the latter had
                            given only an oral report of the conversation to Matsuoka I read him the
                            whole memorandum of it. I was somewhat surprised when the Minister
                            stated his entire agreement with what Dooman had said. Today I am
                            sending Matsuoka for his personal use a copy of the memorandum.</p>

                        <p>581. This morning I was given the opportunity, by invitation of the
                            Japanese Ambassador, to talk with Matsuoka<note n="13" xml:id="d88fn13"
                                >Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, on special mission to the

                        <p>Matsuoka was emphatic in stating that under no circumstances would Japan
                            attack Singapore or any of the American, British, or Dutch possessions,
                            and he was insistent that Japan has no territorial ambitions. Japan, he
                            said, was ready at any moment to join the United States in a guarantee
                            of the territorial integrity or independence of the Philippine Islands.
                            As an evidence of Japan’s lack of territorial ambitions, Matsuoka
                            referred to the outcome of his mediation of the dispute between Thailand
                            and French Indochina. He said that Japan would not go to war with the
                            United States, and added that from his reading of American history it
                            appeared that it was the United States which went to war with other
                            countries; if a conflict should take place, it would come about only as
                            the result of affirmative action by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Matsuoka said that he desired ardently to liquidate the war in China at
                            the earliest possible date. Chiang Kai-shek was relying upon American
                            help, he said, and any time the President of the United States wanted to
                            bring the Sino-Japanese conflict to an end on terms satisfactory to all
                            concerned, he was in a position to do it by bringing his influence to
                            bear in this direction upon Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                        <p>I asked him whether he had in mind terms which he was sure Chiang
                            Kai-shek would be entirely willing to accept and which would meet with
                            the President’s approval. He replied that instructions had recently been
                            sent to Nomura<note n="14" xml:id="d88fn14">Japanese Ambassador in the
                                United States.</note> to take the subject up with the President and
                            to discuss with the latter the terms on which the Sino-Japanese war
                            could be terminated. Matsuoka said that now was the time when statesmen
                            should take decisive action and that it is the “big things, not the
                            little things” that matter; in his opinion the President is afforded a
                            splendid opportunity “to clear up the entire Far Eastern situation” by
                            discussing with Nomura the terms on which the war in China could be
                            brought to a close. He added that he wished the President and the
                            Secretary of State would trust him; on his record over the past few
                            years, he said, he did not blame them for not having confidence in him,
                            but that if they would give him the opportunity he would prove to them
                            that Japan had no territorial or economic ambition, and that if an
                            understanding were reached regarded by us all as reasonable he would
                            fight to put it through should any elements in Japan oppose it.</p>
                        <p>In reply to what he had first said, I merely suggested to Matsuoka that
                            he instruct Nomura most explicitly as to exactly what was in his mind as
                            a basis for ending the war with China, and that he leave nothing open
                            either to chance or to misunderstanding. Again he was emphatic at this
                            point in insisting on the acceptability of the terms which he had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>Matsuoka characterized as “ridiculous” any fears which were expressed in

                            these commodities were obviously for consumption in the only market that
                            was large enough to absorb them; namely, the United States. It would be
                            folly, he said, to interfere with the export of these commodities to the

                        <p>673. 1. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has been suffering from
                            bronchitis and still coughs badly, received me today for the first time
                            since his return from Berlin and after completing the routine business I
                            asked whether he had any particular thoughts with regard to the present
                            general situation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Minister’s subsequent remarks, which he said he was addressing to
                            me as “an American friend and not as the American Ambassador” were
                            bellicose both in tone and substance. He said that he was exceedingly
                            worried lest the United States should proceed to convoy its ships to
                            Great Britain, which would almost certainly lead to war with Germany. He
                            said that to declare a neutral zone in the Atlantic or any other ocean
                            was contrary to international law and that in the face of our supplying
                            Great Britain with war materials he thought that Hitler had shown great
                            “patience and generosity” in not declaring war on the United States. He
                            said he knew that Hitler desired to avoid such a war but that it was
                            doubtful whether his patience and restraint could continue indefinitely.
                            He said by way of example that if the United States were to convoy its
                            ships in bringing aid to Chiang Kai-shek they would be torpedoed by the
                            Japanese Navy just as he would expect the American Navy to act similarly
                            in a reverse situation. He said that if, in spite of previous
                            forbearance, Hitler should not [<hi rend="italic">now?</hi>] sink our
                            ships in the Atlantic and if we Americans should then attack the German
                            submarines he would regard this as an act of American aggression which
                            would call for <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0212"/>deliberation as
                            to the applicability of article III of the Triple Alliance Treaty of
                            September 27, 1940,<note n="16" xml:id="d89fn16"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_165">p. 165</ref>.</note> and he
                            thought there was no doubt that such deliberation Would lead to war
                            between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Thin issue he said, therefore, lies exclusively in the hands of President
                            Roosevelt. Mr. Matsuoka added that in view of the present American
                            Government and actions he felt that the “manly, decent, and reasonable”
                            thing for the United States to do was to declare war openly on Germany
                            instead of engaging in acts of war under cover of neutrality. He
                            developed the foregoing thoughts at considerable length but the main
                            points brought forward were as stated above.</p>
                        <p>3. I rebutted each of Mr. Matsuoka’s remarks in turn and said that
                            whether he was speaking to me as the American Ambassador or not, I as an
                            American citizen emphatically resented his charge that my country was
                            guilty of unmanly, indecent, and unreasonable conduct. Mr. Matsuoka
                            thereupon said that he would withdraw that remark. To my reference to
                            Japan’s actions in attacking China and in ruthlessly bombing undefended
                            cities and populations without a declaration of war (in connection
                            [with] the Minister’s observation anent the failure of the United States
                            to declare war on Germany) Mr. Matsuoka merely remarked that the
                            situations were entirely different, and changed the subject. I pointed
                            out the utter fallacy of Mr. Matsuoka’s reasoning with regard to our
                            alleged breach of international law, spoke of our consistent policy
                            concerning the freedom of the seas and argued the full justification of
                            such measures as we might put into force in the face of Hitler’s
                            continual breaches of international law with special reference to the
                            illegal form of submarine warfare being waged by the Germans. I
                            explained at length our policy of supporting Great Britain and the
                            compelling reasons which had led us to adopt that policy. No point of
                            course by Mr. Matsuoka was allowed to pass unchallenged but we finally
                            agreed that such debate was profitless and that a meeting of minds was
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>4. The discussion then turned to Japan’s policy in connection with the
                            southward advance and I said that in spite of the Minister’s constant
                            assurances of peaceful intentions we realized that there were other
                            schools of thought in Japan as exemplified by the writings and speeches
                            of many highly placed Japanese who were openly advocating that the
                            southward advance should be carried out by force.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that he deplored the sort of utterances which I had
                            mentioned as much as he deplored all anti-foreign agitation in Japan
                            which he was steadily working to put an end to. He said that he was
                            dissatisfied with the lack of energy on the part of Mr. Ito, President
                            of the Information Board, in failing to eliminate the publication of
                            such utterances and he proposed to have a talk with him on <pb n="147"
                                xml:id="pg_147" facs="0213"/>this subject shortly. If necessary the
                            Minister said that he was prepared to place a definite ban on the
                            publication of material of this kind. Prince Konoye and he himself were
                            determined that the southward advance should be carried out only by
                            peaceful measures but he added significantly “unless circumstances
                            render this impossible.” I asked him what circumstances he had in mind.
                            He replied that he had in mind especially the concentration of British
                            troops in Malaya and other provocative British measures. When I pointed
                            out that such measures were purely of a defensive nature and that Great
                            Britain certainly had no intention of provocative or of aggressive
                            action in the Far East but had been obliged to adopt these defensive
                            measures as a result of concrete evidence indicating that Japan’s
                            intentions to the southward might not be peaceful at all, the Minister’s
                            reply was that these British measures were regarded as provocative by
                            the Japanese public and if the public should become too much disturbed,
                            pressure might be brought to bear on the government to act. So far as
                            the attitude of the Government of the United States was concerned I
                            pointed out to the Minister situation would be utter folly for us,
                            having adopted a policy of supporting Great Britain, to supply Great
                            Britain by the Atlantic while complacently watching the downfall of
                            Britain through the severance of the British lifeline from the East. The
                            potentialities of this situation were therefore of grave concern to the
                            United States and this concern must be increased in the light of the
                            Minister’s remark that Japan’s peaceful intentions were dependent upon
                            “circumstances.”</p>
                        <p>5. In the course of further conversation I said that it was a constant
                            cause of regret to me that Japanese-American relations were for the
                            moment negative and non-constructive; that I had steadily worked to
                            build up something permanently constructive in our relations and had
                            been very hopeful of attaining concrete results during the period of the
                            Yonai Cabinet<note n="16a" xml:id="d89fn16a">January 16–July 16,
                                1940.</note> and it had been a profound disappointment to me that
                            Japan’s complete change of policy had made these efforts abortive. I
                            said I still look forward to the day when only [<hi rend="italic"
                                >once</hi>] again our two countries could begin to reconstruct their
                            relations on a firm basis. The Minister replied that he also was
                            constantly hopeful but he added that the whole future of the world and
                            of civilization now lies in the hands of one single man, President
                            Roosevelt. My last remark before the termination of the interview was
                            that the United States could only be guided by deeds and that our future
                            relations must depend not upon what Japan might say but upon what Japan
                            might do.</p>
                        <p>6. Just as I was about to despatch this telegram I received a letter from
                            Mr. Matsuoka written in his own hand. The letter (except for <pb n="148"
                                xml:id="pg_148" facs="0214"/>one paragraph referring to a protection
                            case which I took up with him) reads as follows: <quote

                                <p>“Dear Mr. Ambassador … I was wondering, to be frank, why you
                                    appeared so disturbed when I referred to the American attitude
                                    and actions. After Your Excellency’s departure, it all suddenly
                                    dawned on me that I misused a word (of course I was not speaking
                                    in my own language and you must make some allowance for my
                                    occasionally making mistake in choosing words, particularly when
                                    I speak off hand). Of course, I didn’t mean to say ‘indecent.’
                                    No! I wanted to say ‘indiscretion.’ What I wished to say (and
                                    that not as Foreign Minister but as a man who regarded himself a
                                    quasi-American and felt could talk almost as if he were an
                                    Ambassador) was that I should have liked to see the American
                                    Government exercise more discretion and be careful to give an
                                    appearance of ‘reasonableness;’ in a word, to be more cautious
                                    and careful.</p>
                                <p>I write you the above in order to remove any misapprehension; I’d
                                    feel very sorry if I caused any.</p>
                                <p>Very sincerely yours, Y. Matsuoka.”</p>

                                    construction of the East Asia co-prosperity sphere and are
                                    trying to enjoy the dream of exploitation of East Asia at the
                                    cost of the 1,000 million populace of the East Asiatic peoples
                                    to satisfy their greed of possession.</p>

                                    promising young men in his futile resistance against Japan is
                                    only due to the desire of Britain and the United States to fish
                                    in the troubled waters of East Asia by putting [<hi

                                <p>“The world at present is confronted with unprecedented
                                    disturbances. In greater East Asia, however, the close relations
                                    among Japan, Manchukuo, and China must be strengthened to the
                                    utmost on the basis of the principles of the Japan-China basic
                                    treaty and the Japan-Manchukuo-China joint declaration. Needless
                                    to say, we must proceed towards the establishment of a new order
                                    in East Asia which has the co-existence and co-prosperity of
                                    East Asia peoples as its basic principle.</p>
                                <p>In its negotiations with the United States, the Japanese
                                    Government consistently has upheld this principle. The United
                                    States, however, is inclined not to recognize the real situation
                                    in East Asia. Not only that, but also it most regrettably has
                                    shown a disposition to apply coercively to the East Asiatic
                                    countries fanciful principles not adapted to the actual world
                                    situation and thus to obstruct the construction of the new
                                    order.</p>
                                <p>In undertaking the great mission of firmly establishing a new
                                    order in East Asia and thus contributing to the cause of
                                    permanent world peace, we must be fully prepared to face
                                    difficulties and obstacles greater than ever before.</p>
                                <p>I firmly believe however that if the three countries, Japan,
                                    Manchukuo, and China with iron will strengthen their ties and
                                    strive for realization of this great object in perfect
                                    cooperation, they will surmount these various obstacles, and
                                    that the East Asia peoples have a great future.”</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">The Foreign Office issued the following statement at
                            10:00 p.m. November 25, 1936, on the Japanese-German Agreement and the
                            Supplementary Protocol guarding against the Communist International.</p>
                        <p>(1) Ever since its establishment the Communist International, or the
                            so-called Comintern, with its headquarters at Moscow, for the purpose of
                            destroying the national and social structures in every country in
                            pursuance of its fundamental policy of world revolution, has been
                            engaged in all sorts of activities, greatly menacing the peace of the
                            world. At its Seventh Congress held in the summer of last year, the
                            Comintern decided upon a policy of organizing a unified front with the
                            Second International to oppose Fascism and imperialism, and at the same
                            time made it plain that the future objectives of Comintern activities
                            were to be Japan, Germany and Poland, etc.; and it further resolved to
                            support the Chinese communist armies in order to fight Japan. The actual
                            operations carried on subsequently by the Comintern have become
                            extremely ingenious, rendering them all the more dangerous. As to the
                            extent to which the Comintern interferes with the internal affairs of
                            all countries and exerts baneful influences on the well-being of the
                            nations and the peace of the <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0222"
                            />world, a glance at the present disturbances in Spain will be
                            sufficient to convince anybody of its magnitude. At least those
                            countries which lodged protests with the Government of the Soviet Union
                            at the time of the Comintern Congress must certainly have full
                            cognizance of the harmfulness of Comintern activities.</p>
                        <p>(2) The communist invasion has hitherto been more marked in the Orient,
                            especially in China. The Outer Mongolia and Sinkiang have already
                            suffered from its calamitous effects while China Proper is now being
                            subjected to the depredations of the communist armies. The activities of
                            the Comintern in China have, as a matter of fact, notably increased in
                            vigor since its Seventh Congress.</p>
                        <p>In Manchukuo, also, the Comintern has been surreptitiously endeavoring
                            through the Manchurian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
                            to organize cells, to win over and instigate the bandits, and to direct
                            the raids by partisan troops all over the country.</p>
                        <p>In Japan, the extreme Leftist movement temporarily showed signs of
                            decline after the Manchurian Incident. But since the Seventh Congress of
                            the Comintern, the movement has again become energetic. It has crept
                            into the channels of lawful agitation in conformance with the resolution
                            of that Congress, and has launched a unified front movement to make it a
                            basis for the revival of the communist movement.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Japanese Government, who, in order to safeguard Japan’s immutable
                            national polity and insure the national security, and to maintain an
                            everlasting peace in East Asia have pursued a clear-cut and consistent
                            policy toward the Comintern, find it necessary to take more rigorous
                            measures of self-defense against its increased menace as stated above.
                            The organization and the activities of the Comintern being of an
                            international character, any program of counter action should
                            necessarily be based upon international cooperation. Now Germany, ever
                            since the establishment of the present regime in 1933, has put into
                            execution drastic anti-communist policies. Last year at the Seventh
                            Congress of the Comintern she was selected together with Japan as a
                            special objective of Comintern operations. Thus Japan and Germany are
                            placed in similar circumstances vis-a-vis the Comintern. Consequently
                            the Japanese Government as the first step of their defensive undertaking
                            conducted negotiations with Germany and concluded an agreement on
                            November 25 to take effect immediately.</p>
                        <p>(4) This agreement, the fundamental object of which is common defense
                            against the destructive operations of the Comintern, contains provisions
                            for the exchange of information regarding Comintern activities, for the
                            consultation on, and the execution of, defensive <pb n="157"
                                xml:id="pg_157" facs="0223"/>measures and for the extension of joint
                            invitations to third Powers. There is, besides, a supplementary Protocol
                            stipulating in concrete terms the manners of executing the present
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>(5) The Japanese Government are desirous of co-operating with as many
                            Powers as possible for the purpose of perfecting their defensive
                            measures against the Comintern menace, but for that purpose alone. It
                            should be pointed out that in connection with, or behind, this agreement
                            there exists no special agreement whatsoever, and that the Japanese
                            Government have no intention to form, or join in, any special
                            international bloc, for any other purpose and finally that the present
                            agreement is not directed against the Soviet Union or any other specific
                            country.</p>

                                    23, 1936</date>.</dateline></opener>
                        <p>I called on Mr. Horinouchi at the official residence of the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs at 5 o’clock at Mr. Horinouchi’s request. After the
                            usual greetings Mr. Horinouchi stated that there were many rumors in
                            Tokyo and in the press abroad regarding a German-Japanese agreement—some
                            said a German-Japanese military alliance. Because of these rumors he
                            wished to tell me the facts as they stand at present. He then said that
                            at the last general meeting of the Comintern Japan, as well as Germany
                            and the United States, had been specified by the Comintern as countries
                            against which that organization should direct its activities. As was
                            well known, Japan did not like and was opposed to communistic doctrines
                            and has always defended Japan against the spread of communism. Recently,
                            moreover, the activities of the Comintern apparently have not been
                            directed as much against countries in Europe as against countries in
                            Asia, particularly against China, India, and Manchuria. Now that the
                            activities of the Comintern have assumed an international scope the
                            Japanese Government has adopted the policy that international defense
                            against the activities of the Comintern should be taken by the countries
                            threatened by those activities.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons which he had just stated, the Vice Minister went on, the
                            Japanese Government has been holding conversations with the German
                            Government during recent months. These conversations have resulted in an
                            agreement. The Vice Minister then gave me the following summary of the
                            German-Japanese agreement: <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0224"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The exchange of information in regard to the activities of the
                                    Comintern and consultations in regard to defensive measures, as
                                    well as provisions for extending joint invitations to third
                                    powers, are provided for by the agreement. Concrete provisions
                                    concerning the carrying out of the agreement mentioned above,
                                    the manner of cooperation between the authorities of the two
                                    high contracting parties, the steps to be taken against persons
                                    connected with the Comintern, and the establishment of a
                                    standing committee, are embodied in a Supplementary
                                    Protocol.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Vice Minister stated that the agreement would probably be concluded
                            sometime during this week and upon conclusion would be published. I
                            asked if the protocol as well as the main agreement would be published.
                            The Vice Minister said that it would.</p>
                        <p>The Vice Minister went on to say that the agreement was not directed
                            against any particular power. Moreover, he said, the Japanese Government
                            had no intention of permitting the agreement to draw Japan into European
                            politics and Japan had no intention of joining any bloc of nations—for
                            instance any bloc such as a fascist bloc.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that rumors were current in diplomatic circles in Tokyo to the
                            effect that the agreement included some secret trade or military clause.
                            Mr. Horinouchi immediately said that the agreement was not an alliance
                            and that no secret military or economic arrangement of any kind was
                            included in the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Horinouchi then said that he was giving this information about the
                            German-Japanese agreement only to the American and to the British
                            Governments. He said that the British Ambassador, Sir Robert Clive, had
                            informed the Foreign Office that questions had been asked in the House
                            of Commons in regard to the rumors of a German-Japanese agreement and
                            that, for that reason, the Foreign Office had informed the British
                            Ambassador in regard to the agreement. He proceeded to state that the
                            Japanese Government greatly valued its friendship with the American
                            Government and did not wish that any misunderstanding should arise, and
                            consequently he had decided to give the same information to the American
                            Government. I thanked Mr. Horinouchi for the information, which I said I
                            knew would be greatly appreciated by my Government, especially in view
                            of the many conflicting and probably exaggerated press reports which
                            were reaching the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Horinouchi said that, as the information regarding an agreement was
                            being given only to the above two governments, he had to request that it
                            be kept strictly confidential for the time being. Before the agreement
                            was given to the newspapers, however, he would give me a complete text
                            for transmission to my Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the adherence
                        of Italy to the German-Japanese anti-Comintern pact took place at Rome on
                        November 6 and that the news was tailed in this country with great
                        enthusiasm. Not only did the press comment extensively and with approval, as
                        reported by telegram,<note n="*" xml:id="d94fn1">Telegram No. 528, November
                            8, 5 p.m., 1937. [Footnote in the original; telegram not
                            printed.]</note> but streets were decorated and parades were held in
                        celebration of the event. By this step Italy has thus forged the third side
                        of the German-Italian-Japanese anti-communist triangle and has definitely
                        placed Japan in the so-called fascist block of nations. This event further
                        marks the definite termination of Japan’s period of political and moral
                        isolation which followed the Manchurian venture in 1931 and also emphasizes
                        the abandonment of Japan’s previous and almost traditional alignment with
                        the democratic powers.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has, in a previous despatch,<note n="†" xml:id="d94fn2">Despatch
                            No. 2631, October 15, 1937. [Footnote in the original; despatch not
                            printed.]</note> discussed the use of the word “fascist” in connection
                        with Japan, Italy and Germany. The term has come to be used to describe that
                        which is the antonym of communist; therefore any state which is
                        anti-communist is immediately labelled “fascist”. If the present triangular
                        combination is analyzed, however, it becomes immediately apparent that not
                        only is the group not merely anti-communist but that its policies and
                        practices equally run counter to those of the so-called democratic powers.
                        Thus it can be seen that the question resolves itself into the simple fact
                        that it is a combination of those states which are bent upon upsetting the
                            <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> as opposed to those states which wish
                        to preserve the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, or, more simply, of the
                        “have-nots” against the “haves”, and that anti-communism is merely the
                        banner under which the “have-nots” are rallying.</p>
                    <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0227"/>
                    <p>The threat to England is very real and immediately apparent upon reflection
                        that with the addition of Japan to the Rome-Berlin axis the life-line of the
                        British Empire is threatened from the North Sea through the Mediterranean
                        and beyond Singapore.</p>
                    <p>It is of some interest to note that in completing this triangular
                        anti-communist pact Japan, instead of signing a separate agreement with
                        Italy, arranged to have Italy adhere to the already existing German-Japanese
                        pact in the expectation of avoiding giving unnecessary and further affront
                        to Moscow such as was given last November when Berlin and Tokyo announced
                        the anti-Comintern pact. This is an example of the greater delicacy with
                        which such matters are handled when arranged by the civil authorities and
                        through the proper channels as compared with the heavy-handedness of the
                        military who engineered the pact with Germany apparently without the
                        knowledge of the Foreign Office and timed it so badly that news of it leaked
                        out only a few days before the settlement of the very troublesome fisheries
                        question with Soviet Russia was to have taken place. Comment from Moscow on
                        Rome’s recent action is lacking here but if there has been any it was
                        undoubtedly directed largely against Italy. But it is easy to imagine the
                        nature of the comment directed against Japan if Japan had signed a separate
                        anti-Comintern agreement with Italy.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                    <p>73. Japan has entered into negotiations with Germany and Italy for a definite
                        alliance, both military and political. The questions under present
                        consideration concern the exact scope of the understanding; that is, whether
                        it is to be aimed only at Russia or against other nations also. The above is
                        based on reliable reports. Germany and Italy are said to be asking for the
                        broad application while Japan wishes to restrict the scope of the
                        alliance.</p>
                    <p>Apparently the Germans, and to a less extent the Italians, are seeking an
                        arrangement recognizing and giving effect to the superior strategic position
                        which they hold as compared with the Japanese should a conflict arise
                        between Russia and any member of the alliance. We are reliably informed that
                        the Germans and Italians consider Japan a natural ally because they feel
                        sure that Japan would seize <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0228"/>the
                        opportunity to attack Russia should that power become engaged in war with
                        either Germany or Italy or with both of them. That is why they do not wish
                        to make commitments to come to the aid of Japan if only Japan comes into
                        conflict with Russia.</p>
                    <p>Important moderate influences are in operation to keep the Japanese
                        Government from joining itself completely with the Rome-Berlin Axis.
                        However, strong pressure is being exerted on the other side; the younger
                        army officers are especially keen for this tie-up. It is thought that
                        Foreign Minister Arita favors making the alliance. It was he who sponsored
                        the anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
                    <p>I have acted through informal channels to convey to Arita the idea that Japan
                        would do well to consider, before taking an irrevocable step, what would be
                        the possible effects upon relations with the United States of such an
                        alliance. My British colleague feels that it would be useful for me to seek
                        an interview with Arita on this question but I am not convinced that a
                        direct approach is desirable. It is my belief that the best course would be
                        to limit myself, should future conversations with Arita bring up this
                        question naturally, to stressing the view that if her ultimate welfare is to
                        be served Japan must cultivate and maintain friendly relations with all
                        nations, and that friendly relations with the United States and Great
                        Britain are of especial value because Japan’s rapid development economically
                        and industrially would have been impossible without the liberal American and
                        British trade policies. It seems to me that the principal benefit to which
                        we can invite Arita’s attention as an offset to whatever the Japanese expect
                        to gain from an arrangement with the Axis is the value to Japan of British
                        and American markets. No matter what a government’s policy may be, a
                        government cannot necessarily control moral sanctions by the people.</p>
                    <p>The Department can determine better than I the advisability of approaching
                        the Foreign Minister directly on this matter and whether such an approach,
                        if made, should be under instructions or on my own responsibility.</p>

                    <p>33. With reference to your telegram No. 73 of February 8, 4 p.m., we leave to
                        your discretion the form and substance of any further approach on this
                        subject, but in our opinion whatever approach you make should be on your own
                        responsibility. We agree entirely with <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163"
                            facs="0229"/>you that it is desirable that Japan should not enter into
                        the proposed alliance. As regards your mention of the desirability of good
                        relations with all countries, especially the United States and Great
                        Britain, we suggest that you merely say with all countries, among which the
                        United States is important. If you think best, you might emphasize the
                        conviction that mutually beneficial and friendly relations among the nations
                        of the world and the general adoption of policies which will serve as a
                        basis for broadening rather than narrowing such relations will serve the
                        best interests of all nations, including Japan. Naturally you will take care
                        not to say anything implying that the United States might give any specific
                        compensation to Japan for giving up the idea of entering the proposed Axis
                        alliance.</p>

                        I have told the Foreign Minister my personal views as to the negotiations
                        now under way between Japan and the Axis Powers. This conversation with
                        Arita convinces me that the Japanese will fully consider all factors before
                        reaching whatever decision may be made. Talks with several newspaper men who
                        maintain close relations with Arita confirm this view.</p>
                    <p>I hear that Japan is still standing out for limiting the proposed alliance so
                        that it will be applied as against Russia only, but this information is not

                        Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported to have made the following
                        statement yesterday at a meeting of the Budget Committee of the Lower House:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The present pivot of Japanese foreign policy today is the relations
                                arising out of the Japanese-German-Italian anti-Comintern Pact <pb
                                    n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0230"/>which was established to
                                combat the destructive designs of the Comintern. The present
                                conflict with China derives from many causes but the most important
                                of these is the activity in China of the Comintern, a fact which is
                                generally admitted. Accordingly, to bring about an adjustment of the
                                China incident and to establish firmly the new order in China,
                                resistance to the destructive activities of the Comintern is for
                                Japan an extremely important matter. The anti-Comintern Pact was
                                made the pivot of present Japanese policy for this purpose. However,
                                the firm establishment of the new order in East Asia and making
                                secure Japan’s general international position is not being left only
                                to the anti-Comintern Pact. In another direction, such as relations
                                with Great Britain and the United States, there is need for bringing
                                about on the part of those countries an understanding of Japan’s
                                position and attitude. In Great Britain, the United States, and in
                                various other countries, there is a tendency to look upon present
                                relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy as an association of
                                totalitarian states opposed to the democracies. As pointed out on
                                various occasions by the Prime Minister as well as by myself, that
                                is an absolutely erroneous observation. The reasons for the
                                establishment between Japan and Germany and Italy of relations
                                opposed to communism are merely those which I have already
                                described. I think, therefore, that it is clear these relations
                                contain no implication of opposition to Great Britain, the United
                                States, and other democracies. I have briefly and only in the most
                                general terms outlined Japan’s foreign policy. I have also been
                                asked to explain conditions in various other countries but I doubt
                                the wisdom of complying with the request in this place. Perhaps an
                                opportunity will present itself in the near future for me to make a
                                further statement with regard to these matters.”</p>

                    <p>The Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy, considering it as the condition
                        precedent of any lasting peace that all nations of the world be given each
                        its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one
                        another in regard to their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of
                        Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and
                        maintain a new order of things calculated to promote mutual prosperity and
                        welfare of the peoples concerned. Furthermore it is the desire of the three
                        Governments to extend cooperation to such nations in other spheres of the
                        world as may be inclined to put forth endeavours along lines similar to
                        their own, in order that their ultimate aspirations for world peace may thus
                        be realized. Accordingly the Governments of Japan, Germany and Italy have
                        agreed as follows:</p>

                        attacked by a power at present not involved in the European War or in the

                    <p>910. Number 2. Translation radio address by Mr. Yosuke Matsuoka, Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs, September 27, 1940: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Today, on the occasion of the conclusion of the three-power pact
                                between Japan, Germany and Italy, an Imperial rescript—I am
                                profoundly moved to say—has been issued to the nation. What we His
                                Majesty’s subjects should do has been plainly indicated by the Prime
                                Minister in his message. I sincerely believe that it is incumbent
                                upon all of us to lay to heart the august will of our Sovereign and
                                put forth our best efforts in order to surmount the current
                                emergency.</p>
                            <p>Our country is now faced with a most difficult situation,
                                unparalleled in its history. What step we should take at this moment
                                is a grave problem upon which hangs the fate of our nation. The
                                Government, keenly conscious of the gravity of its responsibilities,
                                is seeing to it that nothing shall come amiss.</p>
                            <p>The objective of Japan’s foreign policy is no other than to dispose
                                of the China affair, to construct a sphere of common prosperity in
                                greater East Asia and to contribute thereby to the establishment of
                                true peace for the entire world. But when we look at the actual
                                international situation we find that this intention of Japan is not
                                yet fully understood. There are countries which have the mistaken
                                idea that peace means the mere maintenance of the old order, or
                                those which, while realizing the inevitability of change, are
                                reluctant to part with the old order. Moreover, there are countries
                                which attempt to obstruct, directly or indirectly, our construction
                                of a new order in greater East Asia, and even those who resort to
                                all sorts of stratagem in order to block the path of Japan’s advance
                                toward the <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0233"/>fulfillment of
                                her great historic mission—that of establishing world peace. The
                                Japanese Government has assiduously striven to remedy this
                                regrettable state of affairs. Nevertheless, I regret to say that the
                                situation has not only failed to improve, but it has even shown
                                signs of aggravation in certain quarters.</p>
                            <p>Circumstances have now brought Japan to the point where she can no
                                longer permit the international situation to drift as it will. At
                                this juncture there is only one course for Japan to take. That is to
                                say internally we should stand resolutely together—one hundred
                                million people as one—by establishing speedily the new state
                                structure for national defense; and externally, we should first
                                unite with Germany and Italy which have the same aspirations and
                                policy as ours and later with those powers who can cooperate with
                                us. We should thus go fearlessly forward to carry out our
                                conviction, calling at the same time upon those powers that obstruct
                                us to reconsider their attitude. In such manner, the Government
                                expects to achieve the ultimate aim of our Yamato race—namely, the
                                establishment of a new order in East Asia.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, we have conducted negotiations with the representatives
                                of Germany and Italy which have resulted in the conclusion of the
                                three-power pact, made public just a short while ago.</p>
                            <p>The establishment of this historic relationship of alliance between
                                the three countries is of course due to the wisdom of our gracious
                                Sovereign. At the same time it owes much to the judgment and
                                decision of the eminent leaders of Germany and Italy—Chancellor
                                Hitler and Premier Mussolini. Again, the Grerman Foreign Minister,
                                Mr. von Ribbentrop, has earnestly made efforts for German-Japanese
                                cooperation from the very day he assumed his present post, while the
                                Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, having been once stationed in
                                East Asia, and understanding fully Japan’s position in East Asia,
                                has ceaselessly labored for the promotion of Italo-Japanese
                                friendship. Needless to say, these two Foreign Ministers have played
                                important roles in the conclusion of the present pact.</p>
                            <p>The pact provides that Japan, Germany and Italy shall cooperate
                                freely with one another toward the construction of a new order,
                                respectively in greater East Asia and in the regions of Europe, in
                                which these powers are at present engaged. It also provides that if
                                any one of the contracting parties should be attacked by an outside
                                power, at present not involved in the European war or in the China
                                affair, the three contracting powers shall render mutual assistance
                                with all possible means, political, economic, and military.
                                Accordingly, it does not mean that because of this pact Japan is to
                                enter the European war at present, nor that she intends to challenge
                                any power without provocation. It may be added also that the present
                                treaty will not affect in any way the existing political status
                                between Japan, Germany and Italy on the one hand and Soviet Russia
                                on the other.</p>
                            <p>The Treaty also provides that Germany and Italy recognize Japan’s
                                position of leadership in regard to the construction of a new order
                                in greater East Asia. We in turn recognize the leadership of Germany
                                and Italy in the European regions where they are now engaged in the
                                establishment of a new order, staking even their national existence
                                in the undertaking. And thus the three powers are to join forces and
                                help one another to the utmost.</p>
                            <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0234"/>
                            <p>With the conclusion of this treaty, Japan’s responsibilities as
                                leader of the new order in greater East Asia becomes even greater
                                than before. Although it is the intention of the Japanese Government
                                to fulfill these responsibilities always by peaceful means, there is
                                no telling whether there might not arise occasions and circumstances
                                calling for a momentous decision on the part of our nation. Our
                                future is beset with countless obstacles and difficulties which, it
                                must be fully realized, no ordinary effort will be sufficient to
                                surmount. Our Government and people, united as one and grasping
                                fully the situation both at home and abroad, should be prepared to
                                endure all hardships and sacrifices, and redouble their efforts so
                                as to conform to the august will of our Sovereign.”</p>

                            <p>“To enhance justice on earth and make of the world one household is
                                the great injunction, bequeathed by our [Imperial] Ancestors and
                                which we lay to heart day and night. In the stupendous crisis now
                                confronting the world, it appears that endless will be the
                                aggravation of war and confusion, and incalculable the disasters to
                                be inflicted upon mankind. We fervently hope that the cessation of
                                the disturbances and the restoration of peace will be realized as
                                swiftly as possible.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, we commanded our Government to deliberate on the matter
                                of mutual assistance and cooperation with the Governments of Germany
                                and Italy which share in the views and aspirations of our empire. We
                                are deeply gratified that a pact has been concluded between these
                                three powers.</p>
                            <p>The task of enabling each nation to find its proper place and all
                                individuals to live in peace and security is indeed one of great
                                magnitude, unparalleled in history. The goal lies still far distant.
                                Ye, our subjects, clarify evermore the concept of national polity;
                                think deeply and look far; unite in heart and strength, and surmount
                                the present emergency, to assist thereby in the promotion of the
                                Imperial fortune coeval [with] heaven and earth. September

                                Japan, Germany and Italy, an Imperial rescript has been issued,
                                setting forth clearly the aims of our empire and pointing the path
                                    <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0235"/>our nation should
                                follow. I am greatly moved by the boundless benevolence of our
                                Sovereign.</p>
                            <p>To maintain world peace and to insure the stability of East Asia is
                                indeed the immutable national policy of Japan, firmly rooted in the
                                principle on which our empire was founded.</p>
                            <p>With war breaking out in Europe last autumn, conflict and confusion
                                have spread increasingly over the world. It is an urgent necessity
                                of this moment to devise a measure for the cessation of the
                                disturbances and the restoration of peace. Germany and Italy share
                                with our empire in the same ideal and aspirations. Accordingly, with
                                a view to joining hands with these powers to establish a new order
                                in the respective regions, and furthermore to cooperating with them
                                toward the restoration of world peace, Japan has now concluded a
                                three-power pact. The time has come for our nation to proceed with
                                fresh resolve to construct a new order in greater East Asia.</p>
                            <p>However, to carry out fully the conviction of our country and to
                                enable all nations to find each its proper place is indeed a
                                difficult task. The goal lies far. We must expect to encounter
                                numerous obstacles as we go on.</p>
                            <p>I confidently hope that, in obedience to the Imperial will, our
                                people, in order to surmount the present emergency, will make clear
                                the concept of our national polity; unite heart and soul, and
                                overcome any and every obstacle—and thereby set at ease the august
                                mind of our Sovereign.”</p>

                    <p>916. The signing of the Japanese-German-Italian alliance is obviously a
                        tremendous Japanese gamble on the defeat of Britain by Germany. <pb n="170"
                            xml:id="pg_170" facs="0236"/>In an off-the-record talk with the Japanese
                        Foreign Minister, Mr. Grew informally expressed his opinion that Japan by
                        tying herself to the Reich would become merely a satellite of Germany,
                        however the war in Europe turned out. Mr. Grew said that in his opinion the
                        present Japanese course must throw Japan on the rocks; that Germany is not
                        and will not be in any position really to support Japan, no matter what
                        intentions along that line Germany may have expressed. Japan, by tying
                        herself to an economic bloc in East Asia which is economically unsound and
                        sacrificing the flow of free commerce with the world, is putting her
                        financial and economic future in a hopeless position. Matsuoka commented
                        only that these things were matters of opinion. Mr. Grew has heard but is
                        without confirmation that an outright alliance was opposed by the Foreign
                        Minister himself.</p>
                    <p>Although the alliance with the Axis has of course been a potentiality from
                        the inception of the present government<note n="8a" xml:id="d105fn8a">Headed
                            by Prince Konoye as Prime Minister, July 22, 1940.</note> and its trend
                        of policy, few observers expected it to materialize so rapidly. There was of
                        course considerable speculation prompted by the secretiveness of all the
                        proceedings. However, right up to the last moment some members of the
                        diplomatic corps failed to believe that the pact had actually evolved. Two
                        hours before the pact was to be signed in Berlin a usually well-informed
                        American newspaper correspondent in Tokyo was completely unaware of the
                        development. Stahmer<note n="8b" xml:id="d105fn8b">Head of the German
                            Economic Mission in Japan.</note> is believed to have been responsible
                        for actual negotiations in Japan.</p>
                    <p>The value of the alliance to the European side of the Axis is obvious, but
                        the value of it to Japan is certainly less clear. Obviously the primary aim
                        of the pact is the United States, and the German-Italian hope is naturally
                        that the pact will increase American fears of developments in the Pacific.
                        The proportionate gain to Japan seems to be much less. There may of course
                        be secret provisions to the treaty. Such provisions might be: (1) The
                        agreement of the U. S. S. R. to an arrangement freeing Japan of anxiety on
                        the Russian front, (2) intervention by Germany looking to mediation between
                        China and Japan, (3) Axis support for Japan in the Dutch East Indies and
                        Indochina. With regard to the first point, although there is wide talk of
                        the conclusion of a U. S. S. R.-Japan nonaggression agreement there is no
                        real information available as to Russia’s stand. The Ambassador of the U. S.
                        S. R. told a member of the diplomatic corps in Tokyo on September 28 that he
                        had not had any knowledge before the alliance of its terms. With regard to
                        German mediation in the China conflict, it is not seen that that is
                        possible, barring Soviet pressure on the Chiang Kai-shek government. In
                        Indochina the German-controlled government at Vichy is probably <pb n="171"
                            xml:id="pg_171" facs="0237"/>able to guarantee Japan’s freedom to carry
                        out her plans in Indochina. What is possibly one of the most dangerous
                        potential consequences of the alliance is a possible ruthless application of
                        power by Germany in Holland to bring about changes in the situation in the
                        Dutch East Indies.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday Mr. Grew was told in confidence by an officer of the Gaimusho who
                        is sympathetic to the United States and Britain that if the British were to
                        make a public offer of the use of the Singapore base to America, or if an
                        American squadron were to visit Singapore, this would be the most effective
                        possible counter to the alliance, and, the official believed, would give
                        pause to the extremists in Japan.</p>

                    <p>929. Some members of the Diplomatic Corps in Tokyo, in informal conversations
                        with Mr. Ohashi, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon asking what
                        advantage Japan expected to gain from the pact, have been told that it was
                        specifically directed against the United States. Mr. Ohashi has told these
                        persons that ever since 1924, the date on which Japanese exclusion was

                        world order and that world totalitarianism would effectively wipe out the
                        nearly bankrupt Anglo-Saxon democracies.</p>

                        historical and philosophical nature but outstanding points will be reported

                        concerning the three-power alliance” of which our translation follows.
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“A statement to the United States concerning the three-power
                                alliance.</p>
                            <p>The recent three-power alliance is not aimed at any particular
                                country. If Japan, Germany and Italy unite, the probability of being
                                attacked by another country is decreased, the spreading of world
                                disorder may be prevented, and in this sense the alliance
                                contributes to world peace. By this treaty Japan has further
                                clarified its intention to establish a new order in greater East
                                Asia including the South Seas.</p>
                            <p>The construction of a new order in East Asia means the construction
                                of a new order under which Japan establishes the relationship of
                                common existence and mutual prosperity with the peoples of each and
                                every land in greater East Asia, that is East Asia including the
                                South Seas. In a position of equality with every other country,
                                Japan may freely carry on enterprises, trade and emigration in and
                                to each and every land in greater East Asia and thereby be enabled
                                to solve its population problem. This does not mean these areas are
                                to be exploited and conquered, nor does it mean these areas are to
                                be closed to the trade and enterprises of other countries. Japan has
                                long tried to solve its population problem through emigration, trade
                                and enterprises abroad, but the various countries of Europe and
                                America have nullified Japan’s reasonable and peaceful efforts
                                concerning its population problem since those countries have turned
                                back Japanese immigrants to their great territories and have
                                obstructed trade and enterprise.</p>
                            <p>In the greater East Asia sphere of mutual prosperity, the endeavor is
                                being made to abolish such unnatural restrictions on the free
                                activities of mankind. It is expected that this endeavor will be
                                accomplished insofar as possible through peaceful means and with the
                                least possible undesirable change in the <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Japan’s policy toward China forms an important part of the above
                                endeavor. However, owing to the lack of understanding on the part of
                                some Chinese people and to the attitude taken by England and the
                                United States in not recognizing Manchukuo, which gave rise to
                                Chiang Kai-shek’s hope of recovering Manchukuo, an unfortunate clash
                                of arms broke out. This clash is, in fact, war and therefore it is
                                impossible for the Japanese Army during its activities to avoid
                                affecting rights and interests of the powers in China. This is
                                particularly true when such rights and interests hinder the
                                prosecution of Japan’s war against China. Accordingly, if the
                                effects upon these rights and interests are to be brought to an end,
                                it is most desirable to encourage and promote peace between Japan
                                and China. This fact notwithstanding the powers are not only
                                checking Japan’s actions through legalistic arguments and treaty
                                pronouncements which have become inapplicable because of changing
                                conditions, but are also oppressing Japan through such means as
                                restriction on the exportation of important commodities to Japan and
                                at the same time are giving positive aid to Japan’s enemy, the
                                Chiang Kai-shek regime. These actions spring from hidden motives to
                                keep the Orient under conditions <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                                    facs="0239"/>of disorder as long as possible and to consume
                                Japan’s national strength. We must believe that these actions are
                                not for the love of peace and are not for the purpose of protecting
                                rights and interests. Japan concluded a defensive alliance with
                                Germany and Italy for no other purpose than to resist such pressure
                                from the powers, and there is not the slightest intention to proceed
                                to attack another country. If the United States understands the
                                aforementioned conditions and circumstances and Japan’s intentions
                                with regard to the establishment of a new order in East Asia, there
                                will be no change whatever in the relationship between Japan and the
                                United States following the conclusion of this treaty. Japan is
                                determined to settle all pending question; 5 and to promote and
                                foster friendship with the United States.”</p>

                    <p>This is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk on national security;
                        because the nub of the whole purpose of your President is to keep you now,
                        and your children later, and your grandchildren much later, out of a
                        last-ditch war for the preservation of American independence and all of the
                        things that American independence means to you and to me and to ours.</p>
                    <p>Tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back eight years ago
                        to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis. It was a time when the wheels
                        of American industry were grinding to a full stop, when the whole banking
                        system of our country had ceased to function.</p>
                    <p>I well remember that while I sat in my study in the White House, preparing to
                        talk with the people of the United States, I had before <pb n="174"
                            xml:id="pg_174" facs="0240"/>my eyes the picture of all those Americans
                        with whom I was talking. I saw the workmen in the mills, the mines, the
                        factories; the girl behind the counter; the small shopkeeper; the farmer
                        doing his spring plowing; the widows and the old men wondering about their
                        life’s savings.</p>
                    <p>I tried to convey to the great mass of American people what the banking
                        crisis meant to them in their daily lives.</p>
                    <p>Tonight, I want to do the same thing, with the same people, in this new
                        crisis which faces America.</p>
                    <p>We met the issue of 1933 with courage and realism.</p>
                    <p>We face this new crisis—this new threat to the security of our Nation—with
                        the same courage and realism.</p>
                    <p>Never before since Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization
                        been in such danger as now.</p>
                    <p>For, on September 27, 1940, by an agreement signed in Berlin, three powerful
                        nations, two in Europe and one in Asia, joined themselves together in the
                        threat that if the United States interfered with or blocked the expansion
                        program of these three nations—a program aimed at world control—they would
                        unite in ultimate action against the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Nazi masters of Germany have made it clear that they intend not only to
                        dominate all life and thought in their own country, but also to enslave the
                        whole of Europe, and then to use the resources of Europe to dominate the
                        rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>Three weeks ago their leader stated, “There are two worlds that stand opposed
                        to each other.” Then in defiant reply to his opponents, he said this:
                        “Others are correct when they say: ‘With this world we cannot ever reconcile
                        ourselves.’ … I can beat any other power in the world.” So said the leader
                        of the Nazis.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the Axis not merely admits but proclaims that there can be no
                        ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and our philosophy of
                        government.</p>
                    <p>In view of the nature of this undeniable threat, it can be asserted, properly
                        and categorically, that the United States has no right or reason to
                        encourage talk of peace until the day shall come when there is a clear
                        intention on the part of the aggressor nations to abandon all thought of
                        dominating or conquering the world.</p>
                    <p>At this moment, the forces of the states that are leagued against all peoples
                        who live in freedom are being held away from our shores. The Germans and
                        Italians are being blocked on the other side of the Atlantic by the British,
                        and by the Greeks, and by thousands of soldiers and sailors who were able to
                        escape from subjugated countries. The Japanese are being engaged in Asia by
                        the Chinese in another great defense.</p>
                    <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0241"/>
                    <p>In the Pacific is our fleet.</p>
                    <p>Some of our people like to believe that wars in Europe and in Asia are of no
                        concern to us. But it is a matter of most vital concern to us that European
                        and Asiatic war-makers should not gain control of the oceans which lead to
                        this hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>One hundred and seventeen years ago the Monroe Doctrine was conceived by our
                        Government as a measure of defense in the face of a threat against this
                        hemisphere by an alliance in continental Europe. Thereafter, we stood on
                        guard in the Atlantic, with the British as neighbors. There was no treaty.
                        There was no “unwritten agreement”.</p>
                    <p>Yet, there was the feeling, proven correct by history, that we as neighbors
                        could settle any disputes in peaceful fashion. The fact is that during the
                        whole of this time the Western Hemisphere has remained free from aggression
                        from Europe or from Asia.</p>
                    <p>Does anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack while a free
                        Britain remains our most peaceful naval neighbor in the Atlantic? Does
                        anyone seriously believe, on the other hand, that we could rest easy if the
                        Axis powers were our neighbors there?</p>
                    <p>If Great Britain goes down, the Axis powers will control the continents of
                        Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas—and they will be in a
                        position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this
                        hemisphere. It is no exaggeration to say that all of us in the Americas
                        would be living at the point of a gun—a gun loaded with explosive bullets,
                        economic as well as military.</p>
                    <p>We should enter upon a new and terrible era in which the whole world, our
                        hemisphere included, would be run by threats of brute force. To survive in
                        such a world, we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a
                        militaristic power on the basis of war economy.</p>
                    <p>Some of us like to believe that even if Great Britain falls, we are still
                        safe, because of the broad expanse of the Atlantic and of the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>But the width of these oceans is not what it was in the days of clipper
                        ships. At one point between Africa and Brazil the distance is less than from
                        Washington to Denver—five hours for the latest type of bomber. And at the
                        north of the Pacific Ocean, America and Asia almost touch each other.</p>
                    <p>Even today we have planes which could fly from the British Isles to New
                        England and back without refueling. And the range of the modern bomber is
                        ever being increased.</p>
                    <p>During the past week many people in all parts of the Nation have told me what
                        they wanted me to say tonight. Almost all of them expressed a courageous
                        desire to hear the plain truth about <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0242"
                        />the gravity of the situation. One telegram, however, expressed the
                        attitude of the small minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil,
                        even though they know in their hearts that evil exists. That telegram begged
                        me not to tell again of the ease with which our American cities could be
                        bombed by any hostile power which had gained bases in this Western
                        Hemisphere. The gist of that telegram was: “Please, Mr. President, don’t
                        frighten us by telling us the facts.”</p>
                    <p>Frankly and definitely there is danger ahead—danger against which we must
                        prepare. But we well know that we cannot escape danger, or the fear of it,
                        by crawling into bed and pulling the covers over our heads.</p>
                    <p>Some nations of Europe were bound by solemn non-intervention pacts with
                        Germany. Other nations were assured by Germany that they need never fear
                        invasion. Non-intervention pact or not, the fact remains that they were
                        attacked, overrun, and thrown into the modern form of slavery at an hour’s
                        notice or even without any notice at all. As an exiled leader of one of
                        these nations said to me the other day: “The notice was a minus quantity. It
                        was given to my government two hours after German troops had poured into my
                        country in a hundred places.”</p>
                    <p>The fate of these nations tells us what it means to live at the point of a
                        Nazi gun.</p>
                    <p>The Nazis have justified such actions by various pious frauds. One of these
                        frauds is the claim that they are occupying a nation for the purpose of
                        “restoring order”. Another is that they are occupying or controlling a
                        nation on the excuse that they are “protecting it” against the aggression of
                        somebody else.</p>
                    <p>For example, Germany has said that she was occupying Belgium to save the
                        Belgians from the British. Would she hesitate to say to any South American
                        country, “We are occupying you to protect you from aggression by the United
                        States”?</p>
                    <p>Belgium today is being used as an invasion base against Britain, now fighting
                        for its life. Any South American country, in Nazi hands, would always
                        constitute a jumping-off place for German attack on any one of the other
                        republics of this hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>Analyze for yourselves the future of two other places even nearer to Germany
                        if the Nazis won. Could Ireland hold out? Would Irish freedom be permitted
                        as an amazing exception in an unfree world? Or the islands of the Azores
                        which still fly the flag of Portugal after five centuries? We think of
                        Hawaii as an outpost of defense in the Pacific. Yet, the Azores are closer
                        to our shores in the Atlantic than Hawaii is on the other side.</p>
                    <p>There are those who say that the Axis powers would never have any desire to
                        attack the Western Hemisphere. This is the same dangerous <pb n="177"
                            xml:id="pg_177" facs="0243"/>form of wishful thinking which has
                        destroyed the powers of resistance of so many conquered peoples. The plain
                        facts are that the Nazis have proclaimed, time and again, that all other
                        races are their inferiors and therefore subject to their orders. And most
                        important of all, the vast resources and wealth of this hemisphere
                        constitute the most tempting loot in all the world.</p>
                    <p>Let us no longer blind ourselves to the undeniable fact that the evil forces
                        which have crushed and undermined and corrupted so many others are already
                        within our own gates. Your Government knows much about them and every day is
                        ferreting them out.</p>
                    <p>Their secret emissaries are active in our own and neighboring countries. They
                        seek to stir up suspicion and dissension to cause internal strife. They try
                        to turn capital against labor and vice versa. They try to reawaken long
                        slumbering racial and religious enmities which should have no place in this
                        country. They are active in every group that promotes intolerance. They
                        exploit for their own ends our natural abhorrence of war. These
                        trouble-breeders have but one purpose. It is to divide our people into
                        hostile groups and to destroy our unity and shatter our will to defend
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>There are also American citizens, many of them in high places, who,
                        unwittingly in most cases, are aiding and abetting the work of these agents.
                        I do not charge these American citizens with being foreign agents. But I do
                        charge them with doing exactly the kind of work that the dictators want done
                        in the United States.</p>
                    <p>These people not only believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our
                        eyes to the fate of other nations. Some of them go much further than that.
                        They say that we can and should become the friends and even the partners of
                        the Axis powers. Some of them even suggest that we should imitate the
                        methods of the dictatorships. Americans never can and never will do
                        that.</p>
                    <p>The experience of the past two years has proven beyond doubt that no nation
                        can appease the Nazis. No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it.
                        There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning
                        with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the
                        Nazis only at the price of total surrender.</p>
                    <p>Even the people of Italy have been forced to become accomplices of the Nazis;
                        but at this moment they do not know how soon they will be embraced to death
                        by their allies.</p>
                    <p>The American appeasers ignore the warning to be found in the fate of Austria,
                        Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and
                        France. They tell you that the Axis powers are going to win anyway; that all
                        this bloodshed in the world could be saved; and that the United States might
                        just as well throw its <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0244"/>influence
                        into the scale of a dictated peace, and get the best out of it that we
                        can.</p>
                    <p>They call it a “negotiated peace”. Nonsense! Is it a negotiated peace if a
                        gang of outlaws surrounds your community and on threat of extermination
                        makes you pay tribute to save your own skins?</p>
                    <p>Such a dictated peace would be no peace at all. It would be only another
                        armistice, leading to the most gigantic armament race and the most
                        devastating trade wars in history. And in these contests the Americas would
                        offer the only real resistance to the Axis powers.</p>
                    <p>With all their vaunted efficiency and parade of pious purpose in this war,
                        there are still in their background the concentration camp and the servants
                        of God in chains.</p>
                    <p>The history of recent years proves that shootings and chains and
                        concentration camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altars
                        of modern dictatorships. They may talk of a “new order” in the world, but
                        what they have in mind is but a revival of the oldest and the worst tyranny.
                        In that there is no liberty, no religion, no hope.</p>
                    <p>The proposed “new order” is the very opposite of a United States of Europe or
                        a United States of Asia. It is not a government based upon the consent of
                        the governed. It is not a union of ordinary, self-respecting men and women
                        to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from oppression.
                        It is an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and enslave the human
                        race.</p>
                    <p>The British people are conducting an active war against this unholy alliance.
                        Our own future security is greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight.
                        Our ability to “keep out of war” is going to be affected by that
                        outcome.</p>
                    <p>Thinking in terms of today and tomorrow, I make the direct statement to the
                        American people that there is far less chance of the United States getting
                        into war if we do all we can now to support the nations defending themselves
                        against attack by the Axis than if we acquiesce in their defeat, submit
                        tamely to an Axis victory, and wait our turn to be the object of attack in
                        another war later on.</p>
                    <p>If we are to be completely honest with ourselves, we must admit there is risk
                        in any course we may take. But I deeply believe that the great majority of
                        our people agree that the course that I advocate involves the least risk now
                        and the greatest hope for world peace in the future.</p>
                    <p>The people of Europe who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their
                        fighting. They ask us for the implements of war, the planes, the tanks, the
                        guns, the freighters, which will enable them to fight for their liberty and
                        our security. Emphatically we must get these weapons to them in sufficient
                        volume and quickly enough, so <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0245"/>that
                        we and our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which
                        others have had to endure.</p>
                    <p>Let not defeatists tell us that it is too late. It will never be earlier.
                        Tomorrow will be later than today.</p>
                    <p>Certain facts are self-evident.</p>
                    <p>In a military sense Great Britain and the British Empire are today the
                        spearhead of resistance to world conquest. They are putting up a fight which
                        will live forever in the story of human gallantry.</p>
                    <p>There is no demand for sending an American Expeditionary Force outside our
                        own borders. There is no intention by any member of your Government to send
                        such a force. You can, therefore, nail any talk about sending armies to
                        Europe as a deliberate untruth.</p>
                    <p>Our national policy is not directed toward war. Its sole purpose is to keep
                        war away from our country and our people.</p>
                    <p>Democracy’s fight against world conquest is being greatly aided, and must be
                        more greatly aided, by the rearmament of the United States and by sending
                        every ounce and every ton of munitions and supplies that we can possibly
                        spare to help the defenders who are in the front lines. It is no more
                        unneutral for us to do that than it is for Sweden, Russia, and other nations
                        near Germany to send steel and ore and oil and other war materials into
                        Germany every day.</p>
                    <p>We are planning our own defense with the utmost urgency; and in its vast
                        scale we must integrate the war needs of Britain and the other free nations
                        resisting aggression.</p>
                    <p>This is not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion. It is
                        a matter of realistic military policy, based on the advice of our military
                        experts who are in close touch with existing warfare. These military and
                        naval experts and the members of the Congress and the administration have a
                        single-minded purpose—the defense of the United States.</p>
                    <p>This Nation is making a great effort to produce everything that is necessary
                        in this emergency—and with all possible speed. This great effort requires
                        great sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>I would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend
                        everyone in the Nation against want and privation. The strength of this
                        Nation shall not be diluted by the failure of the Government to protect the
                        economic well-being of all citizens.</p>
                    <p>If our capacity to produce is limited by machines, it must ever be remembered
                        that these machines are operated by the skill and the stamina of the
                        workers. As the Government is determined to protect the rights of workers,
                        so the Nation has a right to expect that the men who man the machines will
                        discharge their full responsibilities to the urgent needs of defense.</p>
                    <p>The worker possesses the same human dignity and is entitled to the same
                        security of position as the engineer or manager or owner. <pb n="180"
                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0246"/>For the workers provide the human power
                        that turns out the destroyers, the airplanes, and the tanks.</p>
                    <p>The Nation expects our defense industries to continue operation without
                        interruption by strikes or lock-outs. It expects and insists that management
                        and workers will reconcile their differences by voluntary or legal means, to
                        continue to produce the supplies that are so sorely needed.</p>
                    <p>And on the economic side of our great defense program, we are, as you know,
                        bending every effort to maintain stability of prices and with that the
                        stability of the cost of living.</p>
                    <p>Nine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organization to
                        direct our gigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions. The
                        appropriation of vast sums of money and a well-coordinated executive
                        direction of our defense efforts are not in themselves enough. Guns, planes,
                        and ships have to be built in the factories and arsenals of America. They
                        have to be produced by workers and managers and engineers with the aid of
                        machines, which in turn have to be built by hundreds of thousands of workers
                        throughout the land.</p>
                    <p>In this great work there has been splendid cooperation between the Government
                        and industry and labor.</p>
                    <p>American industrial genius, unmatched throughout the world in the solution of
                        production problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and talents
                        into action. Manufacturers of watches, of farm implements, linotypes, cash
                        registers, automobiles, sewing machines, lawn mowers, and locomotives are
                        now making fuses, bomb-packing crates, telescope mounts, shells, pistols,
                        and tanks.</p>
                    <p>But all our present efforts are not enough. We must have more ships, more
                        guns, more planes—more of everything. This can only be accomplished if we
                        discard the notion of “business as usual”. This job cannot be done merely by
                        superimposing on the existing productive facilities the added requirements
                        for defense.</p>
                    <p>Our defense efforts must not be blocked by those who fear the future
                        consequences of surplus plant capacity. The possible consequences of failure
                        of our defense efforts now are much more to be feared.</p>
                    <p>After the present needs of our defense are past, a proper handling of the
                        country’s peacetime needs will require all of the new productive capacity—if
                        not more.</p>
                    <p>No pessimistic policy about the future of America shall delay the immediate
                        expansion of those industries essential to defense.</p>
                    <p>I want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the Nation to build now
                        with all possible speed every machine and arsenal and factory that we need
                        to manufacture our defense material. We have the men, the skill, the wealth,
                        and above all, the will.</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0247"/>
                    <p>I am confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury goods in
                        certain industries requires the use of machines and raw materials essential
                        for defense purposes, then such production must yield to our primary and
                        compelling purpose.</p>
                    <p>I appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our own
                        Government employees, to put every ounce of effort into producing these
                        munitions swiftly and without stint. And with this appeal I give you the
                        pledge that all of us who are officers of your Government will devote
                        ourselves to the same whole-hearted extent to the great task which lies
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>As planes and ships and guns and shells are produced, your Government, with
                        its defense experts, can then determine how best to use them to defend this
                        hemisphere. The decision as to how much shall be sent abroad and how much
                        shall remain at home must be made on the basis of our over-all military
                        necessities.</p>
                    <p>We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as
                        serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same
                        resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and
                        sacrifice, as we would show were we at war.</p>
                    <p>We have furnished the British great material support and we will furnish far
                        more in the future.</p>
                    <p>There will be no “bottlenecks” in our determination to aid Great Britain. No
                        dictator, no combination of dictators, will weaken that determination by
                        threats of how they will construe that determination.</p>
                    <p>The British have received invaluable military support from the heroic Greek
                        Army and from the forces of all the governments in exile. Their strength is
                        growing. It is the strength of men and women who value their freedom more
                        highly than they value their lives.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the Axis powers are not going to win this war. I base that
                        belief on the latest and best information.</p>
                    <p>We have no excuse for defeatism. We have every good reason for hope—hope for
                        peace, hope for the defense of our civilization and for the building of a
                        better civilization in the future.</p>
                    <p>I have the profound conviction that the American people are now determined to
                        put forth a mightier effort than they have ever yet made to increase our
                        production of all the implements of defense, to meet the threat to our
                        democratic faith.</p>
                    <p>As President of the United States I call for that national effort. I call for
                        it in the name of this Nation which we love and honor and which we are
                        privileged and proud to serve. I call upon our people with absolute
                        confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed.</p>

                    <p>200. Department has received following information from the Embassy in
                        Germany with regard to Matsuoka’s visit to Berlin:</p>
                    <p>The German Government hopes that, as result of visit of Japanese Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs, Japan will be completely bound to the Axis. An impressive
                        display is to be made in order to convince the Minister of the irresistible
                        force of Germany’s military machine and of the absolute assurance of victory
                        over Britain. Germany may also have new military or political successes in
                        Greece or Yugoslavia to show him. Not very long ago a prominent German
                        stated privately that although the Government was highly desirous of
                        obtaining Japan’s adherence to Axis, it feared lest advantage might be taken
                        of the alliance by the Japanese to attempt movement of some extreme sort
                        against Britain in the Pacific and get the United States into the war. The
                        same man said that the Axis wants Japan to play the part of a threat which
                        would prevent the United States from giving aid to the British, including
                        all-out naval assistance, but which would stop short of any action that
                        would bring the United States into the war.</p>
                    <p>If foregoing information is correct, the appearances are that German efforts
                        will be directed toward convincing Japanese Minister that Britain will soon
                        be decisively defeated or disabled and that then Germany will give effective
                        support, either in political or military way, if necessary, to Japan’s
                        claims. Matsuoka will certainly discuss Soviet Union’s attitude toward
                        Japan. Our Chargé in Germany has not directly heard any speculation in
                        Berlin, however, as to whether German Government is ready to bring pressure
                        to bear on the Soviets to bring the Russians to abandon or modify their
                        anti-Japanese policies, nor has he personally heard it speculated that
                        Germany will be asked to bring the said pressure. The Foreign Office had
                        hoped that arrival of the Japanese Minister in Berlin would take place
                        before passage of our Lend-Lease Bill,<note n="11" xml:id="d110fn11">H. R.
                            1776, approved March 11, 1941; 55 Stat. 31.</note> and that a
                        declaration might be made likely to affect the measures taken under that
                        act. It seems highly probable that the Germans are apprehensive that new
                        measures may be taken in the United States or continued statements may be
                        made either in the United States or in Britain before Matsuoka arrives that
                        may deter him and Japanese Government from allying Japan more closely with
                        Axis. The Foreign Minister’s absence from Japan is taken generally to be
                        silent <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0249"/>assurance that Japanese
                        Government will not undertake any provocative action while he is away. His
                        visit to Rome besides being one of courtesy is also to enable him to gain
                        personal impression of Italian people’s morale and of Italy’s military
                        strength. Observers in Germany have also in mind the possibility that in
                        view of the resolute attitude of the United States toward aggression by
                        totalitarian powers the Japanese Foreign Minister may be designing to evolve
                        a formula for extricating Japan from the folly of its adherence to the
                        Tripartite Pact.</p>

                    <p>201. The Department has been informed by the American Ambassador in the U. S.
                        S. R. that when Matsuoka was in Moscow the chiefs of the German and Italian
                        diplomatic missions there as well as those of the powers associated with the
                        Axis were received by him on March 24. The substance of his remarks to them
                        is as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Japan was with the Axis one hundred per cent.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>He was going to Rome and Berlin in order to confer with Japan’s
                                allies, for no nation acted by itself under conditions as they
                                exist, each nation acts as part of a bloc; and on his return trip
                                here the character of his visit would rest wholly upon the result
                                which his talks in Rome and Berlin would have. The Minister then
                                stated categorically that he did not intend to go anywhere except to
                                Rome and Berlin. (This statement is an interesting contrast to the
                                one he made to the American Ambassador that it was his desire and
                                intention to visit several of the occupied capitals and
                                Vichy.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Japan had entered into the tripartite pact because of her desire
                                for peace, not for the making of war, and specifically because Japan
                                wished to prevent the entry of the United States into the war.
                                Matsuoka said he was convinced that the United States would not join
                                the war, but in the contrary event, Japan would come in likewise on
                                the side of her allies.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Matsuoka stated that he was informed that production in the United
                                States could not be substantially increased before June of this year
                                and that the United States would not be in a position to render
                                Britain effective help before the end of the year. By that time
                                Britain will have been defeated, though an empire the size of
                                Britain could not, of course, collapse in a couple of days.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>After Britain’s collapse there would be no continuation of the
                                struggle by the United States, but that country would withdraw and
                                would give its attention to its own affairs and interests. The
                                Minister said that it was chimerical to talk about the war’s being
                                continued by the United States with the aid of the British Fleet. He

                    <p>When Matsuoka had finished speaking he was asked by the Bulgarian Minister
                        for an expression of his views on the Balkan situation. The Japanese
                        Minister replied that it was his belief that Greece would be persuaded by
                        Italy and Germany to conclude peace for the reason that Yugoslavia is now
                        becoming a member of the tripartite, and that he was unable to think that
                        Greece would continue to wage a hopeless contest with Italy and Germany.
                        Greece could not expect to receive sufficient effective help from Great
                        Britain, in his opinion, to make it possible for Greece to continue to
                        resist, and added, also as his opinion, that the Greeks would think of their
                        own best interests as they were intelligent. He also said that then peace
                        would be assured in the Balkans—as Turkey would be unable to do
                        anything—once Greece had made peace.</p>
                    <p>The Rumanian Minister made the observation on this point that everything, it
                        seemed to him, hinged upon how Greece would play her cards, and on the
                        conditions of peace which might be offered by Germany. Matsuoka answered
                        that he could state definitely and of his own knowledge that Germany had no
                        desire to force the issue and would do the utmost to convince the Greeks by
                        diplomatic means that to make peace was in their own interest.</p>

                            the present time there was no possibility for peace and that several
                            times Hitler had said to him emphatically that unless Britain

                            direct negotiation between them; an intermediary would not be accepted

                    <p>551. The following statement by Prime Minister Konoye was issued by the Board
                        of Information last night: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Japanese Government some time ago made public both at home and
                                abroad their unalterable determination, by concluding the tripartite
                                pact among Japan, Germany and Italy to prevent a worldwide spread of
                                war and to “secure the peace of greater East Asia with that pact as
                                the axis of the country’s foreign policy. It goes without saying
                                that, in order to realize such a purpose, it is essential that Japan
                                and the Soviet Union, which are neighbors in the Far East, should
                                strengthen their peaceful and friendly relation on a lasting basis,
                                reinforcing thereby the spirit of the said pact of alliance. With
                                this conviction, the Government has for some time been conducting
                                negotiations with the Soviet Government with a view to bringing
                                about a fundamental adjustment of Japan’s relation with the Soviet
                                Union. With the present visit to Moscow of the Foreign Minister, Mr.
                                Yosuke Matsuoka, as a turning point, the conversations between the
                                two Governments have made rapid progress, resulting in the signature
                                today, April 13, of the pact of neutrality between the Foreign
                                Minister, Mr. Yosuke Matsuoka, and Ambassador Lieutenant General
                                Yoshitsugu Tatekawa, and the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs,
                                Mr. Vyacheslav Molotov, which has just been announced. At the same
                                time the joint declaration by the two countries has been issued
                                through which Japan respects the territorial integrity and
                                inviolability of the People’s Republic of Mongolia and the Soviet
                                Union respects the territorial integrity and inviolability of
                                Manchukuo, thereby expecting to bring tranquility to the
                                Manchukuo-Soviet and Manchukuo-Outer Mongolian borders.</p>
                            <p>It is my belief that the present pact has an epoch-making
                                significance in the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and
                                that it will greatly contribute toward the promotion of world peace.
                                I have no doubt that the pact will serve as a basis for rapid
                                solution in a concrete manner of various pending questions between
                                the two countries.”</p>

                    <p>In reply to inquiries at his press conference today, the Secretary of State
                        made the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The significance of the pact between the Soviet Union and Japan
                                relating to neutrality, as reported in the press today, could be
                                overestimated. The agreement would seem to be descriptive of a
                                situation which has in effect existed between the two countries for
                                some time past. It therefore comes as no surprise, although there
                                has existed doubt whether the two Governments would or would not
                                agree to say it in writing. The policy of this Government, of
                                course, remains unchanged.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: During recent years the Government of
                        the United States has been examining the treaties of commerce and navigation
                        in force between the United States and foreign countries with a view to
                        determining what changes may need to be made toward better serving the
                        purposes for which such treaties are concluded. In the course of this
                        survey, the Government of the United States has come to the conclusion that
                        the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan
                        which was signed at Washington on February 21, 1911, contains provisions
                        which need new consideration. Toward preparing the way for such
                        consideration and with a view to better safeguarding and promoting American
                        interests as new developments may require, the Government of the United
                        States, acting in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Article XVII
                        of the treaty under reference, gives notice hereby of its desire that this
                        treaty be terminated, and, having thus given notice, will expect the treaty,
                        together with its accompanying protocol, to expire six months from this
                        date.</p>

                        last paragraph. The following statement was issued last night by the Foreign
                        Office: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The American Government has formally notified our Government through
                                our Embassy at Washington its desire to terminate the treaty of
                                commerce and navigation between Japan and the United States. As the
                                step has been taken by the American Government all of a <pb n="190"
                                    xml:id="pg_190" facs="0256"/>sudden and, moreover, the reasons
                                given therefor are given only very briefly, it is difficult to grasp
                                the true motive underlying the action of the American
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>It is stated by the American Government that during recent years it
                                has been examining all the existing treaties between the United
                                States and foreign countries with a view to determining what changes
                                should be made and that, having come to the conclusion that the
                                Japanese-American treaty contains provisions which need new
                                consideration and in order to safeguard and promote American
                                interests as new developments may require, it desires the
                                termination of the treaty.</p>
                            <p>However the above reasons of the American Government which serve
                                equally well for a revision of the treaty fail to explain fully why
                                the American Government should have found it necessary to give
                                notice of the abrogation in such a hasty and abrupt manner.</p>
                            <p>Although the American Government claims that the notification in
                                question has no connection whatever with the deliberations in the
                                Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on the proposal of Senator
                                Vandenberg for the abolition of the Japanese-American treaty of
                                commerce and navigation, the present action of the American
                                Government coming as it does at the time when the Anglo-Japanese
                                conversations are in progress is highly susceptible of being
                                generally interpreted as having a political significance.</p>
                            <p>A new situation is now fast developing in East Asia. The Japanese
                                Government has long been hoping that other countries of the world
                                would frankly recognize this fact. In case the American Government
                                desires to conclude a new treaty with Japan in conformity with this
                                new situation in East Asia the Japanese Governmet will of course be
                                glad to do so.”</p>

                        Government to define its position concerning the question of the negotiation

                                    expressed its willingness to enter into commercial treaties or
                                    agreements with all countries on the basis of certain well-known
                                    principles and procedures <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191"
                                        facs="0257"/>which this Government regards as fundamental to

                                <item>2. The Government of the United States regards
                                    non-discriminatory treatment as the foundation principle of its
                                    commercial policy and considers the rule of equality of
                                    commercial rights and opportunity to be the only practicable and
                                    desirable basis for concluding commercial treaties or
                                    agreements. The history of the commercial policies of the
                                    leading trading nations of the world demonstrates conclusively
                                    that the negotiation of commercial agreements based upon any
                                    other principle leads inevitably to friction and the taking of
                                    counter measures by injured third nations, to the stifling of
                                    the legitimate trade of all nations, and to chaotic
                                    international commercial relations. In the past, when the
                                    principal restrictions on trade consisted of tariff duties,
                                    non-discriminatory treatment could usually be assured by mutual
                                    general pledges of equality of treatment; but in recent years
                                    new forms of trade restrictions, such as quantitative
                                    limitations, monopolistic instrumentalities, exchange control,
                                    and related measures affecting importation and exportation of
                                    goods and remittance of funds, have achieved such importance as
                                    methods of regulating trade that, to ensure non-discriminatory
                                    treatment, it has been found necessary to have’ new provisions
                                    supplementing the standard provision or rule of equality of
                                    treatment. For example, with regard to quantitative limitations
                                    on trade it has been found essential, in order that
                                    non-discriminatory treatment may be established beyond dispute,
                                    to have in force an expressly defined procedure assuring
                                    exporting countries opportunity to supply fair shares in the
                                    total of imports permitted. Similarly, with regard to exchange
                                    control, it is important that there be established a procedure
                                    providing for the supplying of foreign exchange for trading and
                                    other purposes in such a manner as to ensure against
                                    discrimination. In the light of modern experience, the
                                    Government of the United States regards as a <hi rend="italic"
                                        >sine qua non</hi> of entering into negotiations with any
                                    country looking toward the conclusion of a commercial treaty or
                                    agreement, that it be understood in advance that
                                    non-discriminatory treatment is to be made the basis for
                                    commercial intercourse and that there are to be established
                                    procedures designed to ensure non-discriminatory
                                    treatment.</item>
                                <item>3. In contemplating the negotiation of a commercial treaty or
                                    agreement with any country on the foregoing basis, it is
                                    naturally appropriate for the Government of the United States to
                                    examine not only the policies and practices of the country in
                                    question as they are applied within that country’s territory but
                                    also the policies and practices of that country as they affect
                                    American trade with and in third countries. Substantial and
                                    continuing discriminations against the commercial interests of
                                    the United States brought about by the influence or by agencies
                                    of any country within the territory of a third country are
                                    obviously injurious to the United States. If such
                                    discriminations have been imposed in a third country against
                                    that country’s wishes it is apparent that the discriminations
                                    can be removed most effectively and expeditiously by action on
                                    the part of the nation which imposes, or which causes the
                                    imposition of, the discriminations. Such discriminations are at
                                    present in effect throughout large areas of China occupied by
                                    Japanese armed forces. These discriminations have been brought
                                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0258"/>about by agencies
                                    which are directed by the Japanese Government or agents thereof
                                    and which exercise control over the economic life of such areas
                                    to the special advantage of Japanese interests through such
                                    instrumentalities as exchange and currency control, levies upon
                                    and restriction of exports and imports, monopolies, and
                                    restrictions upon navigation of China’s waterways and upon
                                    travel and residence and trade in various parts of China.</item>
                                <item>4. It follows that so long as agencies and instrumentalities
                                    of the Japanese Government continue in fact to render
                                    inoperative the practice of equality of treatment for American
                                    commercial interests throughout large areas of China, there
                                    exists a serious obstacle to the conclusion by the United States
                                    of a new commercial treaty or agreement with Japan. Entirely
                                    apart from the question of existing treaty commitments and
                                    treaty rights, this obstacle to the conclusion of a new
                                    commercial treaty or agreement would be present by virtue of the
                                    discriminatory practices which at present thus prevail in the
                                    occupied areas in China.</item>
                                <item>5. In giving consideration to the question of entering with
                                    any other country into a new treaty or agreement for the
                                    regulation of commerce, the Government of the United States, in
                                    both its executive and its legislative branches, must and does
                                    take full account not only of the treatment accorded by the
                                    authorities of the other country, in areas under the control of
                                    those authorities, to American goods and American enterprises,
                                    but also of the treatment accorded by those authorities in such
                                    areas to American commerce as a whole, including American
                                    nationals, American firms, American investments, and American
                                    economic and cultural activities in general. The principle of
                                    equality of treatment is applicable in all areas and carries
                                    implicit within itself the principles of non-discrimination and
                                    fair treatment.</item>
                                <item>6. The Government of the United States has set forth
                                    hereinbefore what it regards as important considerations bearing
                                    on the question of the concluding of a new commercial treaty or
                                    agreement between the United States and Japan. The Government of
                                    the United States hopes that the Japanese Government likewise
                                    attaches importance to these considerations, and the Government
                                    of the United States will be glad to have evidence of the steps
                                    which the Japanese Government is taking toward giving practical
                                    effect to its attitude. Certain of these considerations have
                                    recently been discussed between the American Ambassador to Japan
                                    and the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs in informal
                                    conversations in Tokyo, and should the Japanese Government
                                    desire further information in regard to them the Government of
                                    the United States is of course ready to furnish it.”</item>

                    <p>404. Supplementary to and in amplification of the Department’s telegram No.
                        402, December 18, 2 p.m. Although the statement of the United States
                        Government’s position, transmitted in Department’s telegram No. 402, deals
                        only with the commercial aspects of our relations with Japan, that fact does
                        not signify that the United States Government has in any way modified its
                        position with regard to other aspects of Japanese-American relations. The
                        United States Government continues, of course, to adhere to the full import
                        of its position as stated on numerous occasions in its communications to the
                        Japanese Government, and especially in its communications to the Japanese
                        Government dated October 6, 1938, and December 31 [<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>The Department has given careful study to the telegrams under reference. The
                        Department concurs in your view that it would not be advisable in response
                        to the initiative taken by the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs to
                        return a categorical negative which would serve to close the door to further
                        discussions and to discourage the efforts of the Japanese Government. At the
                        same time we are not in position to commit ourselves now to entering upon a
                        negotiation. We are inclined to feel that the negotiation of a new treaty
                        with the thought of holding ratification of such treaty in abeyance until
                        the Japanese Government should have carried out certain assurances would be
                        likely to produce more potentialities of misunderstanding and of
                        disadvantage than would a treatyless condition. We are receiving numerous
                        inquiries with regard to the effect which termination of the treaty will
                        have upon relations between the United States and Japan. To these inquiries
                        we are replying that the absence of a commercial treaty does not of itself
                        cause an interruption in commercial relations; that in such circumstances
                        those relations are governed <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0260"/>in
                        each country by its municipal law or practice, subject, of course, to any
                        applicable principles of international law; that in the opinion of the
                        Department the expiration of the treaty of 1911 with Japan will not produce
                        of itself any changes in the general customs duties or treatment applicable
                        to imports of Japanese goods into the United States; and that, similarily,
                        there does not appear reason to expect that the termination of the treaty
                        will produce of itself any marked changes in the general customs duties or
                        treatment applicable in Japan to imports from the United States.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the proposal made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a
                            <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> be entered into, we prefer to leave
                        our attitude toward that proposal open for the time being. We shall give the
                        matter consideration but wish you to know that our tentative thought is that
                        any <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> which might upon further study
                        commend itself to us under existing circumstances would have to be of a very
                        limited scope, to relate principally to rights of establishment and not of
                        trade, and to be of a character which would leave this Government free to
                        impose restrictions upon trade in case developments should make such course
                        appear necessary toward better safeguarding American interests.</p>
                    <p>The Department is hoping to be able to send you tomorrow in continuation of
                        the above a suggested text of a statement which we feel you might helpfully
                        make orally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

                        them that the 10 percent ad valorem discriminating duties under Section IV,
                        paragraph J, subdivision 1 of the Tariff Act of 1913 are not to be collected
                        unless and until further instructions are issued. The question of
                        application of the duties had arisen, according to importers, because of the
                        impending expiration on January 26, 1940, of the Treaty of Commerce and
                        Navigation with Japan, dated February 21, 1911.</p>
                    <p>The text of the circular letter is as follows:</p>

                        <p>Inquiries have been received concerning the expiration on January 26,

                            February 21, 1911, with respect to the imposition of discriminating
                            duties under section IV, paragraph J, subsection 1 of the Tariff Act of
                            1913, 38 Stat. 195 (U. S. C. title 19, sec. 128; title 46, <pb n="196"
                                xml:id="pg_196" facs="0262"/>sec. 146), saved from repeal by section
                            651(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 763. Attention is directed to
                            the coordinate provision of the Act of May 24, 1828, 4 Stat. 308,
                            substantially reenacted in section 4228 of the Revised Statutes of 1873,
                            as amended by the Act of July 24, 1897, 30 Stat. 214 (U. S. C. title 46,
                            sec. 141), authorizing the President, under certain conditions, to issue
                            a proclamation suspending discriminating duties. Attention is also
                            directed to a proclamation issued by President Grant on September 4,
                            1872 (17 Stat. 956), suspending discriminating duties with respect to
                            Japan. Since that proclamation appears not to have been revoked, the
                            Treasury Department has reached the tentative conclusion that the
                            proclamation will again be operative upon the expiration of the Treaty
                            of Commerce and Navigation with Japan and that no discriminating duties
                            under the statute cited above will be imposed, in the absence of
                            Executive or Congressional action.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, no estimated or other duties shall be collected
                            under 38 Stat. 195 (U. S. C. title 19, sec. 128; title 46, sec. 146),
                            unless and until this circular is superseded by further
                            instructions.</p>

                        view of the Secretary’s indisposition, the Ambassador was received by Mr.

                        Following the call there was made available to press correspondents

                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Japanese Ambassador asked three questions. He asked whether on

                                change in the import duties and tonnage rates. He was told that
                                expiration of the treaty would not of itself bring about any
                                changes. In reply to further inquiries by the Ambassador he was told
                                that as this Government has made clear repeatedly, future commercial
                                relations between the two countries will depend upon
                                developments.</p>
                            <p>He asked whether there were any possibilities of an exchange of notes
                                between the two Governments defining the status of treaty relations
                                and was told that this would have to be held open and would
                                presumably form a part of the discussions which have been taking
                                place in Tokyo.</p>
                            <p>He asked the status of Japanese merchants who, under treaty

                                between the United States and Japan, it is expected that

                    <p>48. The following statement is to be handed by the Foreign Office to the
                        press at 10 p.m. for release at midnight today Tokyo time: <quote

                            <p>“On July 26, 1939, the Government of the United States of America
                                through our Ambassador at Washington communicated to the Japanese
                                Government their desire to abrogate on a six months’ notice the
                                Japanese-American treaty of commerce and navigation concluded at
                                Washington on February 21, 1911, for the reason that there were
                                provisions in the said treaty requiring new consideration, and for
                                the purpose that the way might be prepared for such consideration
                                and that the treaty be rendered capable of better safeguarding and
                                promoting American interests as new development might require.</p>
                            <p>It appears that the abrogation was intended by the American
                                Government to be of service in the solution of various questions
                                arising between Japan and America in connection with the China
                                affair.</p>
                            <p>In view of the importance of the complementary and mutually
                                beneficial trade relations between Japan and America, and because
                                Japan’s policy in the present China affair is not aimed at
                                eliminating the just and reasonable interests of third powers in
                                China, but on the contrary there are, it is firmly believed, many
                                fields for cooperation between Japan and third powers in creating a
                                new East Asia, the Japanese Government deemed it appropriate to
                                elucidate further their position to the American Government and to
                                seek readjustment of the relations between the two countries. To
                                this end our Government have continued and are still continuing to
                                exert great efforts. At the same time they have conducted
                                negotiations regarding a new treaty, or at least regarding a measure
                                for preventing the advent of a treatyless situation. While
                                negotiations are still in progress on these matters, unfortunately
                                no agreement has been reached so far, leaving Japan and America
                                without a treaty from today.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the American Government, in order that
                                Japanese-American trade relations should not unduly suffer, took
                                steps through decrees issued toward the end of 1939 by the Treasury
                                and the Department of Commerce to exempt Japanese ships from light
                                dues and from additional tonnage duties and the 10 percent ad
                                valorem <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0264"/>discriminatory
                                duties on cargoes brought in by Japanese vessels. The Japanese
                                Government have no intention to discriminate in any way against
                                American goods or vessels, and they have already taken the necessary
                                measure in that regard. Consequently, despite the non-treaty
                                situation, the commercial relations between Japan and America will
                                in practice be subject to no change.</p>
                            <p>Japanese subjects now residing in, or going to, America in the
                                capacity of the so-called “treaty merchant” are to be treated
                                hereafter by the American Government as temporary visitors. But this
                                is not considered likely to cause any special difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Though the trade relations between Japan and America, as stated
                                above, will on the whole remain unaltered, a treatyless situation
                                which renders unstable the relations in general as well as the trade
                                between the two countries, is undesirable for both Japan and
                                America.</p>
                            <p>It is confidently hoped that through the negotiations that are being
                                continued the Japanese-American relations will be restored to a
                                normal state with a treaty basis.”</p>

                        Japanese treaty merchants.</p>
                    <p>On the afternoon of January 23 the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy called
                        on an officer of the Department to discuss this matter and urged that the
                        Department agree to initial a minute on the subject. The opinion was
                        expressed to the Counselor that the drawing up and initialing of any minute
                        in reference to such a matter would be inappropriate and would lead to
                        misunderstanding and misinterpretation. The Counselor was informed, however,
                        that the Department’s reply to a note which had been received from the
                        Japanese Embassy a few days previously relating to Japanese who made
                        frequent visits from Seattle to Vancouver would contain a statement in
                        substantial conformity with the statement given by Mr. Berle to the Japanese
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>This reply, which went forward to the Japanese Embassy on January 24,
                        included <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> information along the lines of
                        the penultimate paragraph of the Department’s telegram under reference and a

                    <p>As some misunderstanding appears to have arisen as to the purport of the
                        statement made by the Secretary of State in his press conference on June 11
                        in regard to bombing civilian populations from the air, I am addressing this
                        letter in regard to the matter to all persons and companies registered as
                        manufacturers or exporters of airplanes or aeronautical equipment.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the Secretary’s statement definitely condemned
                        bombing of civilian populations from the air, it should be clear to all
                        concerned that the Government of the United States is strongly opposed to
                        the sale of airplanes or aeronautical equipment which would materially aid
                        or encourage that practice in any countries in any part of the world.
                        Therefore, in view of this policy, the Department would with great regret
                        issue any licenses authorizing exportation, <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202"
                            facs="0268"/>direct or indirect, of any aircraft, aircraft armament,
                        aircraft engines, aircraft parts, aircraft accessories, aerial bombs or
                        torpedoes to countries the armed forces of which are making use of airplanes
                        for attack upon civilian populations.</p>
                    <p>Should any manufacturer or exporter have already entered into contractual
                        obligations, of which he finds it impossible to divest himself, to sell or
                        export airplanes or aeronautical equipment, for which licenses have been
                        issued or for which he has heretofore intended to apply for licenses, to any
                        country which is engaged in bombing civilian populations from the air, it is
                        suggested that he may wish to inform the Department of the terms of that
                        contract before applying for licenses to export pursuant to it or before
                        exporting under licenses already issued.</p>

                            <p>“This Government hopes, to the end that such unprovoked bombing shall

                    <p>The Department, after consultation with the War and Navy Departments, has

                    <p>This decision has been reached with a view to conserving in this country

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called and handed me the attached notes,<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d130fn7">These notes apparently consisted of the one printed <hi

                            understandings between the Japan Gasoline Company and Universal Oil
                            Products Company (not printed).</note> which are self-explanatory. I
                        inquired whether he desired a written reply to the note in regard to moral
                        sanctions, including an alleged contract between a Japanese company and
                        American citizens concerning technical processes and manufacturing rights
                        for the production of certain petroleum products. He said that the Japanese
                        Government would like to have a written reply. I then remarked that he no
                        doubt was aware of the fact that the so-called moral embargo on all phases
                        of the airplane situation found its origin in and was based on the bombing
                        of civilian populations from the air in China by the Japanese, and that I
                        would probably list a great number of these bombings as reported to this
                        Government and allow them to be published together with the balance of the
                        contents of the note. The Ambassador appeared very startled at this idea,
                        and repeated the request of his Government for a written reply.</p>
                    <p>With regard to technical processes for high-test gasoline, I stated that this
                        Government, concerned as it is with the increase of war and the use or
                        threat of force in so many parts of the world, feels constrained to conserve
                        a number of the more vital interests it has in defense commodities or
                        materials, and that this, together with our abhorrence of the bombings of
                        civilian populations, is the basis for the conservation of the gasoline
                        manufacturing processes to which the Ambassador referred.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador brought up the question of the violation by this Government of
                        the Treaty of Commerce of 1911.<note n="8" xml:id="d130fn8"><ref

                                1911, p. 315</ref>.</note> I said, without going into the merits of
                        the matter, that I trusted his Government would not forget how many times
                        American commercial rights and interests have suffered injury in China
                        contrary to all treaties and all law, and that notwithstanding this fact,
                        this Government and others perhaps were expected to be perfectly quiescent
                        while being deprived of their right to participate in economic and other
                        undertakings in China, although the Japanese Government would expect to
                        enjoy the benefits of the rule of equality in its economic dealing with all
                        the Western world. I then added that, as I had heretofore stated to the
                        Ambassador, the subject of commercial treaties was under discussion between
                        Mr. Grew and the Foreign Office at Tokyo, and that we were deferring the
                        entire matter to that discussion for the time being.<note n="8a"

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that, as the result
                        of a communication through a circular letter of July 1, 1938, addressed by
                        the Department of State to manufacturers and exporters of aircraft and
                        aircraft parts, in which it was mentioned that “the Department of State
                        would with great regret issue any licenses authorizing exportation, direct
                        or indirect, of any aircraft, aircraft armament, aircraft engines, aircraft
                        parts, aircraft accessories, aerial bombs or torpedoes to countries the
                        armed forces of which are making use of airplanes for attack upon civilian
                        populations,” it has virtually become impossible for Japanese firms to
                        import any airplanes and airplane parts of American make.</p>
                    <p>As repeatedly stated by my Government, military operations of the Japanese
                        air forces in China have been directed solely against warlike organizations
                        and establishments of the Chinese. No bombing or machine-gunning has been
                        resorted to against civilian populations as such. The Japanese Government,
                        therefore, cannot but take exception to any treatment of Japan as a country
                        “the armed forces of which are making use of airplanes for attack upon
                        civilian populations.”</p>
                    <p>The above-mentioned measures employed by the Department of State, which, in
                        view of the great influence that can be wielded by a <pb n="206"
                            xml:id="pg_206" facs="0272"/>central government upon private
                        manufacturers and exporters, have the effect of a discriminatory export
                        embargo. My Government considers that such measures applied to Japan are in
                        derogation of the provision of Article V, paragraph 3 of the Treaty of
                        Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the United States of February 21,
                        1911, and at variance with the general purposes of the Treaty as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>While my Government was keenly alive to the unfortunate consequences of the
                        said communication to American exporters, it did not relinquish the hope
                        that the United States Government, in harmony with its fair and just trade
                        policy, would before long retract it.</p>
                    <p>However, on December 16, 1939, another letter was addressed by the Department
                        of State to manufacturers and exporters to the effect that the Department
                        hoped that it would not receive any application for a license to authorize
                        the exportation, direct or indirect, of articles enumerated in the letter of
                        July 1, 1938, and, in addition thereto, of aeronautical equipment of all
                        kind and materials essential to airplane manufacture. In order to point out
                        that molybdenum and aluminum should be included among such materials, a
                        letter was addressed by the Department to all producers of these two
                            materials.<note n="9" xml:id="d131fn9">For texts of the two letters, see
                            press release of December 15, 1939, <ref target="#pg_202">p.
                            202</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Still further, it was announced on December 20, 1939, from the Department of
                        State that the decision had been reached that there should be no further
                        delivery to certain countries of plans, plants, manufacturing rights, or
                        technical information required for the production of high quality aviation
                        gasoline and that this decision had been communicated to the interested
                        American oil companies. The announcement cited the decision as an extension
                        of the United States Government’s policy in regard to the sale of airplane,
                        aeronautical equipment, and materials essential to airplane manufacture to
                        countries the armed forces of which were engaged in unprovoked bombing or
                        machine-gunning of civilian populations from the air.</p>
                    <p>Of late there occurred a number of cases in which the purchase of certain
                        articles and materials under negotiation between Japanese firms and
                        interested American companies has been rendered impossible as the result of
                        the Department of State’s letters.</p>
                    <p>To cite one of the most outstanding cases, a memorandum of a contract was
                        drawn and initialed August 19, 1938, by representatives of Japan Gasoline
                        Company on the one part and Universal Oil Products Company on the other.</p>
                    <p>It was stipulated that Universal Oil Products Company, which since 1928 had
                        maintained close business connection with Japan Gasoline Company, should
                        grant a license in Japan covering their polymerization processes for the
                        production of iso-octanes and rights <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0273"
                        />under all of their processes in the entire petroleum field, in return for
                        which Japan Gasoline Company should pay $1,000,000 United States funds to
                        Universal Oil Products Company.</p>
                    <p>It was understood that, during the progress of the negotiations in connection
                        with the above agreement, the representatives of Universal Oil Products
                        Company approached and laid the pertinent facts before the Department of
                        State, which made no objection to the transaction.</p>
                    <p>Under the terms of the agreement Japan Gasoline Company paid to Universal Oil
                        Products Company a sum of $300,000 on October 30, 1938, and $400,000 on July
                        8, 1939. It was agreed that further payment of $100,000 was to be made at
                        the time of delivery of plans and specifications for a plant and a final
                        payment of $200,000 upon completion and test of such a plant. In essence,
                        Universal Oil Products Company was bound to guarantee, within the limit of
                        the money it was to receive in payment, complete working of the plant in
                        Japan under polymerization processes.</p>
                    <p>Recently Universal Oil Products Company proposed that a final agreement
                        should be made along the lines of the provisional agreement, and accordingly
                        the two parties continued their negotiations.</p>
                    <p>On December 19, 1939, however, Universal Oil Products Company informed the
                        representatives of Japan Gasoline Company that they had received a letter
                        from the Department of State which left no alternative for them but to
                        withhold further fulfillment of the terms of the contract.</p>
                    <p>The consummation of this contract, under which the greater part of the
                        payment involved has already been made and other obligations required have
                        been completely fulfilled by one of the parties, has for all practical
                        purposes been frustrated.</p>
                    <p>Entertaining the belief that steps taken by your Government, causing a
                        situation not dissimilar in effect to that which might obtain under an
                        export embargo discriminating against Japan, are in contravention to the
                        provisions of Article V, paragraph 3, of the Treaty of Commerce and
                        Navigation between Japan and the United States and at variance with the
                        spirit of the Treaty as a whole and fearing that the continuation of such
                        measures may affect the present earnest efforts of Japan and the United
                        States for the improvement of mutual friendly relations through the
                        maintenance and promotion of commerce between the two countries, my
                        Government greatly deplores the herein referred to actions of the
                        authorities of the United States Government</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                        receipt of Your Excellency’s note No. 2 of January 6, 1940, in which you
                        refer to measures which have been taken by the Government of the United
                        States in pursuance of its policy of condemning and discouraging the bombing
                        and machine-gunning of civilian populations from the air. You state that as
                        a result of these measures it has become virtually impossible for Japanese
                        firms to import any airplanes or airplane parts of American make and that in
                        a number of recent cases the completion of purchases which were already
                        under negotiation between Japanese firms and interested American companies
                        has been rendered impossible. You state further that no bombing or
                        machine-gunning of civilian populations as such has been resorted to by the
                        Japanese forces in China and that the Japanese Government, therefore, cannot
                        but take exception to any treatment of Japan as a country the armed forces
                        of which are making use of airplanes for attack upon civilian populations.
                        You also express the view that the measures taken by this Government caused
                        a situation not dissimilar in effect to that which might obtain under an
                        export embargo against Japan and were in contravention of the provisions of
                        the third paragraph of Article V of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of
                        1911 between Japan and the United States and at variance with the spirit of
                        the treaty as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The attitude and policy of the Government of the United States in connection
                        with the unprovoked bombing and machine-gunning of civilian populations are
                        clearly indicated in the Department of State’s press release of June 3,

                        determined not by any arbitrary finding of the American Government, but by
                        the observable acts of the armed forces of such country or countries as may
                        be engaged in military operations.</p>
                    <p>With reference to your statement that “military operations of the Japanese
                        air forces in China have been directed solely against warlike organizations
                        and establishments of the Chinese” and that no bombing or machine-gunning of
                        civilian populations as such has been <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209"
                            facs="0275"/>resorted to, the Department of State observes that
                        trustworthy, detailed reports have come to this country, some official and
                        some by way of private sources and the public press, which indicate that in
                        their military operations in China the Japanese forces have in a large
                        number of instances resorted to bombing and machine-gunning of civilians
                        from the air at places near which there were no military establishments or
                        organizations. Furthermore, the use of incendiary bombs (which inevitably
                        and ruthlessly jeopardize non-military persons and properties) has inflicted
                        appalling losses on civilian populations. Japanese air attacks in many
                        instances have been of a nature and apparent plan which can be comprehended
                        only as constituting deliberate attempts to terrorize unarmed populations. I
                        would invite attention for example to the large number of air attacks upon
                        the intramural city of Nanking from August 15, 1937, until the occupation of

                        have continued down to very recent date. It is positively known that
                        Japanese planes have attacked civilian populations at a large number of
                        other places, which to cite further examples include the following: <hi

                    <p>It is appropriate to mention also reports received by the Department of State
                        that as recently as January 18, 1940, a number of large Japanese bombing
                        planes attacked a group of undefended fishing villages on Woga Island near
                        Foochow and caused the death and injury of a substantial number of civilians
                        as well as the destruction of a substantial number of dwellings.</p>
                    <p>That there have been reported to date approximately 200 instances in China of
                        damage by aerial bombs to American properties, the location of the majority
                        of which were previously notified to the Japanese authorities and nearly all
                        of which were marked by American flags, is <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210"
                            facs="0276"/>an indication of the extent and the indiscriminate nature
                        of Japanese aerial bombing operations over widespread areas. The Japanese
                        Government could scarcely expect that the American people would or could
                        look with complaisance upon attacks by the Japanese forces upon non-military
                        objectives with results so disastrous to American interests. Furthermore,
                        the bombing of so large a number of American properties—which were chiefly
                        mission premises in the interior—carries the strong implication that the
                        concurrent loss generally of civilian life and destruction of civilian
                        property in these interior places were appallingly great.</p>
                    <p>Reference is made to your statement to the effect that the Universal Oil
                        Products Company, upon the receipt by it of a letter from the Department of
                        State, was left no alternative but to withhold further fulfillment of a
                        provisional agreement with the Japan Gasoline Company, and in particular to
                        your statement that the pertinent facts in regard to the proposed
                        transaction were communicated to the Department of State by the Universal
                        Oil Products Company during the progress of negotiations and that the
                        Department made no objection. It is observed that the Department of State’s
                        informal indication of non-objection to the installation in plants in
                        foreign countries of certain processes for the production of iso-octane fuel
                        was given before the continued widespread bombing and machine-gunning of
                        civilian populations in certain areas impelled the American people and this
                        Government to extend the policy of condemnation of that practice to include
                        the withholding of delivery of technical processes for the production of
                        high quality aviation gasoline from countries the armed forces of which are
                        engaged in unprovoked bombing and machine-gunning of civilian populations
                        from the air. Furthermore, the Government of the United States, concerned as
                        it is with the increase and spread of war and the use or threat of force in
                        so many parts of the world, has recently felt constrained to conserve vital
                        interests which this Government has in certain commodities and technical
                        processes relating to the national defense.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing circumstances, the American Government is unable to
                        agree that its action in inviting American exporters voluntarily to
                        cooperate with the policy pursued by the American people and by this
                        Government of condemning and discouraging the bombing and machine-gunning of
                        civilian populations from the air constituted an infringement of either the
                        letter or the spirit of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911
                        between the United States and Japan.</p>

                    <p>5. The shipper’s export declarations must contain the same information in
                        regard to the nature and value of the articles and materials to be exported
                        as that which appears in the application for license.</p>
                    <p>6. Export licenses are not transferable and are subject to revocation without
                        notice. If not revoked, licenses are valid for one year from the date of
                        issuance.</p>
                    <p>7. No alterations may be made except by the Department of State or by
                        collectors of customs or postmasters acting under the specific instructions
                        of the Department of State in export licenses which have been issued under
                        the seal of the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>8. Export licenses which have been revoked or which have expired must be
                        returned immediately to the Secretary of State.</p>
                    <p>9. The country designated on the application for license as the country of
                        destination shall in each case be the country of ultimate destination. If
                        the goods to be exported are consigned to one country with the intention
                        that they be transshipped thence to another country, the latter country
                        shall be named as the country of destination.</p>
                    <p>10. Applications for license shall contain adequate descriptions of the
                        articles and materials to be exported, including type and model descriptions
                        if applicable. If an application is submitted in which the articles to be
                        exported are inadequately described, it will be returned to the applicant
                        for completion in this respect.</p>
                    <p>11. The original license must be presented, prior to exportation, to the
                        collector of customs at the port through which the shipment authorized to be
                        exported is being made. If shipment is made by parcel post, the license must
                        be presented to the postmaster at the post office at which the parcel is
                        mailed.</p>
                    <p>12. Articles and materials entering or leaving a port of the United States in
                        transit through the territory of the United States to a foreign country will
                        not be considered as imported or exported for the purposes of these
                        regulations.</p>

                    <p>The Materials and Production Divisions of the National Defense Advisory

                    <p>The Japanese Government has taken note of the Proclamation, dated July 26,
                        1940, by the President of the United States of America, for the
                        administration of section 6 of the Act of Congress approved <pb n="219"
                            xml:id="pg_219" facs="0285"/>July 2, 1940, entitled “An Act to expedite
                        the strengthening of the national defense,” and the Regulations, dated July
                        26, 1940, governing the exportation of articles and materials designated in
                        the President’s Proclamation of July 2, 1940, and the anouncement of July 31
                        recommended by Colonel R. L. Maxwell, Administrator of Export Control.</p>
                    <p>The announcement of July 31, the introduction to which stated that it was
                        issued with the approval of the President, is as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“In the interests of the National Defense the export of aviation
                                gasoline is being limited to nations of the Western Hemisphere,
                                except where such gasoline is required elsewhere for the operations
                                of American owned companies.”</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>It is the understanding of the Japanese Government that the announcement
                        expresses the policy to be followed by the Government of the United States
                        in applying the above mentioned Proclamations and Regulations to the export
                        of aviation gasoline and that that policy, by limiting the export
                        destinations, is tantamount to an embargo on aviation gasoline so far as
                        countries outside the Western Hemisphere are concerned. As a country whose
                        import of American aviation gasoline is of immense volume, Japan would bear
                        the brunt of the virtual embargo. The resultant impression would be that
                        Japan had been singled out for and subjected to discriminatory
                        treatment.</p>
                    <p>While reserving all rights of further action, the Government of Japan wishes
                        to protest against the policy of the Government of the United States set
                        forth in the announcement under review.</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the Japanese Ambassador’s note of August 3, 1940 in
                        regard to action taken by the Government of the United States, in pursuance
                        of section 6 of the Act of Congress approved July 2, 1940 entitled “An Act
                        to expedite the strengthening of the national defense”, to restrict the
                        export of aviation gasoline from the United States. The Japanese Ambassador
                        indicates that the impression created by that action, in view of Japan’s
                        large imports of American aviation gasoline, is that Japan has been singled
                        out for and subjected to discriminatory treatment. Accordingly, the Japanese
                            <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0286"/>Ambassador records the Japanese
                        Government’s reservation of rights and its protest against the policy of the
                        Government of the United States involved in the action under reference.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States desires to state that the action under
                        reference, as was mentioned in the proclamation issued by the President of
                        the United States on July 26, 1940, referred to in the Japanese Embassy’s
                        note under acknowledgment, is necessary in the interest of the national
                        defense and that, accordingly, this Government considers a protest by any
                        foreign government against that action to be unwarranted.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Government has taken note of the regulations governing the
                        exportation of iron and steel scrap, dated September 30, 1940, amending the
                        construction and definition of the term “iron and steel scrap” included in
                        the regulations of July 26, 1940, and the announcement <pb n="224"
                            xml:id="pg_224" facs="0290"/>of September 26, 1940 to the effect that,
                        under the new regulations, licenses will be issued to permit shipments to
                        the countries of the Western Hemisphere and Great Britain only.</p>
                    <p>The above mentioned regulations refer to the Presidential authority derived
                        from the provisions of section 6 of the Act of Congress approved July 2,
                        1940, entitled “An Act to expedite the strengthening of the national
                        defense”, thereby suggesting that it was determined to be necessary in the
                        interest of national defense to curtail the exportation of iron and steel
                        scrap.</p>
                    <p>In view of the situation of iron and steel scrap markets, the supply and
                        demand of these materials and the volume shipped to Japan, the Japanese
                        Government finds it difficult to concede that this measure was motivated
                        solely by the interest of national defense of the United States.</p>
                    <p>In the note of the Japanese Ambassador of August 3 the Japanese Government
                        pointed out that the measure announced on July 26, 1940, in regard to the
                        exportation of aviation gasoline, was tantamount to an export embargo as far
                        as countries outside the Western Hemisphere were concerned. Compared to that
                        announcement, the announcement under review may be said to have gone a step
                        further toward discrimination by specifically excluding Great Britain from
                        the virtual embargo.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that Japan has been for some years the principal buyer of
                        American iron and steel scrap, the announcement of the administrative
                        policy, as well as the regulations establishing license system in iron and
                        steel scrap cannot fail to be regarded as directed against Japan, and, as
                        such, to be an unfriendly act.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese Government hereby protests against the measures taken by the
                        United States Government in connection with the exportation of iron and
                        steel scrap.</p>

                            State by the Japanese Ambassador on October 8, 1940.</note></head>
                    <p>Since iron and steel scrap classified as No. 1 heavy melting scrap was placed
                        under export-licensing system on July 26, 1940, permission of the United
                        States Government was obtained up to August 19 of the same year for 99
                        percent of applications for shipments to Japan.</p>
                    <p>In the light of this fact, the sudden enlargement of the iron and steel scrap
                        licensing system to include all grades of these materials is hardly <pb
                            n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0291"/>explicable from the standpoint of
                        national defense, on which the regulation of September 30, 1940, is
                        purported to be based.</p>
                    <p>The discriminatory feature of the announcement, that licenses will be issued
                        to permit shipments to the countries of the Western Hemisphere and Great
                        Britain only, has created a widespread impression in Japan that it was
                        motivated by a desire to bring pressure upon her.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the majority of essential articles and materials that Japan
                        desires to import from America is placed under licensing system is causing a
                        feeling of tension among the people of Japan, who naturally presume that the
                        system is intended to be a precursor of severance of economic relations
                        between Japan and the United States.</p>
                    <p>In view of the high feeling in Japan it is apprehended that, in the event of
                        continuation by the United States Government of the present attitude toward
                        Japan in matters of trade restriction, especially if it leads to the
                        imposition of further measures of curtailment, future relations between
                        Japan and the United States will be unpredictable.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of course that the Governments of both Japan and the United
                        States should endeavor as best they can to preclude such an eventuality. To
                        this endeavor the Japanese Government will devote itself and trusts that it
                        may have the full co-operation of the United States Government.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request. He first expressed his regret
                        at the unsatisfactory relations existing between our two countries at this
                        time. I replied that, in my opinion, this was not the fault of the
                        Ambassador and myself, who have been untiring in our efforts to promote and
                        preserve satisfactory relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that he was instructed by his Government to hand me
                        a note dated October 7, 1940 (copy attached)<note n="22" xml:id="d148fn22"
                            >Note No. 235, <ref target="#pg_223">p. 223</ref>.</note> relative to
                        our scrap iron and steel embargo which was recently proclaimed.</p>
                    <p>He read a statement (copy attached)<note n="23" xml:id="d148fn23"><hi
                                rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> in support of the note mentioned
                        above.</p>
                    <p>I replied to the effect that I would see what sort of written reply, if any,
                        might be called for.</p>
                    <p>I then said that I might at this time, and without delay, state that this
                        Government at all times must determine for itself such internal questions as
                        those material to our program of national defense, as we <pb n="226"
                            xml:id="pg_226" facs="0292"/>are doing in the instant case, and that it
                        would be impossible for any country engaged in the serious and urgent
                        undertaking of carrying out a program of national defense to allow every
                        other outside nation to come in and pass upon the question of our needs of
                        given commodities; that the embargo, as the Ambassador knows, applies to all
                        nations except Great Britain and the Western Hemisphere. I remarked that for
                        some years this Government had been criticized for not imposing numerous
                        embargoes, primarily from the standpoint of safety and national defense and
                        peace, and that it was only at the height of our national defense
                        preparations that we were imposing a few embargoes on important
                        commodities.</p>
                    <p>I said that it was really amazing for the Government of Japan, which has been
                        violating in the most aggravating manner valuable American rights and
                        interests throughout most of China, and is doing so in many instances every
                        day, to question the fullest privilege of this Government from every
                        standpoint to impose the proposed scrap iron and steel embargo, and that to
                        go still further and call it an unfriendly act was still more amazing in the
                        light of the conduct of the Japanese Government in disregarding all law,
                        treaty obligations and other rights and privileges and the safety of
                        Americans while it proceeded at the same time to seize territory by force to
                        an ever-increasing extent. I stated that of all the countries with which I
                        have had to deal during the past eight years, the Government of Japan has
                        the least occasion or excuse to accuse this Government of an unfriendly act.
                        I concluded with the statement that apparently the theory of the Japanese
                        Government is for all other nations to acquiesce cheerfully in all injuries
                        inflicted upon their citizens by the Japanese policy of force and conquest,
                        accompanied by every sort of violence, unless they are to run the risk of
                        being guilty of an unfriendly act.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador again said that he very much regretted the serious differences
                        between our two countries, but that he naturally hoped that trouble may yet
                        be avoided. He added that any Japanese or any American must know that strife
                        between the two countries would be extremely tragic for both alike. To this
                        I replied that, of course, it would be exceedingly unfortunate for such
                        occurrence to take place, but I added that my Government has been patient,
                        extremely patient, and that the Ambassador will bear witness to the long and
                        earnest efforts that he and I have made, and that I have made prior to his
                        coming here, to promote and preserve friendly and satisfactory relations
                        with Japan. I went on to say that we have stood for law and order and treaty
                        observance and justice along with genuine friendliness between our two
                        countries; that it was clear now, however, that those who are dominating the
                        external policies of Japan are, as we here have believed <pb n="227"
                            xml:id="pg_227" facs="0293"/>for some years, bent on the conquest by
                        force of all worthwhile territory in the Pacific Ocean area without limit as
                        to extent in the South and in southern continental areas of that part of the
                        world, and that we and all other nations are expected, as stated, to sit
                        perfectly quiet and be cheerful and agreeable, but static, while most of
                        Asia is Manchuria-ized, which would render practically impossible all
                        reasonable or satisfactory relations so far as other nations are concerned;
                        and that corresponding lower levels of existence would be the ultimate lot
                        of the people of most of Asia. The least objection to or taking of issue
                        with Japan with respect to the foregoing matters would be called an
                        unfriendly act, and, as Prime Minister Konoye said recently to the press, it
                        would be the occasion for war so far as Japan was concerned.<note n="23a"
                            xml:id="d148fn23a">Apparently reference is to statement of October 4,
                            1940; not printed.</note> I added that, of course, if any one country is
                        sufficiently desirous of trouble, it can always find any one of innumerable
                        occasions to start such trouble. In brief, it is not left to the other
                        country to participate in such decision.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador undertook to repeat the old line of talk about how fair Japan
                        proposed to be with respect to all rights and privileges of foreign nations
                        within its conquered territory. He agreed that no purpose would be served
                        now to go over the many conversations we have had with respect to these
                        matters. I held up the succession of injuries to American rights and
                        interests in China whenever he referred to the scrap iron embargo.</p>
                    <p>I reiterated the view that it was unheard of for one country engaged in
                        aggression and seizure of another country, contrary to all law and treaty
                        provisions, to turn to a third peacefully disposed nation and seriously
                        insist that it would be guilty of an unfriendly act if it should not
                        cheerfully provide some of the necessary implements of war to aid the
                        aggressor nation in carrying out its policy of invasion. I made it clear
                        that it is the view of this Government that two nations, one in Europe and

                        resembling that of 750 years ago. In the face of this world movement,
                        extending itself from day to day, peaceful and interested nations are to be

                        conquest.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador had little to say. He said virtually nothing in attempted
                        extenuation except that his Government would expect everybody to receive
                        considerate and fair treatment throughout the conquered areas, tie

                        articles and materials needed for the national defense have been subject to
                        the export-licensing system. Since the passage of the last-named act, many
                        applications for licenses have been refused as a result of decisions by the
                        Administrator of Export Control that the proposed exportation would be
                        contrary to the interests of the national defense. The articles or materials
                        for which export licenses have been refused have in many cases already been
                        sold and the title has passed to a foreign purchaser. It has been found
                        that, in some of these cases, purchasers did not desire to sell the article
                        or material in the United States or, because they were acting in a
                        representative capacity, they were not legally in a position to do so. This
                        situation has been particularly acute in the case of some exportations of
                        machine tools. A great many of these tools for which export licenses have
                        been refused are especially needed to meet national-defense
                        requirements.</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the note dated October 7, 1940, from the Japanese
                        Embassy at Washington, in which objection is expressed by the Japanese
                        Government to the regulations promulgated by the American Government on
                        September 30, 1940, with regard to the exportation of iron and steel scrap,
                        such objection being placed apparently on the ground that the restrictions
                        to be effected by the regulations are discriminatory and are calculated to
                        be injurious to Japan.</p>
                    <p>As was pointed out in the first paragraph of the Japanese Embassy’s note, the
                        regulations under reference derive from the provisions of section 6 of the
                        Act of Congress approved July 2, 1940, entitled “An Act to expedite the
                        strengthening of the national defense”. It having been found by the
                        appropriate agencies and authorities of this Government that the
                        restrictions on exportation to be effected by the regulations under
                        reference are necessary in the interest of national defense, the Government
                        of the United States perceives no warrantable basis for a raising of
                        question by any other government, in the circumstances—not of this
                        Government’s making—which prevail today in international relations, with
                        regard to the considerations which necessitate the adoption by this
                        Government of these measures of conservation.</p>

                                a license for export unless they were needed in the domestic market.
                                Export licenses for certain machine tools were denied. Attempts were
                                thereupon made to sell them to the domestic market, but it developed
                                that nobody wanted them. Therefore the Chargé thinks the denial of

                    <p>The Japanese Chargé d’Affaires came in to see me at his request. He had on
                        his mind the fact that his Government had raised the question of export
                        licenses for certain machine tools, and had called to the attention of the
                        Department the fact that certain kinds of machine tools, notably cutters and
                        grinders, were not listed as requiring licenses. Nevertheless, shipments of
                        these tools had been held up.</p>
                    <p>He now pointed out that in the recent circular to collectors of customs, they
                        were directed not to permit export of tool and cutter grinders until further
                        notice. In other words, though licenses were not required, the collectors of
                        customs were nevertheless not permitted to allow these tools to go
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>I said I would have the matter looked into, but I called the Counselor’s
                        attention to the fact that export of these articles was at all times
                        dominated by our needs for national defense. If the Defense Commission felt
                        such tools were needed, they would undoubtedly require them to be licensed;
                        and, as had happened when the Act was first passed, the first step is to
                        hold up shipment pending a more or less careful examination. I could not,
                        therefore, assure him that arrangements would be made prior to December 10
                        permitting these tools to go forward. I did agree, however, that the
                        Department would look into the matter.</p>

                        machine tools.<note n="31" xml:id="d153fn31">Not printed; see memorandum by

                    <p>As the Embassy is aware, each application to export a machine tool is
                        examined by the interested agencies of this Government with a view to
                        determining whether or not the tool in question is needed in the United
                        States defense program. In view of the constant and rapid expansion which
                        this program is undergoing, it frequently becomes necessary to revoke a
                        license already granted, since the too] which it seemed at the time of the
                        issuance of the license could be dispensed with has thereafter been found to
                        be essential to the program. Attention should also be invited to the fact
                        that, even though a particular tool for the exportation of which application
                        is made may not he needed in the defense program, the application may
                        nevertheless be rejected if the manufacture of the tool in question would
                        occupy production capacity needed for the manufacture of other tools which
                        are essential to the program.</p>
                    <p>It should be pointed out, moreover, that other considerations are also
                        weighed by those agencies of the Government responsible for the issuance of
                        export licenses. On December 2, 1939, the President publicly stated the
                        policy of this Government in regard to the export of materials essential to
                        aircraft manufacture to countries the armed forces of which engage in the
                        unprovoked bombing from the air of civilian populations. This policy is
                        naturally taken into consideration by those officers responsible for the
                        granting or rejection of export license applications:</p>
                    <p>The Embassy refers to the revocation of licenses for tools which collectors
                        of customs had previously been informed could be exported without the
                        requirement of a license. The attention of the Embassy is invited to the
                        fact that collectors of customs were informed that no license would be
                        required for the export of these types of tools “until further notice”. In
                        view of the fact that the expanding defense program of this Government makes
                        the conservation of machine tool production capacity for its own needs
                        constantly more necessary, collectors of customs were recently instructed
                        that licenses will be henceforth required for the export of additional types
                        of machine tools, including those types listed in the enclosure to the
                        Embassy’s note.</p>

                                ferro alloys, and certain iron and steel manufactures and
                                semimanufactures to the licensing requirement. Licenses will be
                                granted for exports to the British Empire and the Western
                                Hemisphere; and for the present, so far as the interests of the

                    <p>The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the Chargé d’Affaires ad
                        interim of Japan and refers to the memoranda of November 30 and December 4,
                        1940, of the Japanese Embassy,<note n="35" xml:id="d157fn35">Neither
                            printed.</note> in regard to the requirement that licenses be obtained
                        for the export of certain machine tools which collectors of customs had been
                        previously instructed might be exported without a license.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State, in reply, invites attention to the fourth paragraph
                        of his note of December 9, 1940, in which he pointed out that this
                        instruction to collectors of customs contained the stipulation that licenses
                        would not be required for the export of these types of tools “until further
                        notice”. On November 25 the Department advised collectors of customs that on
                        and after December 10, 1940, all of these types of tools would be subjected
                        to the licensing requirement. Prior to November 25, however, the Department,
                        pursuant to the desires of the Administrator of Export Control with whom
                        rests full authority in matters of this sort, had had occasion to inform
                        both collectors of customs and manufacturers that licenses would be required
                        in certain individual cases for the export of certain specific tools of the
                        types previously exempted, which tools are pressingly needed in the defense
                        program of the United States. These specific instructions, which amended the
                        instructions of July 27, 1940 and, in contradistinction to the instructions
                        of November 25, took effect immediately, account for the course pursued in
                        the individual cases referred to in the Embassy’s memoranda of November 30
                        and December 4, 1940.</p>

                        strengthening of the national defense,” approved July 2, 1940, and of the
                        “White House announcement” of the same date, stating, in part, that
                        “licenses will be granted for exports to the British Empire and Western
                        Hemisphere, and for the present, so far as the interests of the national
                        defense permit, for exports to other destinations in quantities
                        approximating usual or pre-war exports.”</p>
                    <p>The enforcement of the measure ordered by the President in the Proclamation,
                        especially when carried out in accordance with the policy as announced—that
                        is the granting of licenses for exports exclusively to certain countries
                        while subjecting exports to other countries to the considerations of “the
                        interests of the national defense” and to arbitrary quantitative
                        limitations—constitutes an instance of discriminatory treatment of countries
                        in the latter category, of which Japan, in consideration of the volume of
                        her importation in recent years of the specified commodities, would be one
                        of those most gravely affected.</p>

                        regulations, and announcements of administrative policy governing the
                        exportation of aviation gasoline and iron and steel scrap, by the Japanese

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this evening at his request. The
                        Ambassador asked if I would lend my good offices in helping to solve a
                        situation which had been created owing to the fact that three Japanese
                        steamers had been held up at Cristobal on the Atlantic side of the Panama
                        Canal and that some six other Japanese steamers were now headed for the
                        Canal for the purpose of transiting. The Ambassador said that these steamers
                        could not transit, although he had word from Japanese shipping sources that
                        ships of other nationalities were being permitted to transit.</p>
                    <p>I said to the Ambassador that I would be glad to investigate and if I had any
                        information which would be useful to him, I would be glad to have it
                        transmitted. I said that it was my understanding that about July 11 the
                        Canal authorities had issued an order notifying shipping that repairs had to
                        be undertaken in the Canal and that for that reason merchant shipping which
                        desired to transit the Canal would have to be prohibited or severely
                        restricted for an indefinite <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0330"
                        />period. The Ambassador inquired with regard to the report he had
                        concerning the fact that other flagships were being enabled to come through.
                        I said that if this were in fact the case, I assumed that they must be
                        merchant ships carrying material required for the United States defense
                        program and I said I was of course sure the Ambassador would agree that it
                        was entirely logical to suppose that if any exceptions were made, ships
                        carrying cargoes urgently required for our defense program would be granted
                        preference.</p>

                    <p>Volunteer Participation Committee. President Roosevelt yesterday received at
                        the White House the Volunteer Participation Committee made up of
                        representatives from all parts of the country who have volunteered for
                        civilian defense activities. Speaking informally to this group President
                        Roosevelt said in part:</p>
                    <p>“There are lots of things that people don’t quite understand. You are an
                        information bureau to all of them. And I will give you the example.</p>
                    <p>“Here on the East Coast, you have been reading that the Secretary of the
                        Interior, as Oil Administrator, is faced with the problem of not enough
                        gasoline to go around in the East Coast, and how he is asking everybody to
                        curtail their consumption of gasoline. All right. Now, I am—I might be
                        called an American citizen, living in Hyde Park, N. Y. And I say, ‘That’s a
                        funny thing. Why am I asked to curtail my consumption of gasoline when I
                        read in the papers that thousands of tons of gasoline are going out from Los
                        Angeles—West Coast—to Japan; and we are helping Japan in what looks like an
                        act of aggression?’</p>
                    <p>“All right. Now the answer is a very simple one. There is a world war going
                        on, and has been for some time—nearly two years. One of our efforts, from
                        the very beginning, was to prevent the spread of that world war in certain
                        areas where it hadn’t started. One of those areas is a place called the
                        Pacific Ocean—one of the largest areas of the earth. There happened to be a
                        place in the South Pacific where we had to get a lot of
                        things—rubber—tin—and so forth and so on—down in the Dutch Indies, the
                        Straits Settlements, and Indochina. And we had to help get the Australian
                        surplus of meat and wheat, and corn, for England.</p>
                    <p>“It was very essential from our own selfish point of view of defense to
                        prevent a war from starting in the South Pacific. So our foreign policy
                        was—trying to stop a war from breaking out down <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265"
                            facs="0331"/>there. At the same time, from the point of view of even
                        France at that time—of course France still had her head above water—we
                        wanted to keep that line of supplies from Australia and New Zealand going to
                        the Near East—all their troops, all their supplies that they have maintained
                        in Syria, North Africa and Palestine. So it was essential for Great Britain
                        that we try to keep the peace down there in the South Pacific.</p>
                    <p>“All right. And now here is a nation called Japan. Whether they had at that
                        time aggressive purposes to enlarge their empire southward, they didn’t have
                        any oil of their own up in the north. Now, if we cut the oil off, they
                        probably would have gone down to the Dutch East Indies a year ago, and you
                        would have had war.</p>
                    <p>“Therefore, there was—you might call—a method in letting this oil go to
                        Japan, with the hope—and it has worked for two years—of keeping war out of
                        the South Pacific for our own good, for the good of the defense of Great
                        Britain, and the freedom of the seas.</p>
                    <p>“You people can help to enlighten the average citizen who wouldn’t hear of
                        that, or doesn’t read the papers carefully, or listen to the radio
                        carefully—to understand what some of these apparent anomalies mean. So, on
                        the information end, I think you have got just as great a task as you have
                        in the actual organization work.</p>
                    <p>“Now on this organization—to come back to that for a minute—it is amazing the
                        number of letters I get here in the White House–and my wife in the White
                        House—from men and women in literally every County in the United States—who
                        are pleading to be told what they can do to help. They honestly are ready to
                        work.</p>
                    <p>“So my message to you is: Act as starters of this ‘horse race’.”</p>

                    <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister, called at his request. After taking up
                        what he described as two matters of official business, Mr. Wakasugi said
                        that he wished to speak to me personally in regard to the present state of
                        relations between the United States and Japan. He said that we had known
                        each other for a number of years and that he therefore felt that he could
                        speak frankly. He mentioned the fact that he had been in this country a good
                        many years and he indicated that he was very much disturbed at the present
                        trend of relations between our two countries. He asked whether there was any
                        comment I could make as to how the present trend might be arrested and
                        relations be improved.</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0332"/>
                    <p>I then commented at some length in regard to developments in relations
                        between the United States and Japan, emphasizing the fact that the American
                        people and the American Government had been very patient, that the
                        Government had been subjected to severe criticism from the American people
                        because it had not taken certain steps, that no one had worked harder for or
                        had more on his heart the maintenance of friendly relations with Japan than
                        the Secretary of State, that Japan had nothing to fear from any other
                        country, that if Japan followed a peaceful course it would not encounter
                        trouble with the United States or any other country, and that the question
                        of maintaining and developing friendly relations between two countries was
                        of course a two-way proposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wakasugi then came to what I regard as the purpose of his approach. He
                        said that he had noted in the papers this morning that a number of Japanese
                        vessels were staying out at sea and were not coming into American ports. He
                        said that he imagined that someone had created a fear in the minds of the
                        steamship companies that the ships might be detained or seized by this
                        Government. He continued that if this Government could give assurances that
                        the ships would not be detained or seized, of course the ships could then
                        come in. He asked whether I could give him such assurances. I replied that I
                        could not; that all I knew about the matter was that I had seen reports in
                        the late papers last evening and again in the papers this morning to the
                        effect that these Japanese ships were standing out at sea; that the idea
                        that it might be advisable for these ships to stay out at sea must have
                        originated from some Japanese source; and that certainly this Government had
                        not asked the Japanese ships to stay out at sea. I repeated, in reply to Mr.
                        Wakasugi’s further query, that of course I was not in position to give
                        assurances in as much as all I knew about the matter was what I had read in
                        the papers.</p>

                    <p>This Executive Order, just as the Order of June 14, 1941, is designed among

                        national defense and American interests, to prevent the liquidation in the
                        United States of assets obtained by duress or conquest, and to curb

                        extended the freezing control to Chinese assets in the United States. The
                        Administration of the licensing system with respect to Chinese assets will
                        be conducted with a view to strengthening the foreign trade and exchange
                        position of the Chinese government. The inclusion of China in the Executive
                        Order, in accordance with the wishes of the Chinese government, is a
                        continuation of this Government’s policy of assisting China.</p>

                    <p>440. On July 28 the Japanese Ambassador called at his request. He said with
                        reference to the freezing order of this Government <pb n="268"
                            xml:id="pg_268" facs="0334"/>that the question of how Japanese vessels
                        in American waters would be affected was giving his Government great
                        uneasiness and he therefore desired any information I could give him. I told
                        the Japanese Ambassador that under present conditions and for the time being
                        prompt clearance would be granted by the Treasury Department to any Japanese
                        vessels in American ports which wished to clear. In reply to a further
                        inquiry I told the Ambassador that while purchase by those vessels of food
                        supplies and fuel would require specific licenses from the Treasury
                        Department, licenses would be granted for such transactions for the time
                        being and under present conditions in order to enable those ships to clear
                        from ports in this country. The Ambassador expressed satisfaction with my
                        replies.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Iguchi, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, called this afternoon at his
                        request. He said that the Japanese Ambassador had instructed him to call and
                        make inquiries in regard to questions relating to the cargo on board the
                        Japanese vessel, <hi rend="italic">Tatuta Maru</hi>. Mr. Iguchi said that
                        when the Japanese Ambassador’had seen Mr. Welles yesterday the Ambassador
                        had not raised the question of cargoes aboard Japanese vessels. Mr. Iguchi
                        said that it had now developed that according to U. S. Customs regulations,
                        a clearance permit for a ship would not be issued unless the cargo destined
                        for the port in question should have been discharged. Mr. Iguchi said that
                        this represented the usual American procedure. He said that in this
                        connection he wished, under instruction from the Ambassador, to raise the
                        question whether it would be possible to alter this procedure and permit
                        clearance of the vessel without discharge of cargo or, if this should not be
                        possible, what would happen to the cargo. He asked whether the cargo would
                        be frozen. Mr. Iguchi said that the Ambassador desired that we be so good as
                        to find out the answers to the questions which Mr. Iguchi had asked.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this morning at my request. The
                        Ambassador said that he would like to know what <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269"
                            facs="0335"/>decisions this Government might have reached with regard to
                        the cargoes which were on the ships waiting to enter American ports, and
                        whether these cargoes would be “frozen”, I said that I had nothing further
                        that I could say to the Ambassador with regard to these ships other than
                        what I had already stated to him, and that with regard to the question of
                        the cargoes specific and individual licenses would have to be applied for to
                        the Treasury Department, which would reach a decision in each case in
                        accordance with the policy of this Government and upon the merits of the
                        individual application.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that the reason why he had always had such great
                        admiration for the United States was because he believed that in our
                        dealings with other countries we pursued a policy which was “fair and
                        square”. He said that while he recognized the question was one solely for
                        our own determination he had nevertheless hoped that greater “leniency”
                        would be shown with regard to the cargoes on these ships. To this I replied
                        that I appreciated what the Ambassador said concerning the policy of my
                        Government and that I believed that the Ambassador’s remarks to the effect
                        that American policy was “fair and square” were entirely accurate. I said I
                        felt that in the specific instance to which he referred our policy had been
                        entirely in line with our traditional policy in that regard. I said further
                        that I wondered if the Ambassador felt that the policy of Japan towards
                        American interests in the Far East during the past four years had been
                        equally “fair and square”. Somewhat to my surprise the Ambassador burst into
                        a loud laugh and said, “You have me there”. He said that he feared that
                        Japanese policy had not been one to which that phrase could be properly
                        applied.</p>

                    <p>I telephoned Mr. Iguchi of the Japanese Embassy and, referring to his call
                        yesterday and the questions he then raised in regard to cargo aboard the <hi
                            rend="italic">Tatuta Maru</hi>, told him I wished, under instruction, to
                        supplement information communicated by Mr. Welles to the Ambassador this
                        morning when the Ambassador raised the question of the treatment of cargo on
                        board Japanese vessels. I referred to the fact that Mr. Welles had informed
                        the Ambassador that no assurances could be given in regard to whether funds
                        would be <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0336"/>released or would not be
                        released to cover any cargo landed from such ships and that applications for
                        licenses would be given appropriate consideration if and as they were
                        individually presented. I said that we understood that the Treasury
                        Department was making arrangements whereby Japanese ships, if they did not
                        wish to discharge their cargo, would be granted clearances and permitted to
                        sail with cargo aboard. I told Mr. Iguchi that I understood that the
                        Treasury Department was communicating information to the foregoing effect to
                        the agents or owners of the Japanese steamship companies in this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Iguchi thanked me for communicating the foregoing information to him and
                        said that he would bring it to the attention of the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Later, following conference with Mr. Acheson<note n="61" xml:id="d189fn61"
                            >Dean Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State.</note> and conference by
                        Mr. Acheson with Mr. Foley of the Treasury Department, I telephoned Mr.
                        Iguchi and told him that I wished to give him further information on two
                        points: I said that the first point was that the provision to the effect
                        that Japanese ships could, if they desired, enter American ports and leave
                        without discharging cargoes applies only to Japanese ships coming in before
                        next Saturday (August 2), midnight. I explained that ships coming in before
                        that date and desiring to leave without discharging cargoes would be given a
                        reasonable time to leave. I said that the second point was that if a
                        Japanese ship’s manifest showed that cargo aboard the ship was destined to
                        an American port and the ship did not wish to discharge that cargo upon
                        arrival at an American port, the ship should correct the manifest at sea to
                        show that no cargo was destined for discharge at an American port. I told
                        Mr. Iguchi also that if the Japanese Embassy wished further particulars on
                        and clarification of these matters, an officer of the Embassy might care to
                        get in touch with the Commissioner of Customs at the Treasury
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>I went over the foregoing twice with Mr. Iguchi and he said that he
                        understood.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this evening.</p>
                    <p>I explained to the Ambassador the reasons why Mr. Acheson and officials of
                        the Treasury and Justice Departments had requested Mr. Iguchi <pb n="271"
                            xml:id="pg_271" facs="0337"/>of the Japanese Embassy to call upon them
                        yesterday afternoon in connection with the libel actions brought by private
                        individuals in the United States against the Japanese steamer now in San
                        Francisco. I explained that these actions Vere brought by private
                        individuals and that the statements I had officially made to the Ambassador
                        regarding the willingness of this Government to grant prompt clearance to
                        the vessel were in no wise modified. I stated that I thought it extremely
                        important that the Japanese Embassy consult competent counsel in order to
                        take the measures which might be necessary to expedite action concerning
                        these libel actions and that the appropriate officials of this Government,
                        either in Washington or in San Francisco, would be glad to be helpful to the
                        Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Consulate General regarding this question.
                        The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for what I said.</p>

                        that ships outside American ports with cargo might come in with the cargo
                        and leave with it without hindrance from the Treasury. I pointed out that
                        this assurance, as a practical matter, was no longer important because of
                        the action of private parties in filing libel suits.</p>
                    <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0338"/>
                    <p>I stated to Mr. Iguchi, as I had been instructed to do by the Acting
                        Secretary, that under present conditions this Government had no intention of
                        interfering with Japanese ships; that such ships might come in, might
                        discharge cargo consigned to American ports, would be granted sufficient
                        supplies and fuel for the return voyage and would be given clearance and
                        departure permits. I cautioned him again that on account of libels filed
                        against cargoes it was not possible to give any assurance regarding the
                        cargoes. I also pointed out that the assurance of freedom of departure was
                        predicated on the continuance of existing conditions. He said that he
                        earnestly hoped that there would be no change in these conditions for the
                        worse.</p>

                        Government’s claim of immunity was allowed. The Secretary at the same time
                        requested that the appropriate courts in the ports which the vessels would
                        visit should be advised of this matter and that all proper steps be taken
                        toward recognition by those courts of the immunity of these three Japanese

                    <p>Mr. Suma, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, called at his request. He said
                        that the Japanese Ambassador was absent in Havana where he was presenting
                        his credentials as Japanese Minister to Cuba and that, the Ambassador being
                        away, he had called to communicate on behalf of the Ambassador and under
                        instruction from his Government certain information in regard to the Sinnan
                        Islands. Mr. Suma thereupon handed me the attached paper<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d194fn1"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> in which there is
                        described the location of the Sinnan Islands, the Japanese Government’s
                        claim in regard to the Islands, action taken by the French Government in
                        reference to the Islands, and the action of the Japanese Government in
                        incorporating the Islands in the territory under the jurisdiction of the
                        Government-General of Formosa as of March 30, 1939. Mr. Suma also handed me
                        the attached map<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Not printed.</note> with the
                        statement that the Japanese Embassy here had marked on the map in a red
                        broken line a rough approximation of the area comprising the Islands. I
                        remarked that the Sinnan Island group appeared to be very near to the
                        Philippine Islands. I asked Mr. Suma whether he had ever been to the
                        Islands, to which he replied in the negative. I asked him to what use the
                        Islands could be put and he replied that they were useful chiefly by reason
                        of their phosphate deposits.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Suma said that in reference to islands which had previously been “no
                        State’s land” international law provided that a government desiring to
                        acquire such land must have made known its intentions in the matter and must
                        also have set up certain establishments on the islands. He said that the
                        French Government had set up no establishments on the Islands.</p>
                    <p>At that moment there came to my desk the ticker report from Tokyo in which it
                        was stated that the Japanese Foreign Office had announced today that it had
                        advised France that Japan was annexing the Spratly Island group off the
                        southeast coast of French Indochina. I read the news report aloud to Mr.
                        Suma. I said that <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0344"/>there seemed to
                        be an important difference between the information contained in the news
                        report and the information which Mr. Suma had just communicated, namely,
                        that the news report referred to the Spratly Island group. I asked whether
                        “Spratly” was another name for “Sinnan”. Mr. Suma replied in the negative.
                        He said that the Sinnan Islands comprised a much larger area than Spratly
                        Island.</p>
                    <p>I said that I understood that Mr. Suma was communicating the information set
                        forth in the attached paper informally and for the information of the
                        Department. He replied in the affirmative and said that his Government was
                        doing this in view of the fact that it had as of yesterday incorporated the
                        Sinnan Islands in the territory under the jurisdiction of the
                        Government-General of Formosa.</p>
                    <p>I said that we would study the information communicated by Mr. Suma; and that
                        I would bring it to the attention of higher officers of the Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Suma said that if there should be any further data which we would like to
                        have he would be glad, upon request, to endeavor to obtain it.</p>

                    <p>The names of the principal coral reefs of the Sinnan Islands are:
                        Kitahutagozima, Minamihutagozima, Nisiaozima, Sankakuzima (Thi tu Island),
                        Nakakozima (Loai ta Island), Kikkozima, Nanyoto, Nagasima (Itu Aba Island),
                        Kitakozima, Minamikozima, Asukazima, Nisitorisima (Spratly Island) and
                        Marusima (Amboyna Cay).</p>
                    <p>2. The Sinnan Islands were no State’s land until June, 1921, when <pb n="279"
                            xml:id="pg_279" facs="0345"/>the Rasa Phosphate Co., a Japanese concern,
                        having made extensive investigation of the Islands since 1917, invested a
                        considerable amount of money in the building of permanent establishments for
                        the development of the Islands. Their enterprise received the full
                        authorization and support of the Japanese Government, which dispatched a
                        naval surveying ship, <hi rend="italic">Koshu</hi>, in 1929. In April of the
                        same year a stone monument was built signifying the Japanese occupation,
                        replacing a wooden marker built in 1919. (A more imposing one was erected in
                        August 1938 with due ceremony conducted by the officers and crew of the
                        minelayer <hi rend="italic">Katsuriki</hi>.) In 1931, however, the Japanese
                        settlers concerned were obliged to leave the Islands temporarily on account
                        of business depression, but manifested their intention of returning to the
                        Islands by leaving the establishments as they stood. In fact the work of
                        development on the Islands was resumed in 1936 by the Kaiyo Development Co.
                        of Formosa and has continued to date.</p>
                    <p>3. During the absence of the Japanese settlers, in July, 1933, the French
                        Government dispatched a warship and publicly proclaimed their acquisition,
                        contending that the Islands had previously belonged to no State, and sent a
                        notification to that effect to the Japanese Government.</p>
                    <p>Finding itself unable to accept the view of the French Government expressed
                        in the said notification, the Japanese Government, in August of the same
                        year, made friendly representations to the French Government to the effect
                        that the proclamation of acquisition should be withdrawn. Upon refusal on
                        the part of the French Government, the Japanese Government made it clear
                        that they do not in any way recognize the French claim to the Islands, and
                        have taken all necessary measures to ensure the acquisition of the Islands
                        as well as to give protection to the rights and interests therein of the
                        Japanese Government and the Japanese nationals concerned. The cruiser <hi
                            rend="italic">Tatsuta</hi> was dispatched to the Islands in 1935 and the
                        minelayer <hi rend="italic">Katsuriki</hi> in 1936, 1937 and 1938, and a
                        police officer from the Government-General of Formosa was stationed
                        [there?].</p>
                    <p>4. In 1937 the French Government, relying solely on the above-mentioned
                        proclamation of acquisition, again claimed the sovereignty of the Islands,
                        and in July of 1938 dispatched to the Islands a merchant vessel, landed some
                        men and materials, and commenced to build establishments. The Japanese
                        Government firmly sustained their refusal to recognize the French
                        contention. At the same time the Japanese authorities on the Islands
                        demanded the withdrawal of the French and objected to the hoisting of the
                        French flag and the landing of goods on the Islands.</p>
                    <p>5. The Japanese Government, basing their action on the close connection that
                        has existed between the Islands and the Japanese Empire <pb n="280"
                            xml:id="pg_280" facs="0346"/>and on the right deriving therefrom under
                        International Law, and motivated by their desire to avoid the possibility of
                        further complications with the French Government, incidental to the hitherto
                        vague administrative status of the Islands, have incorporated the Sinnan
                        Islands in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Government-General of
                        Formosa as of the thirtieth of March 1939.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Reference is made to the memorandum,
                        with an accompanying map, left with the Department on March 31 last by Mr.
                        Suma reporting the incorporation of the so-called Sinnan Islands into the
                        territory under the jurisdiction of the Government-General of Formosa as of
                        March 30, 1939. It is stated in the memorandum that the Sinnan Islands
                        comprise small coral reefs which lie within an area described in the
                        memorandum and delimited on the map aforementioned. There are listed in the
                        memorandum the names of what are stated to be the principal coral reefs of
                        the Sinnan Islands, which are in the main situated along the westerly side
                        of the area delimited. Reference is also made in the memorandum to the
                        claims of France to the Islands.</p>
                    <p>In 1933 the Government of the United States was informed by the French
                        Government of its claim to sovereignty over certain islands situated along
                        the western side of the area described in the Japanese memorandum. Recently
                        this Government has been informed by the French Government that on February
                        27, 1939, it had suggested to the Japanese Government that the difference
                        between France and Japan on the subject of the sovereignty of the islands be
                        submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. Apart from any
                        question as to the merits of the conflicting claims of France and Japan, it
                        may be observed that, as the Japanese Government is aware, the Government of
                        the United States advocates adjustment of problems in international
                        relations by processes of negotiation, agreement or arbitration.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States does not consider that all islands or
                        reefs which might be situated within the extensive area delimited in the
                        Japanese memorandum, and especially within that considerable part of the
                        area lying to the eastward and southeastward of any of the islands named in
                        the Japanese memorandum, can properly be treated as one island group, nor
                        does this Government consider that the action of Japan in blanketing within
                        the territory of Japan islands or reefs, either known or unknown, with
                        respect to <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0347"/>which the Japanese
                        Government has heretofore exercised no acts which may properly be regarded
                        as establishing a basis for claim to sovereignty, has any international
                        validity.</p>

                    <p>On being questioned by newspapermen concerning Japan’s position with regard
                        to possible involvement of the Netherlands in the European war and its
                        repercussions in the Netherlands East Indies, Foreign Minister Arita replied
                        as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“With the South Seas regions, especially the Netherlands East Indies,
                                Japan is economically bound by an intimate relationship of mutuality
                                in ministering to one another’s needs. Similarly, other countries of
                                East Asia maintain close economic relations with these regions. That
                                is to say, Japan, these countries and these regions together are
                                contributing to the prosperity of East Asia through mutual aid and
                                interdependence.</p>
                            <p>“Should hostilities in Europe be extended to the Netherlands and
                                produce repercussions, as you say, in the Netherlands East Indies,
                                it would not only interfere with the maintenance and furtherance of
                                the above-mentioned relations of economic interdependence and of
                                co-existence and co-prosperity, but would also give rise to an
                                undesirable situation from the standpoint of the peace and stability
                                of East Asia. In view of these considerations, the Japanese
                                Government can not but be deeply concerned over any development
                                accompanying an aggravation of the war in Europe that may affect the

                            <p>“The Netherlands Indies are very important in the international

                                extend for a distance of approximately 3,200 miles east and west
                                astride of the Equator, from the Indian Ocean on the west far into
                                the Pacific Ocean on the east. They are also an important factor in
                                the commerce of the whole world. They produce considerable portions

                                rubber, tin, quinine, copra, et cetera. Many countries, including
                                the United States, depend substantially upon them for some of these
                                commodities.</p>

                    <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request. He said he came to discuss the
                        immigration situation as it exists today in the Philippine legislature. He
                        went over the general facts pertaining to the legislative and to the quota
                        situations and then asked that I urge the Philippine Government to allow
                        Japan, along with all other nations, 1,000 immigrants instead of 500, as
                        contemplated by the amendment to the bill on its second reading.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d199fn5">Commonwealth Act No. 613 (Second National Assembly,
                            second session), approved August 26, 1940.</note> I first made it clear
                        to the Ambassador that the Philippine Government has exclusive control over
                        this question of immigration into the Philippine Islands; that this
                        Government, therefore, does not undertake to dictate or otherwise bring
                        material pressure upon the Philippine officials. I then added that I would
                        be glad to go into the details of this matter further and somewhat
                        sympathetically and see whether and what might remain to be properly said by
                        this Government, if anything. The Ambassador remarked that this Government
                        had more or less jurisdiction over this matter, according to Dr. Sayre.<note
                            n="5a" xml:id="d199fn5a">Francis B. Sayre, U. S. High Commissioner,
                            Philippine Islands.</note> I corrected this wrong impression and also
                        brought to his attention that the bill in its entirety would make possible
                        the admission of about 1,000 Japanese instead of 500 only. I said to him
                        that if anything remained for us to say we would try to get it off
                        today.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then turned about a time or two in his chair and said that in
                        regard to the recent statements of Foreign Minister Arita and of myself in
                        regard to the <hi rend="italic">statics quo</hi> of the Netherlands East
                        Indies, he thought that our press misinterpreted Minister Arita and assumed
                        a more or less critical tone. I interrupted him to say that our press could
                        well have taken the lead given by the Japanese press on the day of and the
                        day after the statement of Minister Arita, which seemed to imply the
                        assumption of leadership and special influence in that area of the world
                        without limitation as to functions and purposes. I said that it may be
                        possible that the Japanese press misinterpreted Minister Arita. The
                        Ambassador then said that Minister Arita and I agree about not disturbing
                        the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of the Dutch East Indies. I replied in
                        the affirmative and said that the difference between us was that I placed
                        the matter on a far broader ground than one primarily affecting the
                        interests of Japan in the economic Dutch East Indies situation, and that I
                        need not elaborate upon this except to refer to my statement for full
                        understanding of the position this Government took. In that connection I
                        proceeded to say to the Ambassador that I wished <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284"
                            facs="0350"/>I could get over to him and his Government the fact that
                        there is no more resemblance between our Monroe Doctrine, as we interpret
                        and apply it uniformly since 1823, and the so-called Monroe Doctrine of
                        Japan than there is between black and white. I said our Monroe Doctrine only
                        contemplates steps for our physical safety while the Monroe Doctrine, as
                        practiced by Japan, is seemingly applicable to all other purposes and all
                        objectives, including economic, social, political, et cetera; that thus far
                        the question of a Monroe Doctrine for physical protection has not been
                        needed or invoked by Japan. The Ambassador sought to minimize my description
                        of the Japanese application of their so-called Monroe Doctrine when I
                        reminded him of its application in Manchuria and then, to our great
                        surprise, in China and then implied that it applies economically to the
                        Dutch East Indies.</p>
                    <p>I said to the Ambassador that his country can trade on absolutely equal terms
                        with mine and with all other nations in every port of every nation in this
                        hemisphere, with a slight modification temporarily in the Cuban trade
                        situation, which grows out of special conditions between the two countries.
                        I again reminded him of my frequent plea to his Government since 1933 to the
                        effect that there should be normal peaceful and other worthwhile relations
                        between important countries in the western world and Japan and China and
                        other countries in the eastern portion. I need not elaborate on the things I
                        have said on this point during past years except to emphasize the great
                        mutual commercial advantages and other extremely valuable advantages in many
                        ways that would follow such a policy of peaceful relationship and mutually
                        cooperative effort. I said if conditions go on as they are, Europe will go
                        bankrupt arid cannot get back on its feet until after a long period in the
                        future, while if Asia goes on as she is, both Japan and China will also find
                        themselves bankrupt, while the United States will be greatly handicapped in
                        its normal progress by wholesale bankruptcy in both Europe and Asia. The
                        Ambassador did not seriously dispute this phase of our conversation. He
                        sought to make it appear that Japan was motivated only by innocent purposes,
                        but I said that his Government’s formula in this respect does not work out
                        in practice as we have seen from Manchuria, China and other occurrences and
                        experiences; that this is especially true as to economic opportunity.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador remarked that we were sending a Consul to Iceland, to which I
                        replied in the affirmative.</p>
                    <p>He then inquired what new developments there were with respect to Greenland,
                        to which I replied that there were no new developments and no relations
                        about which the slightest question could be raised.</p>

                                despatches from Tokyo. During recent weeks a number of governments,
                                including Great Britain, Japan, and the United States, have made
                                clear in official public utterances their attitude of continued
                                respect for the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of the Netherlands
                                East Indies. This was in harmony with definite commitments formally
                                made in writing in 1922. This Government assumes that each of the
                                governments which has made commitments will continue to abide by

                    <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at his own request. He did not mention the
                        Philippine Immigration Bill, or the reported anti-Japanese disturbances in
                        Peru, or, expressly, the Netherlands Indies, or the status of European armed
                        forces in China. At the beginning of the conversation I made reference to
                        the increased state of war and chaos in other parts of the world and the
                        terrible destructive effects of it in every way, adding that it appeared
                        more and more as if no large country, much less a small country, was safe
                        from some aggressive intervention by force in one way or another, and that
                        about the only thing a nation could do was to arm to the teeth and be ready
                        for any serious interference with its rights and interests by the use of
                        military force or the threat of force. I said that, fortunately, as was
                        shown today in Congress, and as was apparent all over the nation since the
                        more recent invasions of helpless peaceful nations for purposes of their
                        destruction, the American people have now become thoroughly awakened,
                        aroused and alert in regard to any threatened injuries to American rights
                        and interests, and that this was a matter of great gratification to those of
                        us in charge of the foreign affairs of the nation.</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0352"/>
                    <p>The Ambassador then proceeded at great length to question and cross-examine
                        me about the Netherlands West Indies, comprising Curaçao and Aruba. I said
                        that, of course, my Government and the other twenty-one American Republics
                        would not consider for a moment any departure from their traditional policy
                        relating to the safety of this hemisphere, and if that was what the
                        Ambassador had in mind, I could make that statement together with the
                        further statement that as soon as this Government learned of the fact that
                        British and French vessels patrolling the waters near Curaçao and Aruba were
                        offering potential aid to the Netherlands Government in preventing possible
                        sabotage and possible armed expeditions from the mainland intended to seize
                        the governments on one or both of these possessions, such as governments are
                        often seized in South American countries, this Government proceeded to
                        assemble the facts as expeditiously as possible in regard to the ability of
                        Netherlands guards and citizens in Curaçao and Aruba to protect the islands
                        and their governments from such dangers. I further stated that it was my
                        understanding that the British and French patrols were in no sense
                        interfering with the Netherlands government on these two islands, but were
                        recognizing the authority of these governments during the brief temporary
                        time deemed necessary to aid in safeguarding against the dangers already
                        mentioned, and that they have made it clear that thereafter their patrols
                        will not offer any guards for additional protection in connection with their
                        continued patrol work, and hence there cannot arise the slightest question
                        of interference with the traditional American policy relating to its own
                        protection from possible dangers from abroad. Furthermore, the Netherlands
                        Government would be expected to send from abroad any additional guards that
                        may later be found to be needed. The Ambassador did not seem to be satisfied
                        with any sort of answer I made. He continued with an increasingly minute
                        cross-examination as it were. I suddenly and emphatically interrupted him
                        and with right inquired of him if his Government had sent him to me to ask
                        all these detailed questions about a matter of no importance to his
                        Government or to any other government, and if his Government had sent him to
                        go into this almost interminable examination, I desired now to know what the
                        motive and purpose of his Government was for doing so. I said that there
                        would never be any friction between my Government and any other government
                        on account of anything unlawful or unfair that my Government may do, but
                        that it would be due to something unlawful that another government may do. I
                        added that I had devoted most of the past seven years to efforts at
                        understanding and peaceful relations between our two Governments.</p>
                    <p>I then picked up two or three pages of material which had come in <pb n="287"
                            xml:id="pg_287" facs="0353"/>via the news ticker from Tokyo, in which
                        the Japanese Government is reported to be discussing every day or two some
                        phase of the Netherlands East Indies and its supposed special rights in
                        them. I stated that I had not intended to show him this, that it had just
                        come to my desk as the Ambassador came in, but I remarked with emphasis that
                        it had been thought that the Japanese Government and the Governments of the
                        United States, Great Britain and France had each and all repeated recently
                        their prior commitment that each was obligated to respect the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> in the Netherlands East Indies and I had
                        thought that settled the matter as among our four countries, since each
                        country unequivocally pledged itself to respect the <hi rend="italic">status
                            quo</hi>, but I added that notwithstanding the efforts of many of us to
                        maintain a thorough understanding with the Government of Japan, there was
                        continually coming out of Tokyo additional discussions of the Netherlands
                        East Indies as though the commitment to respect and preserve the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> had not been made. I said that these were
                        news reports and I myself was slow to accredit them, but that the tenor of
                        the reports interfered with the efforts of the Ambassador and myself and
                        others to preserve understanding and fair play and fair treatment between
                        our two countries by causing misunderstanding and increasing hostility on
                        the part of the people in each country. I said that I would make no
                        complaint now about the matter if that was a part of the newspaper policy in
                        Japan. I added finally that my Government strives for peace year in and year
                        out and it desires at all times to avoid controversy, and, therefore, if
                        controversy arises, the fault will not lie at the door of this Government. I
                        said further that in our constant desire and constant effort to promote and
                        preserve peace, both with other countries and among other countries, I hoped
                        that this attitude of ours would not be misunderstood.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador undertook in reply to disclaim any purpose of his Government
                        to send him to me to enter into the long examination to which he was
                        subjecting me when interrupted. He then repeated that his Government was
                        entirely satisfied with the situation following the reiteration of the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> in respect to the Netherlands Indies by
                        each of the four governments interested, and that it had no purpose to raise
                        any further controversy in that connection unless perchance the British or
                        French should land troops there to protect them. I remarked that, since my
                        Government was interested, I had made inquiries of the British and the
                        French, and gathered the unequivocal understanding that they had no idea
                        whatever to intervene in the Netherlands East Indies in any way.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then made some reference to the Monroe Doctrine in connection
                        with the West Indies situation, and I replied that I had seemingly in vain
                        sought to point out to his Government that, under <pb n="288"
                            xml:id="pg_288" facs="0354"/>the Monroe Doctrine, his country’s merchant
                        ships have equal access to every harbor in the Western Hemisphere (not
                        including a special arrangement between the United States and Cuba), while
                        under the policy which his Government is seeking to impose in the Pacific
                        Ocean area, the United States and other countries are to be denied equality
                        of trade and industrial opportunity in every Chinese port, and yet his
                        Government seems to look with complacency on this conflicting situation.</p>
                    <p>I again brought to his attention the information contained in the news ticker
                        report today from Tokyo, in which Japanese newspapers, as stated, were
                        undertaking to keep alive and emphasize some supposed special interests of
                        Japan in the Netherlands East Indies. I said it seemed very surprising to
                        observe that, after the Japanese Government had undertaken to spread itself
                        out over the huge republic of China, there was an intimation in the news
                        reports that it would not be content unless it extended itself three
                        thousand miles beyond to modestly take in the great archipelago comprising
                        the East Indies, presumably with a view of shutting out all equality of
                        trade opportunities among nations, while Japan would continue to demand
                        equality of trade opportunities in every other part of the world; that there
                        did not exist any selfish or other reason on the part of other nations to
                        interfere in the least with equality of trade opportunities on the part of
                        Japan. The Ambassador again stated that his Government was satisfied about
                        the Netherlands East Indies situation in the light of the renewed promises
                        of each of the three other governments interested, and that they had no
                        plans or purposes to proceed there to contact the Netherlands East Indies. I
                        expressed my satisfaction with his statement, but again reminded him of my
                        difficulty to understand the policy of the Japanese Government or the
                        Japanese press, whichever it was, to continue various lines of discussion
                        indicating a claim to some sort of special interest of Japan in the
                        Netherlands East Indies situation; that in a recent statement, I had set
                        forth rather comprehensively and succinctly the position of this Government
                        that the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> should be respected and preserved
                        by each of the four governments; that the real question presented actually
                        related to the entire Pacific area and that no further elaboration beyond my
                        recent statement on this subject would appear to add to anything I then
                        said.</p>
                    <p>I still interpret the Ambassador’s visit as one under instructions to develop
                        a pretext to support Japan in connection with its plans and purposes toward
                        the Netherlands East Indies.</p>

                        press by the Foreign Office for release in this morning’s papers: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Some time ago the Foreign Minister, Mr. Hachiro Arita, made a
                                statement that the Japanese Government, from the standpoint of
                                maintaining the peace and stability of East Asia, have deep concern
                                over any development that may affect the <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi> of the Netherlands East Indies. The said statement was
                                made with regard to various political, economic, and other matters.
                                Since that time our Government have continued negotiations with the
                                Netherlands Government concerning the questions of trade,
                                enterprises, entry of Japanese to the Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                            <p>As for the trade question, Japan is deeply interested in the
                                maintenance and further promotion of close commercial relations. An
                                amicable settlement of such a question is not only a demand
                                naturally arising from the relationship of administering to the
                                needs of each other but is an essential requirement in removing all
                                apprehensions, and in promoting friendly relations between Japan and
                                the Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                            <p>In view of this fact, the Japanese Government have as the first step
                                conducted negotiations with the Netherlands Government in order to
                                assure the exports to Japan of those commodities of the Netherlands
                                East Indies which are deemed essential to Japan. The Governments of
                                the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies have declared that
                                they would not take measures which would prevent such commodities as
                                mentioned above from being exported to Japan and that they would
                                comply with Japan’s desires. The Japanese Government appreciate this
                                sincere attitude.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government however are desirous that the Governments of
                                the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies actively take
                                appropriate measures in order to definitely assure the exports of
                                the desired quantities of required goods of the Netherlands East
                                Indies, and also dispose promptly [of] the questions regarding the
                                Japanese enterprises and entry of Japanese. In this connection the
                                Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Masayuki Tani, held
                                conversations today, June 28, with the Netherlands Minister, General
                                J. C. Pabst.”</p>

                    <p>293. News agencies have carried reports that Japan has made secret demands on
                        France regarding French Indochina. As reported, these <pb n="290"
                            xml:id="pg_290" facs="0356"/>demands include right on part of Japan to
                        move armed forces of Japan through that French possession, the right of
                        armed forces of Japan to use air bases at certain points there, etc.</p>
                    <p>The statements given by the Secretary of State to the press on April 17 and
                        May 11, 1940, set forth this Government’s belief that (1) intervention in
                        the domestic affairs of the Netherlands East Indies, or (2) any alteration,
                        by other than peaceful processes, in their <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                        would be prejudicial to the cause of security, stability, and peace in the
                        entire Pacific area, not just in the region in question. Also, there was set
                        forth the observation of the Government of the United States that the belief
                        restated in the preceding sentence was based on a doctrine of universal
                        application and that it is a doctrine unequivocally supported by this
                        Government. The same belief and the same observation naturally apply to
                        French Indochina likewise. This Government is seriously perturbed,
                        therefore, over the <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> which it is reported
                        that the Government of Japan has made to the French authorities.</p>
                    <p>If no objection is perceived, it is my desire that at your early convenience
                        you call upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that you express to him,
                        as under instruction from your Government and along the lines above
                        indicated, the concern felt by the Government of the United States regarding
                        the reported developments.</p>

                    <p>This afternoon I called on the Foreign Minister and after calling his
                        attention to the reports that France has received secret demands from Japan
                        in regard to Indochina, I addressed to the Minister the substance of
                        paragraph 2 of the Department’s telegram No. 293, August 6, 1 p.m., and
                        conveyed to him, as instructed, the concern with which the Government of the
                        United States regarded the developments reported.</p>
                    <p>In replying to my opening remarks, the Minister said that (1) he wished to
                        withhold his comment; (2) that admitting certain demands had been made on
                        Indochina, still he could not reveal their precise character; and (3) that
                        in regard to a recent article in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>,
                        a cabled report of which he had with him, he considered its various points
                        as either grossly exaggerated or completely unfounded. The Minister declined
                        to comment on the two demands listed in the Department’s telegram.</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0357"/>
                    <p>In departing, I presented the Minister with copies of the Secretary’s
                        statements of April 17 and May 11, and stressed the attitude of the American
                        Government towards maintaining the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> with
                        regard to the entire Pacific area, including both French Indochina and the
                        Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                    <p>I was told by the Minister and authorized to inform the Department in strict
                        confidence that the Japanese demands had been already accepted in principle
                        by the French Government.</p>
                    <p>An official of the Information Bureau, sent by the Foreign Minister, arrived
                        later in the afternoon with the message that it was the wish of the Japanese
                        Government not to disclose the object of my call and therefore the press
                        would be told that I had called about the Gendarmerie case in Shanghai.<note
                            n="6b" xml:id="d204fn6b">See telegram No. 671, July 22, 1940, 1 p.m.,
                            from the Consul at Shanghai, <ref target="#pg_101">p. 101</ref>.</note>
                        I sent back the reply that whereas I was convinced that the Department would
                        not betray any confidence, it might deem it necessary to release to the
                        American public that I had called in connection with alleged Japanese
                        demands concerning Indochina, and that hence it would be understood that in
                        no way could I have committed my Government on this point. Further, to say
                        that I had called in connection with the Shanghai Gendarmerie case would not
                        be true, and therefore I suggested that it be reported that I called for
                        “various routine matters”. The Foreign Office informed us, after further
                        telephone conversation that the press release would say that I had called to
                        inquire about press reports published abroad regarding late developments in
                        relations between French Indochina and Japan, and that the reports were
                        declared to be inaccurate by the Foreign Minister.</p>

                                has presented an ultimatum to the French authorities in Indochina

                                United States is reluctant to believe these reports, and it wishes
                                to point out the unfortunate effect on American public opinion from

                                authorities at Shanghai have put forward no new considerations in

                                the Shanghai Defense Committee, the Government of the United States
                                confidently hopes for prompt agreement by the Government of Japan to
                                a solution of the controversy along the lines of the Committee’s

                    <p>789. Department’s telegram No. 334, September 3, 6 p.m. Reference to
                        paragraph (1). As the Minister was temporarily ill, I approached the Vice
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon on the subject of French
                        Indochina in precise accord with your instructions.</p>
                    <p>The Vice Minister denied that he knew anything about an ultimatum, but he did
                        not deny that armed forces of Japan did intend to seek passage through
                        French Indochina. Ohashi said that the Japanese intention was a matter of
                        military necessity; that there would be no permanent occupation of French
                        territory; and that <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0359"/>Japan would
                        withdraw the forces in question as soon as the military necessity ceased to
                        exist. I spoke with emphasis on the attitude of the American Government;
                        likewise on Japan’s expressed attitude toward maintaining the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> in French Indochina, and on the deplorable
                        effect which the execution of the stated intention of Japan’s armed forces
                        would have on American public opinion.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after my interview with the Vice Minister, similar representations
                        were made by the British Ambassador, who received approximately the same
                        reply.</p>

                    <p>At the instance of the Foreign Minister, the Vice Minister asked me to call
                        this afternoon and handed to me a penciled “oral statement” in the Japanese
                        language in reply to my representations to the Foreign Minister on August 7
                        with regard to the reported Japanese demands on French Indochina. Mr. Ohashi
                        said that he wished to apologize for the delay; that the Minister after our
                        conversation on August 7 had directed that a reply be immediately formulated
                        and that it was due to the changes in Foreign Office personnel that this
                        reply had somehow disappeared and had only now come to light. The Vice
                        Minister’s attempt to summarize the Japanese text in English was so
                        inadequate that I said that I would prefer to study the text itself and to
                        submit it to my Government before venturing to comment. Our translation of
                        the statement follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“In a conversation on August 7, 1940, Your Excellency made reference
                                to newspaper reports to the effect that the Imperial Government had
                                at that time presented certain demands to the French Government
                                regarding French Indochina and said that the American Government was
                                concerned therewith. The Imperial Government, because of the
                                necessity to construct a new order in East Asia, had theretofore
                                carried out negotiations with regard to French Indochina, and on
                                that basis has continued progressively with satisfactory local
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>In settling the China Incident, Japan seeks the firm preservation of
                                a minimum right to existence; but in accomplishing this objective,
                                however, Japan has been avoiding conquests and exploitation, and has
                                been employing brotherly love, mutual existence and mutual
                                prosperity as guiding principles. Japan has, so far as it does not
                                interfere with the accomplishment of the above objective, been
                                making efforts not to bring about undesirable changes to the <hi

                            <p>Under the ever-changing conditions of today, past rules and norms
                                rapidly become inapplicable to actual conditions. It is clear that,

                                Despite the fact that in the western hemisphere epoch-making changes
                                are actually being made in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>,
                                Japan has as yet expressed no opinion for or against those changes.
                                It has to be pointed out that intrusion by the United States in an
                                area which is so remote from that country as in this case brings
                                about the same effect upon Japan’s public opinion as the meddlesome
                                attitude of a third country toward the policy of the United States
                                concerning third-power territories in the western hemisphere would
                                bring about upon public opinion in the United States.”</p>

                    <p>357. The Consul at Hanoi has informed the Department that the Japanese
                        commanding general has presented demands to the Governor General of
                        Indochina for occupation of Hanoi, Haiphong, and five airports by the armed
                        forces of Japan. According to Mr. Reed, General Nishihara has stipulated
                        that unless Japan’s demands are accepted, invasion of French Indochina by
                        Japanese armed forces will start on September 22 at 10 p.m.<note n="7b"

                        circumstances, among which is Japan’s voluntary pledge previously expressed

                        action giving rise to this report. You will also say that the Government of
                        the United States assumes that the report which it has received, if it is
                        based on fact, reflects action taken locally exceeding the instructions of
                        the Government of Japan, as was reputedly the case when a previous ultimatum
                        was presented by Japanese military authorities.</p>

                        represent the intentions neither of the Japanese military authorities at

                    <p>An appointment was made with Mr. Matsuoka on the afternoon of September 20,
                        after the Department’s telegram (357, September 19, 9 p.m.) had been
                        received and decoded, and I precisely acted upon the instructions of the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matsuoka in reply said that apart from some minor changes, the
                        particulars of which were not mentioned, the reports are correct that an
                        ultimatum had been presented to the Governor General of Indochina by General
                        Nishihara. The situation was then explained to be as follows, by the
                        Minister:</p>
                    <p>The French Ambassador, under instructions of the French Government, and the
                        Japanese Government on August 30 had signed an agreement in Tokyo.
                        Provisions of the agreement were <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> for the
                        movement of troops of Japan through Indochina and the use temporarily of
                        airports. The Governor General of Indochina was on September 6 ready to sign
                        an agreement which would have implemented the agreement signed in Tokyo on
                        August 30, but he refused for reasons not evident to the authorities of
                        Japan and obstructed the implementation of the agreement signed in Tokyo.
                        The Japanese Government felt obliged, although with reluctance, to ask the
                        French Government whether the actions of the Governor General were subject
                        to control by the French Government, since the Governor General continued to
                        be uncooperative, and whether on the basis of the agreement signed in Tokyo
                        the French Government was exhibiting good faith. The French Government said
                        that it was, and as evidently the Governor General was not acting in good
                        faith and as the Japanese authorities were aware that to foreign Consuls
                        stationed in Indochina the Governor had boasted that he was using
                        obstructive tactics, the Japanese ultimatum reported was necessarily
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the measures taken was, said the Minister, to enable the
                        Japanese forces to attack Chiang Kai-shek and to bring peace to China. As
                        soon as hostilities have ceased, he said, the Japanese forces would be
                        withdrawn at once; the integrity and sovereignty of Indochina would be
                        accorded full respect, and as a consequence there would be no interference
                        in East Asia with the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. The Minister said
                        that he, Prince Konoye, and other Government members were representative of
                        a minority opinion in Japan and that it was their determination that Japan
                        should not oppress, exploit or interfere with other countries’ integrity. He
                        said that a struggle was taking place against extreme elements within the
                        country on this issue. My interruption at this point was to the effect that
                        clauses pertaining to commerce and economics in Indochina were within the
                        scope of the agreement. No <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0362"/>denial
                        was made to my statement but I was assured that exploitation would not
                        ensue.</p>
                    <p>The terms of the agreement between France and Japan signed on August 30 were
                        confidential, said the Minister, and their divulgence by either of the
                        signatories would nullify them. He said he could confidentially tell me,
                        however, that France had broached the subject first and a request was made
                        for a renewal of guarantees pertaining to the integrity of Indochina based
                        on the agreement betweeen France and Japan which was negotiated at
                        approximately the same time as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was
                            concluded.<note n="8" xml:id="d209fn8">For text of the Anglo-Japanese

                            83.</note> He did not recall the exact date but said that the agreement
                        was in effect and registered with the League of Nations. (This presumably is

                                rend="smallcaps">c</hi>, p. 913.</note>) The Minister was
                        interrupted with my question as to what country’s encroachments France
                        desired guarantees against. Mr. Matsuoka said that this was a moot question.
                        He went on then to say that permission had been asked by Japan for the
                        movement of forces across Indochina and for the use temporarily of airports
                        as “compensation” for complying with the French request. This information
                        was given me in confidence, he emphasized, and its accuracy would of
                        necessity be denied in event of publicity.</p>
                    <p>The Minister talked lengthily, but in spite of this and his illogical
                        reasoning the meaning of his remarks is reported to the Department with all
                        possible precision. The Minister upon the conclusion of his remarks left at
                        once to fulfill another engagement and I could say only that if Japanese
                        troops moved into Indochina my Government would regard it emphatically as an
                        infringement of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> which the Japanese
                        Government had already pledged to preserve, and that a further statement of
                        the attitude of my Government was reserved until consideration had been
                        given to my report.</p>
                    <p>I presented to the Minister the substance of the Department’s 355, September
                        18, 6 p.m.,<note n="10" xml:id="d209fn10">Telegram not printed; see

                        <p>It is the opinion of my Government that the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi> of a third country is seriously affected when one of two
                            countries which is engaged in hostilities with another insists, in order
                            to attack the other, upon the right of the use of airdromes and the
                            right of passage for troops through the third country. In the light of
                            the Japanese Government’s announced desire that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >status quo</hi> be maintained in the Pacific area there appears to
                            be an inconsistency in connection with the stipulations of this nature
                            which are being made upon the authorities in Indochina by the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The American Government urges upon all governments the employment of
                            peaceful means only in their relations with all other governments and
                            with all other regions. The attitude of my Government toward the
                            unwarranted use of pressure in international relations is global.</p>

                    <p>In response to inquiries at the press conference today, the Secretary of

                        15, 1940, a statement marked “oral” in the sense of the Department’s
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Crocker requested that the statement be regarded as coming from me to the
                        Foreign Minister, and Mr. Terazaki accepted it with that understanding and
                        stated that he would see that it came promptly to the Minister’s hands.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the general conversation which ensued, Mr. Terazaki
                        expressed his concern at the present unfortunate trend in American-Japanese
                        relations and asked in all sincerity what Mr. Crocker thought could be done
                        to improve them. Mr. Crocker replied that Mr. Terazaki had before him in the
                        “oral” statement one of several hundred instances in which the Japanese
                        Government, if it sincerely valued American friendship, could take action to
                        put an end to the almost continuous interference with legitimate American
                        rights and interests in China and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>A copy of the “oral” statement under reference is enclosed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to invite the
                        attention of Your Excellency to the fact that on November 15 an oral
                        statement was left with Mr. Terazaki as from the American Ambassador to the
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that, according to information from the
                        American Consul at Hanoi, certain merchandise owned by American interests
                        was being refused re-export permits from Indochina by the Indochinese
                        authorities, chiefly as a result of Japanese pressure brought upon those
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>On November 30, in a conversation with Your Excellency, I made further
                        representations in this matter, repeating those made on November 15.</p>
                    <p>It was requested on both occasions that appropriate steps be taken to put an
                        end to this unwarranted interference with the shipments of goods and
                        merchandise owned by Americans.</p>
                    <p>I am constrained to observe to Your Excellency that, to date, there has been
                        no alleviation of this condition. In fact, it has been learned that, save
                        under certain special conditions which are <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300"
                            facs="0366"/>unnamed, no cargo can be re-exported from Indochina, and
                        there are indications that envisage either permitting cargo to be sold
                        locally by the owners or requisitioning such cargo as is needed for
                        Indochina. There is no guarantee that the proceeds of the sale or
                        requisition may be converted into foreign exchange and, in any event, the
                        foregoing practice would amount to a forced sale.</p>
                    <p>Acting under instructions from my Government, I have the honor emphatically
                        to protest this continued and unwarranted interference with the shipment of
                        goods and merchandise owned by Americans.</p>

                            a result of Japanese pressure brought upon those authorities, with the
                            shipments of American owned goods and merchandise, the American

                            of the Red Cross at present in Indochina, in addition to being
                            unwarranted on other grounds. At least a part of the Red Cross supplies
                            under reference, incidentally, was made possible by the contributions of
                            American citizens.</p>

                        Friendly Relations and the Mutual Respect of Each Other’s Territorial
                            Integrity,<note n="16" xml:id="d216fn16">Not printed.</note> as

                        1940. The treaty was signed at Tokyo on June 12, 1940, and ratified by the
                        Emperor on December 27, 1940.</p>
                    <p>A statement by the Information Board quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Tokyo
                            Nichi Nichi</hi> on December 25, 1940, declared: “The Treaty is one that
                        makes a valuable contribution toward the political progress of East Asia now
                        that Japan is devoting all her efforts to the establishment of a sphere of
                        common prosperity in Greater East Asia. In view of the fact that the Treaty
                        is not in its spirit and letter such a passive one as the so-called
                        non-aggression treaty, but a progressive one, it is clear that both Japan
                        and Thailand intend to make this treaty a basis of their friendly
                        relations.”</p>
                    <p>Although the language of this statement is somewhat obscure, it plainly
                        expresses the view that the treaty is calculated to assist Japan in its task
                        of establishing the New Order in East Asia, and the view that the new treaty
                        goes beyond the scope of the conventional non-aggression pact.</p>

                        were refused permission, by the French Indo-China authorities to re-export
                        certain merchandise belonging to them and <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302"

                        unwarranted interference.</p>
                    <p>The Imperial Government immediately instructed Japanese authorities in that
                        area to investigate the actual circumstances of the case, as a result of
                        which it was made clear that absolutely no unwarranted measures such as
                        those mentioned by the American authorities were taken. The Japanese
                        authorities interfere in no way whatsoever with the granting of permits by
                        the Indo-China Government for the export of articles the ownership of which
                        is determined to be American. As a matter of fact, for gasoline, permission
                        to export to Hongkong, Manila and other places has been granted at three
                        different times. Recently, on December 4, permission for the export to
                        Hongkong of 16,500 drums of gasoline was given to the Standard Oil Company
                        upon its request.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, recognized that there is much merchandise of this type which
                        is of uncertain ownership and it is obvious that Japanese authorities should
                        be able to seize or confiscate merchandise clearly determined to belong to

                        Accordingly, the attention of Your Excellency is hereby particularly called
                        to the fact that when American commercial firms intend to export
                        merchandise, they will be required to produce evidence that the ownership of
                        such merchandise is American.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to state that I have
                        carefully perused the contents of Your Excellency’s note No. 1732, January
                        24, 1941, reporting that the Government of the United States cannot admit
                        the right of the Imperial Army in French Indochina to engage in procedures
                        of confiscation, or to require evidence to be produced that merchandise to
                        be exported by an American firm is of American ownership, or to take similar
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese authorities, however, do not carry out indiscriminate
                        confiscation of all merchandise. Those authorities, with the understanding
                        of the authorities of French Indochina, seize or confiscate as enemy
                        property only merchandise the ownership of which rests clearly with the
                        Chiang Government. It is therefore natural that if a concerned party claims
                        the right of ownership, he should produce evidence of such ownership. If the
                        evidence is not produced, it must be regarded that the matter is left to the
                        Japanese authorities to be determined on the basis of their independent
                        examination.</p>
                    <p>I hereby have to inform Your Excellency not only that the Imperial Government
                        finds it difficult to regard the action taken by Japanese authorities in
                        French Indochina as an unjust one, but also that such action must be
                        regarded as a normal measure taken by the Japanese Army whose advance into
                        French Indochina was carried out as a strategical move against Chiang
                        Kai-shek and for the purpose of suppressing all activities aiding
                        Chiang.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: … I have the honor to report for the
                        Department’s information and record, the recent pronouncements made by
                        officials of the Japanese Government setting forth Japan’s present policy
                        regarding the Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                    <p>In his speech before the opening session of the Diet on January 21, the
                        Foreign Minister stated that the Netherlands East Indies “lay <pb n="304"
                            xml:id="pg_304" facs="0370"/>within the sphere of co-prosperity in
                        Greater East Asia”, and that “if only for geographical reasons, they should
                        be in intimate and inseparable relationship with our country.” In speaking
                        of the “Co-prosperity Sphere” itself he said that “it is our avowed purpose
                        to bring all the peoples in Greater East Asia to revert to their innate and
                        proper aspect, promoting conciliation and cooperation among them”; that
                        Japan is the leader in East Asia; and that “no other course is left to Japan
                        but … to secure an economic life of self-supply and self-sufficiency within
                        the region of Greater East Asia.”</p>
                    <p>There was promptly reported in Japan the official announcement issued by the
                        Netherlands East Indies Government with regard to its attitude concerning
                        Mr. Matsuoka’s pronouncement of Japan’s policy. An article which appeared in
                        the January 25, English-language issue of the <hi rend="italic">Tokyo Nichi
                            Nichi</hi>, quoting remarks attributed to Mr. Van Mook, Minister of
                        Economy of the Netherlands East Indies Government, in this respect, is
                        herewith enclosed.<note n="19" xml:id="d220fn19">Not printed.</note> The
                        press gave much attention to these remarks and in the Diet various
                        interpellations were made in the matter. Particular attention was directed
                        to the possibility of the successful conclusion of the economic negotiations
                        at Batavia in view of the attitude of the Netherlands authorities. In reply
                        to the interpellations, the Foreign Minister is reported to have stated that
                        it was the Government’s intent to continue the negotiations “to the last
                        moment.” He admitted that the negotiations were extremely difficult. He
                        stated that the Netherlands authorities were applying unnecessarily harsh
                        restrictions upon Japanese enterprises, trade, and emigrants; and that
                        Japan’s trade with the Indies was small because the Netherlands authorities
                        had been placing too many obstacles in Japan’s way. He declared, however,
                        that the decline in trade with Europe would favor the conclusion of an
                        agreement for an increase of the Indies trade with Japan, and in any event
                        he did not believe that the Netherlands authorities would refuse Japan’s
                        demands to the end.</p>
                    <p>In further remarks before the Diet, the Foreign Minister is reported to have
                        stated that the Japanese Government has never taken “an irresolute attitude”
                        towards the Netherlands East Indies Government, that Japan was determined to
                        advance its cause embodying “an endeavor to enable all peoples in the sphere
                        of Greater East Asia to enjoy prosperity in proportion to their respective
                        capacities.” There is enclosed a clipping of an article which appeared in
                        the January 30, 1941, English-language issue of the <hi rend="italic">Tokyo

                    <p>On January 31, the Netherlands Minister at Tokyo, upon instructions from his
                        Government, made a statement to the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs to the
                        effect that the Netherlands Government wished to make it clear that the
                        people of the Netherlands East Indies could not be expected either to let
                        their actions be guided by the conception of the “New Order” as set forth by
                        the Foreign Minister, or to acquiesce in the consequences of its eventual
                        application. On February 3, the Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information
                        Board referred to the Netherlands Minister’s statement describing it as a
                        declaration by the Netherlands Government in London to the effect that that
                        Government would not recognize inclusion of the Netherlands East Indies in
                        the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Spokesman announced that the
                        Japanese Government would not make any formal reply to the communication,
                        but that the Vice-Minister had informally told General Pabst that Japan
                        would adhere to its fixed policy and intended to continue the negotiations
                        at Batavia with the Netherlands East Indies authorities for economic
                        collaboration between that country and Japan. The Spokesman was reported as
                        stating further that Japan’s policy would not be affected by the Netherlands
                        Government’s declaration of which the Japanese Government could not take
                        serious notice; and that Japan is determined to realize concrete results
                        from the Batavia conference.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese press gave an appreciable amount of comment to the situation
                        between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies. It stressed the view that
                        cooperation of the Netherlands East Indies with Japan’s policy was
                        indispensable to Japan; that the Netherlands East Indies had shown an
                        unfriendly attitude towards this country; and made thinly veiled admonitions
                        to the effect that the Netherlands East Indies should consider the danger to
                        it of opposing its incorporation into the new “Co-prosperity Sphere”.</p>
                    <p>The agenda of the Japanese delegation to the economic conference at Batavia
                        was submitted to the Netherlands delegation in January. No publicity has
                        been given in Japan to the Japanese desiderata. The Embassy has been
                        informed by the Netherlands Legation here that although the tone of the
                        Japanese desiderata is friendly and non-aggressive, the demands themselves
                        are of such a nature that, if acceded to, the Netherlands East Indies would
                        be reduced to the status of a Japanese colony.</p>
                    <p>It is, of course, impossible to predict at this time the further development
                        of the situation between the two countries, but through these expressions of
                        view the general nature of the policies of the two countries and the
                        divergence between those policies have been made public and in effect placed
                        on record.</p>

                                Affairs</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Matsuoka</hi>), <hi rend="italic"
                                >Before the Japanese Diet, January 29, 1941</hi></head>
                        <p>Concerning the first point, although the interpellator apprehends that
                            the truce negotiations between Thailand and French Indo-China have not
                            made smooth progress, due to Anglo-United States maneuvers, I am
                            convinced that such apprehension is unwarranted.</p>
                        <p>Before Thailand and French Indo-China accepted Nippon’s offer of
                            mediation in their current dispute, certain powers had conducted
                            intensive operations behind the scenes.</p>
                        <p>Since the acceptance of Nippon’s offer, however, there have been no
                            indications of any maneuvers prejudicial to the peace between Thailand
                            and French Indo-China.</p>
                        <p>Our consultations with the two parties to the conflict so far have been
                            held secretly. Therefore, I cannot say anything on the matter today. No
                            agreement has yet been reached on the site of the truce negotiations. I
                            hope the consultations will be successfully concluded as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the second point in the interpellation, it is still premature
                            to reveal the amount of Nippon’s oil purchase from the Netherlands East
                            Indies. I hope that the time will soon come when the amount may be made
                            public, so as to reassure the people on the matter.</p>
                        <p>I apprehend, in this connection, that the contents of the negotiations
                            have already been partly disclosed secretly to some outside powers.
                            Nippon and the N. E. I. recently issued a general statement on the
                            matter. We have not yet reached agreement regarding a more precise
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>Before Commerce Minister Ichizo Kobayashi as Nippon’s trade delegate to
                            the N. E. I. left Batavia, an agreement was concluded on the oil
                            purchase, the most important item in his negotiations with the N. E. I.
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>As we had previously feared, the negotiations encountered difficulties.
                            Despite that, we succeeded in obtaining oil in a quantity surpassing our
                            original expectations. I expect that the purchase may be further
                            increased considerably in the form of ordinary commercial
                            transactions.</p>
                        <p>As regards the third point in the interpellation, my intention has
                            already been indicated in my speeches in the Diet. It seems difficult
                            for the peoples in Europe and America to understand the idea of “Hakko
                            Ichiu”. I know that it is difficult to interpret the Nipponese phrase in
                            foreign languages. Although the peoples in Europe and <pb n="307"
                                xml:id="pg_307" facs="0373"/>America have not yet understood the
                            mission of the Nippon nation, we must continue our efforts to make them
                            understand it. Because of their failure to understand the Nipponese
                            idea, they raise objections thereto.</p>
                        <p>I take this opportunity to state that the Imperial Government has never
                            taken an irresolute attitude. We are firmly determined to advance our
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>The construction of the East Asia common prosperity sphere is regarded
                            with misgivings by those nations misinterpreting Nippon’s aspirations as
                            a desire for the conquest of Greater East Asia. Such misunderstanding is
                            the product of modern Occidental civilization.</p>
                        <p>For those nations prosecuting their policies with the use of force along
                            the lines of conquest of foreign territories, it may be difficult to
                            understand our racial idea. Because our intention is misunderstood, I
                            take this occasion to clarify it.</p>
                        <p>The word “leadership” may sound unpleasant to some persons. However,
                            logically speaking, it is right and proper for the Nipponese to attempt
                            to lead Greater East Asia in accordance with the idea of “Hakko Ichiu”
                            which represents our traditional racial aspiration.</p>
                        <p>We will endeavor so as to enable all the peoples in the sphere of Greater
                            East Asia to enjoy prosperity in proportion to their respective
                            capacities.</p>
                        <p>I earnestly desire that Nippon’s leadership will be accepted without any
                            prejudice by the peoples in the region and other nations in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Our intention is to develop our traditional racial principle in a manner
                            covering not only Greater East Asia but also all other regions in the
                            world. As the first step in our efforts in that direction, it is planned
                            to lead the peoples in the sphere of Greater East Asia in accordance
                            with the idea of “Hakko Ichiu”. I desire that all the nations and
                            peoples in the sphere will cooperate in the prosecution of our holy
                            mission after fully understanding the Nippon cause. Nippon will never
                            refuse to collaborate with those nations in Europe and America
                            sympathizing with Nippon’s aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the fourth point in the interpellation, I regret that Nippon
                            residents in the N. E. I. have been subjected to outrages in that
                            country. We are determined to put forth our best efforts for remedying
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>Because we are conducting economic negotiations with the N. E. I., the
                            Government has taken a calm attitude toward the incidents, requesting
                            the N. E. I. to rectify the situation in accordance with our
                            protests.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the N. E. I. press has taken an unfriendly attitude to
                            Nippon. As this is highly regrettable, we have striven to enlighten the
                            press regarding the cause of friendship between the two countries.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Your
                        Excellency’s note no. 3, South Seas II, dated January 7, 1941, in response
                        to my oral representations on November 15, 1940, and my note no. 1714 of
                        December 17, 1940, to Your Excellency concerning interference by Japanese
                        officials in Indo-China with the issuance of permits by the authorities of
                        French Indo-China for the export of American-owned merchandise from that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>I regret to have to inform Your Excellency that further reports received by
                        my Government indicate that the actions of the Japanese officials in
                        question are at variance with the statement contained in Your Excellency’s
                        note under reference to the effect that “Japanese authorities interfere in
                        no way whatever with the granting of permits by the Indo-China Government
                        for the export of articles the ownership of which is determined to be
                        American.”</p>
                    <p>According to recent information received by my Government not only do
                        Japanese officials in Indo-China continue to interfere with the granting of
                        permits by appropriate authorities of Indo-China for the re-export of
                        American-owned merchandise, but in one instance at least have caused these
                        authorities to revoke a valid permit previously issued for the re-export of
                        petroleum products owned by an American firm, the Standard Vacuum Oil
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the foregoing, I am instructed by my Government to urge that
                        Your Excellency take without delay the necessary measures to bring about the
                        cessation of this unwarranted interference on the part of the Japanese
                        officials in Indo-China with the movement of American-owned merchandise.</p>

                    <p>317. In the course of my conversation today with the Foreign Minister he went
                        out of his way to accuse the British Government of taking measures in the
                        Far East which were a direct incitement to Japan and which rendered very
                        difficult an improvement in the situation. He referred in this connection to
                        the reported mining of Singapore and the sending of Australian troops to the
                        Malaya-Thailand border.</p>
                    <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0375"/>
                    <p>I said that it seemed to me extraordinary that the Japanese should interpret
                        and characterize obviously defensive measures as measures of offense. As I
                        had said to the Minister at the American-Japan Society luncheon,<note n="21"
                            xml:id="d222fn21">See <ref target="#pg_129">p. 129</ref>.</note> we must
                        inevitably be guided by “facts and actions” and that certainly the facts and
                        actions relating to Japan’s southward advance were concrete causes for
                        serious anxiety not only on the part of Great Britain but of ourselves.
                        Having occupied in succession Waichow, Hainan, the Spratly Islands, and
                        other areas, the Japanese military were now pouring troops into Indo-China
                        and, according to our informer, had occupied the airport in Saigon, quite
                        apart from naval activities in those regions, and that these steps, taken in
                        conjunction with the public utterances of many Japanese statesmen, generals
                        and admirals concerning Japanese intentions to the southward, had created a
                        situation which could hardly be regarded with equanimity either by the
                        United States or Great Britain since they threatened not only our interests
                        but our possessions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matsuoka replied that Japan was not the only country where inflammatory
                        utterances occurred and in this connection he mentioned the names of certain
                        Americans. He denied the truth of the report that the airfield at Saigon had
                        been occupied, merely murmuring something about Tongking, and he said that
                        the Japanese troops in Indo-China were there in strict accordance with the
                        terms of the official agreement with the Vichy Government. I said that
                        according to our own information these troops were very much in excess of
                        the number originally stipulated, but the Minister replied that this was
                        merely a question of replacement.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned into other channels.</p>
                    <p>Sent to the Department. Repeated to Hong Kong. Hong Kong please repeat to

                            printed.</note> The Minister for Foreign Affairs called me on the
                        telephone this morning and expressed surprise and annoyance at an editorial
                        published today in the <hi rend="italic">Japan Times and Advertiser</hi>
                        quoting him as having stated in reply to an interpellation in the Budget
                        Committee of the Diet with regard to Japan’s policy toward Oceania that “we
                        have a natural right to settle <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0376"/>in
                        the region. White men occupying Oceania are due to return it to the
                        Asiatics.” The Minister said to me that the interpolator, who spoke three
                        times as long as he himself had spoken, had used vehement and heated
                        language and that he, Mr. Matsuoka, had endeavored to temper the exchange of
                        views.</p>
                    <p>(Having drafted the rest of the Minister’s remarks as made to me over the
                        telephone I took the precaution of asking Dooman<note n="23a"
                            xml:id="d223fn23a">Eugene H. Dooman, Counselor of Embassy in
                            Japan.</note> to call on the Minister at his private residence “it being
                        Sunday” and to ask if he desired to corrector to amplify my draft. Mr.
                        Matsuoka said that my draft correctly reported what he had said by telephone
                        but that he would prefer, since I had given him the opportunity, to set
                        forth precisely what he had actually said to the Diet. The rest of this
                        telegram is therefore in the Minister’s own handwriting.)</p>
                    <p>The Minister’s thesis was that the Japanese people as well as other Asiatics
                        have the natural right to go and settle anywhere in the world.</p>
                    <p>As for instance, there are the United States and like countries, whose
                        conditions, climatically and otherwise, are very favorable and we’d prefer
                        to go and settle. However, that was only theory and as a matter of practical
                        international politics, there is no use contending about it. We Asiatics are
                        shut door to almost every where. Oceania, 1100 miles north to south, 1000
                        east to west, was about the only region left. Climatically and otherwise the
                        region is not preferable, but it is not with us Asiatics, including
                        Japanese, a question of obtaining a better living but a question of
                        struggling for mere subsistence. Where may we go? Even of unfavorable
                        tropical and semi-tropical [climate]—the region pointed out is about the
                        only place for us left, and it should be open as field for future expansion
                        of the Asiatics. In winding up his reply the Minister hoped that the white
                        people would agree to his views as set forth. What he pleaded for was merely
                        open door for Asiatics’ immigration and enterprises, and he uttered no word

                        possessions should be renounced. Those views represent the Minister’s
                        studied thought over a period of 30 years and Mr. Matsuoka adds that the
                        same views have been set forth in a book by a prominent American bishop in
                            Shanghai,<note n="24" xml:id="d223fn24">See James W. Bashford, <hi

                    <p>220. Department has received following information from Embassy in
                        Berlin:</p>
                    <p>Circles usually well informed have reported that during Matsuoka’s recent
                        visit in German capital, one of the subjects he discussed was that of
                        Germany’s supplying war planes to Japan at once. Japanese request is said to
                        have been assented to by German Government on condition that Germany be
                        furnished with shipments of necessary raw materials from Dutch East Indies
                        as compensation. In this connection there is another report that several
                        Government officials who are currently informed on Dutch affairs are in near
                        readiness to leave for Japan.</p>

                    <p>562. Having in mind the rumors prevailing in Tokyo, which have been reported
                        previously, of an intention on the part of Japan to attack Singapore very
                        soon, a member of the Embassy staff made a point of mentioning these reports
                        to Ohashi<note n="25" xml:id="d225fn25">Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> at a luncheon on April 15. While very vigorously denying
                        these reports, Ohashi said that an official denial would be issued if the
                        question were raised with the Cabinet Information Board by an American
                        correspondent. On the afternoon of April 15, the deputy spokesman for the
                        Cabinet Information Board (Ishii) declared officially that these reports
                        were untrue, in response to an inquiry from an American correspondent. Ishii
                        said, as Prince Konoye had stated recently, the intentions of Japan in
                        regard to the southern area are altogether economic and peaceful. Ishii
                        declared that he could deny flatly and absolutely that Japan has any
                        intention of sending a naval or a military force against or to Singapore and
                        he characterized the reports as the work of warmongers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: With reference to the several formal
                        and informal representations which I have made to Your Excellency concerning
                        certain American-owned cargo in French Indo-China, I have the honor to bring
                        to Your Excellency’s attention the fact that the Japanese military
                        authorities in that area, apparently acting on instructions from their
                        Government, have recently commenced removing the cargo to transports for
                        shipment elsewhere. As much of this cargo is of American origin, is owned by
                        American nationals, and as the Government of the United States has extended
                        considerable credits thereon, I have been instructed by my Government to
                        protest against this arbitrary action and to request that the American cargo
                        be returned to its rightful owners immediately.</p>
                    <p>According to information received from the American Consul at Hanoi, American
                        firms which had cargo stored in Haiphong received communications on May 24
                        from the Japanese military authorities demanding the keys to the warehouses
                        in which the cargo was stored. The following day, May 25, before the
                        American firms had reached any decision with reference to this demand, the
                        Japanese prevailed on the French authorities to demand of the American firms
                        the surrender of the keys. In the face of this official demand in writing
                        from the duly constituted French authorities, the American firms were forced
                        under protest to relinquish their keys, which in turn were given by the
                        French authorities to the Japanese. As a matter of fact, it is understood
                        that Japanese soldiers broke into certain warehouses even before the keys
                        were handed over.</p>
                    <p>The American Consul at Hanoi has lodged a protest with his Japanese colleague
                        with reference to this action of the Japanese military.</p>
                    <p>I have been instructed to inform Your Excellency that the Government of the
                        United States does not recognize any right on the part of the Japanese
                        military in French Indo-China to take the action described above, and that
                        it reserves all rights in regard to property involved in which it or its
                        nationals may have interest. Although my Government does not have full
                        details in regard to all the merchandise involved, it does have a definite
                        interest in much of it because of its American origin and because of
                        American Governmental credits extended thereon. I am further instructed to
                        inform Your Excellency that my Government has an interest in the unimpeded
                        delivery of this cargo to such destination as may be desired by its lawful
                        owners. <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0379"/>Accordingly, it is
                        requested that the cargo be released without delay to the companies which
                        hold title to it.</p>

                    <p>The American Embassy presents its compliments to the Imperial Japanese
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has the honor to refer to the American
                        Ambassador’s note to the Imperial Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, No.
                        1812 of June 3, 1941, and to the Ambassador’s remarks to His Excellency the
                        Minister on June 5, concerning the seizure at Haiphong, French Indo-China,
                        of American-owned merchandise by Japanese military forces.</p>
                    <p>According to information recently received from the American Consul at Hanoi,
                        who visited Haiphong in connection with the seizure, accurate information
                        concerning the amount of cargo seized is not available because the owners
                        thereof are prevented by the Japanese military from inspecting the docks and
                        warehouses where operations are going on. The representatives of the various
                        American companies at Haiphong were accordingly unable to ascertain exactly
                        the amount and nature of their transit cargo which had been seized, although
                        they knew that a certain amount had been taken away.</p>
                    <p>The American Consul at Hanoi further stated that the Japanese Military
                        Mission at Haiphong had been supplied, through a French liaison officer,
                        with lists of cargoes which were American-owned or in which there was an
                        American interest.</p>
                    <p>In transmitting the above information to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
                        American Embassy has the honor to reiterate the request contained in the
                        American Ambassador’s note mentioned above, that immediate steps be taken to
                        return the seized American cargoes to those companies which have titles
                        thereto.</p>

                        carefully perused the contents of Your Excellency’s note no. 1812, June 3,
                        1941.</p>
                    <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0380"/>
                    <p>Your Excellency is hereby referred to the matters stated in my note no.
                        14–Confidential/–South Seas II, February 8, 1941, and in Your Excellency’s
                        note no. 1732, January 24, 1941.</p>
                    <p>The accumulated goods in question are goods which have been kept in custody
                        by the authorities of French Indo-China under the observation of the
                        Japanese. The authorities of French Indo-China in June 1940 prohibited the
                        transit through that country of materials for the assistance of Chiang, and
                        accordingly recognized the despatch of a Japanese military Special Committee
                        to see that the prohibition was carried out. In this manner they wholly
                        cooperated with Japan in its efforts to suppress activities of assistance to
                        Chiang, as a result of which, materials consigned to Chiang which were in
                        French Indo-China at the time have not, as a rule, been permitted to be
                        transported out of that country.</p>
                    <p>It being natural to regard military materials consigned to the Chungking
                        régime, with which Japan is at present engaged in hostilities, as having a
                        hostile nature, it is also beyond question that this cannot be affected by
                        the place of origin of the goods, or by the presence or absence of credits
                        or other arrangements for the payment of their cost. Furthermore, since the
                        goods are hostile in nature, it is natural for the Japanese to dispose of
                        them as enemy property. The Japanese authorities, however, being anxious to
                        avoid violating the interests of third power nationals, have up to today
                        been making every effort to ascertain in each case whether there was any
                        evidence to disprove the presumption mentioned above; and when as a result
                        thereof there was conclusive proof with respect to any goods, their
                        transportation outside French Indo-China was recognized as appropriate. Thus
                        a very careful attitude has been maintained in dealing with the matter.
                        However, in the meantime, Chungking has on more than one occasion attempted
                        to transport these goods secretly, and it became difficult, under prevailing
                        conditions, to be assured of the safe protection of the accumulated goods
                        while preventing their flow to Chungking. Therefore, it became necessary to
                        transport to other places of safety for the time being those goods which, as
                        a result of the investigations of the Japanese authorities, were determined
                        positively to be enemy property, as well as those goods which, for the
                        reasons mentioned above, were deemed to be enemy property in the absence of
                        evidence to the contrary.</p>
                    <p>It is, accordingly, regretted that at this juncture Your Excellency was not
                        agreeable, as mentioned in Your Excellency’s note referred to above, to
                        cooperate with the Japanese authorities on the ground that there was no
                        obligation on the part of Your Excellency’s nationals to produce evidence

                    <p>However, it may be added that the Japanese authorities are prepared to save
                        those goods, even after they have been transported elsewhere, concerning
                        which evidence is produced that they belong to third powers or to third
                        power nationals.</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the frequent oral and written communications between the
                        American Embassy and the Foreign Office concerning merchandise in French
                        Indo-China owned by American citizens or in which there is American
                        interest; the latest of these communications was the Foreign Minister’s Note
                        no. 71 dated June 24, 1941.</p>
                    <p>Since that time, information has been received to the effect that certain
                        cargo at Hanoi as well as at Haiphong has been seized by the Japanese
                        military, but that it was impossible to check the amount and nature of the
                        cargo so seized because the rightful owners were not permitted to inspect
                        the warehouses where their merchandise was stored. Nevertheless, it is known
                        that a substantial amount of American cargo has been taken away.</p>
                    <p>In bringing this subject again to the attention of the Foreign Office, it is
                        urgently requested that immediate steps be taken to restore the merchandise
                        to its rightful owners. The Government of the United States, as has been
                        stated before, does not recognize the right of the Japanese military to take
                        any action whatsoever in French Indochina against property in which there is
                        an American interest. The American Embassy has been instructed to state that
                        the result of persistence by the Japanese in action such as that described
                        above can only be further deterioration in relations between the United
                        States and Japan.</p>

                            24, 1941</hi></head>
                    <p>In response to inquiries by press correspondents, the Acting Secretary made
                        the following statement:</p>
                    <p>“It will be recalled that in 1940 the Japanese Government gave expression on
                        several occasions to its desire that conditions of disturbance should not
                        spread to the region of the Pacific, with special references to the
                        Netherlands East Indies and French Indochina. This desire was expressly
                        concurred in by many other <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0382"
                        />Governments, including the Government of the United States. In statements
                        by this Government, it was made clear that any alteration in the existing
                        status of such areas by other than peaceful processes could not but be
                        prejudicial to the security and peace of the entire Pacific area and that
                        this conclusion was based on a doctrine which has universal application.</p>
                    <p>“On September 23, 1940, referring to the events then rapidly happening in the
                        Indochina situation, the Secretary of State stated that it seemed obvious
                        that the existing situation was being upset and that the changes were being
                        achieved under duress. Present developments relating to Indochina provide
                        clear indication that further changes are now being effected under
                        duress.</p>
                    <p>“The present unfortunate situation in which the French Government of Vichy
                        and the French Government of Indochina find themselves is, of course, well
                        known. It is only too clear that they are in no position to resist the
                        pressure exercised upon them.</p>
                    <p>“There is no doubt as to the attitude of the Government and people of the
                        United States toward acts of aggression carried out by use or threat of
                        armed force. That attitude has been made abundantly clear.</p>
                    <p>“By the course which it has followed and is following in regard to Indochina,
                        the Japanese Government is giving clear indication, that it is determined to
                        pursue an objective of expansion by force or threat of force.</p>
                    <p>“There is not apparent to the Government of the United States any valid
                        ground upon which the Japanese Government would be warranted in occupying
                        Indochina or establishing bases in that area as measures of
                        self-defense.</p>
                    <p>“There is not the slightest ground for belief on the part of even the most
                        credulous that the Governments of the United States, of Great Britain, or of
                        the Netherlands have any territorial ambitions in Indochina or have been
                        planning any moves which could have been regarded as threats to Japan. This
                        Government can, therefore, only conclude that the action of Japan is
                        undertaken because of the estimated value to Japan of bases in that region
                        primarily for purposes of further and more obvious movements of conquest in
                        adjacent areas.</p>
                    <p>“In the light of previous developments, steps such as are now being taken by
                        the Government of Japan endanger the peaceful use by peaceful nations of the
                        Pacific. They tend to jeopardize the procurement by the United States of
                        essential materials such as tin and rubber which are necessary for the
                        normal economy of this country and the consummation of our defense program.
                        The purchase of tin, rubber, oil or other raw materials in the Pacific area
                        on equal terms <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0383"/>with other nations
                        requiring these materials has never been denied to Japan. The steps which
                        the Japanese Government has taken also endanger the safety of other areas of
                        the Pacific, including the Philippine Islands.</p>
                    <p>“The Government and people of this country fully realize that such
                        developments bear directly upon the vital problem of our national
                        security.”</p>

                    <p>At the request of the new Minister for Foreign Affairs I called on him for a
                        second interview at 9:30 this evening. He said that at noon tomorrow the
                        Japanese Government would issue an official statement of the agreement
                        reached with the Vichy Government concerning Japan’s proposed movement into
                        Indochina but that in view of the concern of the United States he wished to
                        explain to me in advance the reasons and intentions of such movement.
                        Admiral Toyoda thereupon handed to me a document in Japanese accompanied by
                        an unofficial English translation the text of which was transmitted to the
                        Department in the Embassy’s telegram No. 1088, July 26, 2 a.m.<note n="26"

                            Japanese document is printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note></p>
                    <p>After reading the document I said that I would transmit it promptly to my
                        Government but that in the meantime I could best reply to certain points
                        contained therein by conveying to the Minister the statement issued to the
                        press by the Acting Secretary of State yesterday. I thereupon read to the
                        Minister such portions of the Acting Secretary’s statement as were picked up
                        on the radio today and said that I would send to him tomorrow the complete
                        text when finally received tonight.</p>
                    <p>In further discussion I emphasized and elaborated certain pertinent points in
                        Mr. Welles’ statement. I spoke of the utter fallacy of the charge of
                        “encirclement” and of the concept that Japan was acting for the “safety and
                        protection of Indochina”. I said that I was glad to take note of the phrase
                        in the Japanese statement that “Japan has no intention at all of making the
                        southern part of Indochina a base of armed advancement against adjoining
                        areas” but that my Government and I myself had met with so many bitter
                        disappointments during the past several years in the illusory nature of
                        promises and assurances conveyed to me by former Japanese Ministers that we
                        were now unavoidably obliged to rely on facts and actions rather than upon
                        words. The Minister did not attempt to refute this statement but he
                        earnestly begged me to believe him.</p>
                    <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0384"/>
                    <p>As the conversation continued I spoke in detail of the successive steps of
                        the Japanese southward advance culminating for the present in the proposed
                        occupation of bases in southern Indochina and the consequent endangering of
                        the safety of other areas in the Pacific including the Philippine Islands
                        and I elaborated the practical and logical reasons for our concern in the
                        safety of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies which were definitely
                        threatened by this advance.</p>
                    <p>The Minister did not try to refute my argument except to repeat the peaceful
                        intentions of the proposed Japanese move into Indochina and to take issue
                        with our use of the term “occupation” in connection therewith since Japan
                        had no territorial ambitions. I replied that the term “occupation” connoted
                        no question of time.</p>
                    <p>In closing our conversation the Minister earnestly appealed to me to use my
                        best efforts to convey to my Government Japan’s peaceful intentions and the
                        great importance of avoiding at this critical moment measures which would
                        provoke the Japanese people and render difficult the efforts to improve the
                        relations between Japan and the United States. He said that he would convey
                        to Admiral Nomura the substance of our conversation.</p>

                    <p>Between the Japanese Government and the Vichy Government there was amicably
                        reached an agreement of views on the twenty-first of July, 1941, concerning
                        the joint protection of French Indochina, and an announcement on the
                        agreement is soon to be made.</p>
                    <p>I asked for an appointment with Your Excellency this evening in order to take
                        this opportunity, on behalf of the Japanese Government, of informing Your
                        Excellency in advance of the measure just referred to, and of making the
                        situation clear so that there may be no unnecessary misunderstanding which
                        may arise from this question, in view of the foreign press reporting
                        unfounded rumors such as that the Japanese Government had sent the Vichy
                        Government an ultimatum.</p>
                    <p>The relations between Japan and French Indochina have recently become more
                        friendly by the so-called Matsuoka-Henri Pact of August, last year, and
                        several other Franco-Japanese agreements; and in view of the fact that it is
                        to the common interest of both Japan <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0385"
                        />and France to insure the safety of French Indochina and to prevent the
                        disturbance of peace in the same area under the existing complicated
                        international situation, the Japanese and French Governments have, at this
                        time, as already stated, arrived at an understanding as regards joint
                        protection of French Indochina.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to say that I can affirm to Your Excellency that the Japanese
                        Government will strictly observe all the agreements now existing between
                        Japan and France and especially those relating to the integrity of territory
                        and the respect for sovereignty and refrain from interfering in the domestic
                        affairs of French Indochina, and also that Japan has no intention at all of
                        making the southern part of French Indochina a base of armed advancement
                        against adjoining areas.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, we are receiving numerous reports that America should
                        adopt more stringent anti-Japanese economic measures such as the freezing of
                        Japanese capital in America and a complete embargo of petroleum oil as
                        retaliatory steps against the measure just mentioned; and if the above
                        should ever be realized, I deeply apprehend that it will be difficult to
                        prevent the unexpected agitation of antagonism among the Japanese people
                        against aid to the Chiang Kai-shek regime and the encirclement campaign
                        against Japan, which antagonism the government has so carefully repressed
                        until today.</p>
                    <p>It seems that in the United States there is an element which possesses an
                        unpleasant feeling against the measure which I have just mentioned, but
                        viewing it in a fair and composed attitude from an objective standpoint,
                        such a measure is truly unavoidable from a broad viewpoint of maintaining
                        peace in the Pacific by preventing a more serious aggravation of the
                        feelings of the Japanese people, which are steadily being excited by such
                        facts as the unsatisfactory result of the Netherlands East Indies-Japanese
                        negotiations, and as is well known, the almost daily reports from abroad
                        about the tightening of the encirclement campaign against Japan. I earnestly
                        hope that Your Excellency will fully comprehend the disposal at issue as
                        being necessitated by sincere hope for the maintenance of the peace in the
                        Pacific and cooperate in keeping the door open for my hope and further
                        efforts directed toward amicable solution of Japanese-American
                        relations.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister, called this afternoon at 3:15 at his
                        request. He said that he had been instructed by the Ambassador to leave with
                        me as an advance copy a statement which was <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320"
                            facs="0386"/>to be released by the Japanese Government at 10 p.m.,

                        situation. Mr. Wakasugi said that he had been instructed, in leaving this
                        statement with me, to call special attention to two points: (1) that in what
                        the Japanese Government was doing the Japanese Government would show respect
                        for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of French Indochina; and
                        (2) that Japan did not intend to interfere with the internal affairs of
                        French Indochina.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wakasugi asked that I inform the Acting Secretary of the foregoing.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I would bring the matter to the attention of the Acting
                        Secretary. I added that the attitude of this Government had of course, as
                        Mr. Wakasugi was aware, been made known clearly by the President<note

                    <p>In recent times through successive Franco-Japanese agreements, beginning with
                        the Matsuoka-Henri Agreement of August, 1940, the relations between Japan
                        and French Indo-China have grown rapidly intimate. The Governments of Japan
                        and France have now reached a complete agreement of views on the joint
                        defense of French Indo-China under a friendly policy.</p>
                    <p>While observing strictly all her obligations arising from the existing
                        agreements, especially her solemn pledge to respect the sovereignty and the
                        territorial integrity of French [Indo-]China, Japan will hereafter strive
                        more than ever to promote the friendly relations between Japan and France
                        and thereby to bring about the common prosperity of the two countries.</p>

                    <p>The Acting Secretary of State, Mr. Sumner Welles, issued the following
                        statement on August 2 in reply to inquiries from the press <pb n="321"
                            xml:id="pg_321" facs="0387"/>concerning the agreement entered into
                        between the French and Japanese Governments regarding French Indochina:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The French Government at Vichy has given repeated assurances to the
                                Government of the United States that it would not cooperate with the
                                Axis powers beyond the obligations imposed on it by the armistice,
                                and that it would defend the territory under its control against any
                                aggressive action on the part of third powers.</p>
                            <p>“This Government has now received information of the terms of the
                                agreement between the French and Japanese Governments covering the
                                so-called ‘common defense’ of French Indochina. In effect, this
                                agreement virtually turns over to Japan an important part of the
                                French Empire.</p>
                            <p>“Effort has been made to justify this agreement on the ground that
                                Japanese ‘assistance’ is needed because of some menace to the
                                territorial integrity of French Indochina by other powers. The
                                Government of the United States is unable to accept this
                                explanation. As I stated on July 24, there is no question of any
                                threat to French Indochina, unless it lies in the expansionist aims
                                of the Japanese Government.</p>
                            <p>“The turning over of bases for military operations and of territorial
                                rights under pretext of ‘common defense’ to a power whose
                                territorial aspirations are apparent, here presents a situation
                                which has a direct bearing upon the vital problem of American
                                security. For reasons which are beyond the scope of any known
                                agreement, France has now decided to permit foreign troops to enter
                                an integral part of its Empire, to occupy bases therein, and to
                                prepare operations within French territory which may be directed
                                against other peoples friendly to the people of France.</p>
                            <p>“The French Government at Vichy has repeatedly declared its
                                determination to resist all encroachments upon the sovereignty of
                                its territories. However, when German and Italian forces availed
                                themselves of certain facilities in Syria to carry on operations
                                directed against the British, the French Government, although this
                                was a plain encroachment on territory under French control, did not
                                resist. But when the British undertook defense operations in the
                                territory of Syria, the French Government did resist.</p>
                            <p>“Under these circumstances, this Government is impelled to question
                                whether the French Government at Vichy in fact proposes to maintain
                                its declared policy to preserve for the French people the
                                territories both at home and abroad which have long been under
                                French sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>“This Government, mindful of its traditional friendship for France,
                                has deeply sympathized with the desire of the French people to
                                maintain their territories and to preserve them intact. In its
                                relations with the French Government at Vichy and with the local
                                French authorities in French territories, the United States will be
                                governed by the manifest effectiveness with which those authorities
                                endeavor to protect these territories from domination and control by
                                those powers which are seeking to extend their rule by force and
                                conquest, or by the threat thereof.”</p>

                    <p>1542. From a non-Japanese source of the highest authority the Embassy has
                        been informed as follows in regard to the attitude and behavior of Japan’s
                        armed forces in French Indochina: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The Japanese military command presented a number of demands to the
                                Governor General about 10 days ago, asking that certain airfields in
                                Cambodia and French military barracks in various parts of Indochina
                                be transferred to Japanese armed forces. A number of Chinese,
                                alleged to be secret agents of Chinese Government, have also been
                                arrested by the Japanese. The military accompanied their demands for
                                the transfer of airfields and barracks by a threat to take
                                possession of them forcibly if the French authorities failed to
                                return a favorable reply before September 27, noon. Vigorous
                                representations regarding the matter were made by the French Embassy
                                here. Officials of the Japanese Foreign Office emphasized that
                                although the attitude of the Japanese military authorities in French
                                Indochina was not approved by the Government, the latter was not in
                                a position to intervene. In view of the Japanese Government’s wholly
                                negative attitude, the Governor General of Indochina replied
                                affirmatively to the Japanese military command before expiration of
                                the time limit stated.</item>

                        <p>As the year 1941 opened, a vast movement of political forces throughout
                            the world was intensely active. The Axis grouping among Germany, Italy
                            and Japan had been formalized in September 1940 by the conclusion of the
                            Tripartite Pact.<note n="1" xml:id="d237fn1">See <ref target="#pg_164"
                                    >pp. 164</ref> ff.</note> The anti-Axis grouping was not
                            organized. In all countries not at the moment engaged in the hostilities
                            in Europe, there was great rivalry and struggle between opposing groups
                            which in some countries sought to escape, if possible, involvement in
                            that war and which in other countries sought to cast their national
                            fortunes with one side or the other of the conflict in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union was not at that time actively engaged in the European
                            war on either side. It had, on August 23, 1939, concluded a
                            non-aggression pact with Germany and, on the basis of an exchange of
                            letters between the respective Foreign Ministers on September 28, 1939,
                            had subsequently entered into close economic relations with Germany,
                            whereby in addition to a substantial exchange of supplies carried on
                            between Germany and the Soviet Union there was a considerable transit
                            trade both ways through Russian territory between Germany and the Far
                            East. In this transit trade supplies destined for Germany were assembled
                            by a large German purchasing organization functioning throughout the Far
                            East with at least benevolent Japanese acquiescence. Despite these
                            political and economic arrangements, basic elements of enmity on the
                            part of Germany toward the Soviet Union remained unaffected.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union was also talking with Japan. A political treaty to ease
                            tension between those countries had long been under negotiation and was
                            still under consideration. Russian railways continued carrying German
                            machines and supplies to Manchuria—much of this <pb n="326"
                                xml:id="pg_326" facs="0392"/>cargo being en route to Japan—and
                            Manchurian and Japanese products to Germany.</p>
                        <p>Italy was suffering severe military losses in Albania and Libya. Germany
                            was vigorously engaged in preparing for a new offensive. These
                            preparations were partly devoted to intensive political and diplomatic
                            activity in the Balkans. Bulgaria and Rumania were brought into the Nazi
                            fold. Germany’s efforts to increase its influence in Turkey and
                            particularly in Japan continued at an accelerating pace.</p>
                        <p>Germany’s vast military machine, which included powerful land and air
                            forces built up over a period of years, was intact after riding
                            rough-shod over the greater part of the continent of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The entire Japanese nation was aware of what its leaders called a “golden
                            opportunity” (resulting from inadequate preparation for defense,
                            confusion and preoccupation on the part of the western “democracies”
                            with the war in Europe and with domestic issues) to fulfill the nation’s
                            desire for expansion. Japan was however, faced with a great internal
                            struggle in regard to methods for taking advantage of the opportunities
                            presented—some groups were insisting that Japan keep out of the war in
                            Europe and gather all possible benefits obtainable by trade and by
                            negotiations and threats short of participation in that war; other
                            groups were determined to strike with force if necessary even at the
                            risk of throwing together the war in China and the war in Europe. The
                            Japanese people were psychologically tired after three and one-half
                            years of war in China. They were being continually told that the
                            Japanese Cabinet had as its primary objective the termination of the
                            “China incident” and the prevention of the spread of the European war to
                            the Far East. Despite diplomatic conversations with Russia, large
                            Japanese forces were maintained in Manchuria. Long lines of
                            communication made further penetration into China by Japanese forces
                            costly. Japan was also faced by growing American aid to China. (On
                            November 30, 1940 it was announced at Washington that the Export-Import
                            Bank would loan $50,000,000 to the Chinese Government and that a fund of
                            $50,000,000 to stabilize Chinese currency was under contemplation.)
                            Although Japan’s long efforts had succeeded in rationalizing Japan’s
                            heavy industry and in expanding tremendously the output of munitions,
                            Japan’s economy was feeling the pinch of restrictions on exports from
                            the United States and other countries. By the early part of 1941,
                            shipments from the United States to Japan of iron, steel, most important
                            metals, machinery, high quality gasoline and blending agents, and plants
                            and plans for the production of high quality gasoline had practically
                            ceased. The tension between the United States and Japan was growing and
                            was affording fuel to the arguments between opposing groups in Japan.
                            Japanese diplomats were beginning attempts to follow in <pb n="327"
                                xml:id="pg_327" facs="0393"/>the Far East Germany’s pattern in the
                            Balkans and to “Bulgarize” Indochina, Thailand, and the Netherlands East
                            Indies.</p>
                        <p>The British Empire was desperately engaged in efforts (political,
                            diplomatic, and military) to prepare to meet new military offensives
                            which threatened to break out in any one or several of a number of areas
                            stretching from the British Isles around the world to Australia. At the
                            same time the British Empire was struggling with the momentous problem
                            of bringing to maximum effectiveness its organization of a war economy
                            and expansion of war industries while Great Britain was digging out of
                            the wreckage of German bombing raids on British cities.</p>
                        <p>China, weakened by the ravages of three and one-half years of military
                            invasion and depredation, was continuing heroically to hold off Japan.
                            China however was confronted with mounting problems of supply and the
                            difficulties of growing inflation. China had been robbed of its great
                            cities and cut off from all normal communication routes with the rest of
                            the world. The prospects of additional aid from Russia were not
                            encouraging, and, after the Japanese move into northern Indochina in the
                            summer of 1940, the Burma Road remained practically the only route
                            available for bringing in sea-borne supplies (except for a precarious
                            smuggling traffic between the occupied and unoccupied areas of China).
                            The amounts of supplies which could be transported by the Burma Road
                            were limited. Moreover, the Burma Road was exposed to Japanese air
                            attack, and there was also the danger that in case Germany should break
                            through in the Near East Japan might take advantage of the situation to
                            advance southward to make contact with the Germans by way of the Indian
                            Ocean and to close the Burma route into China altogether.</p>
                        <p>The Netherlands East Indies were feeling increasing pressure from
                            Japanese diplomacy to force the Indies to “cooperate” with Japan as
                            Indochina, following negotiations between Japan and Vichy, had agreed to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>The potential threat from Japan which had continued to grow was forcing
                            all other powers interested in the Pacific to undertake to whatever
                            degree possible reinforcement of their defensive strength in that area.
                            The Netherlands, British Malaya, Burma, India, Australia, New Zealand
                            and the United States, all were feeling keenly the need for more
                            airplanes, more ships, more guns, more ammunition and more of every kind
                            of supplies necessary for defense. The vast scope of this need, combined
                            with other factors, made it necessary to spread dangerously thin the
                            military forces and supplies which those countries were able to provide
                            or obtain. At the same time the heavy need for supplies for Great
                            Britain, for Near Eastern and Mediterranean areas, and for countries of
                            this hemisphere, continued <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0394"/>to
                            place greater demands upon the industrial facilities of the United
                            States than could then be met.</p>
                        <p>The world picture at the opening of 1941 would not be complete without
                            reference to the theater of war in the north Atlantic, where the Germans
                            with a large fleet of submarines and long-range bombers were taking a
                            toll of ships and materials which at the moment were almost impossible
                            to replace. There was at that time a noticeable inadequacy of available
                            shipping to bridge the gap between American factories and the European
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Another of the important factors in the situation was the information
                            which early in 1941 had come to the knowledge of the Government from
                            reliable and confidential sources that Germany had decided to attack
                            Russia. This Government communicated this information confidentially to
                            the Soviet Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The United States had passed through a Presidential election in
                            connection with which both of the great political parties wrote into
                            their respective platforms unequivocal resolutions against involving the
                            United States in foreign wars. The nation was only beginning to put into
                            effect an expanding program of national defense and of aid to the
                            democracies. Industrial plants were continuing to make peacetime goods,
                            although construction of new defense industries and expansion of
                            existing defense plants were under way. Labor disputes were on the
                            increase. The problem of national security, however, was beginning to
                            emerge as a major preoccupation of the United States and there were
                            signs of a growing feeling that our security was inseparable from the
                            security of all free peoples.</p>
                        <p>The acuteness of the situation in Europe, the constantly growing danger
                            in the Far East, the vast expanse of territory to be defended, the
                            necessity of supplying materials for defense of this hemisphere, of the
                            British Isles, of the Near East and of the Far East, the need for
                            expanding tremendously our output of materials necessary for defense for
                            ourselves and for our friends, the generally divided attitude of the
                            American public toward the world situation, the inadequacy of American
                            production, and growing realization of the far-reaching consequences to
                            the whole world which would follow the extension of the European war and
                            of the hostilities in China to the entire Pacific area and of the
                            importance of averting if possible such a development—all these
                            constituted significant and inescapable factors in the situation which
                            confronted the United States in January 1941.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Preliminary Phase</hi></p>
                        <p>1. Late in January 1941, through the medium of private Americans and
                            Japanese, there was informally brought to the attention of the President
                            and the Secretary of State a suggestion that the Japanese Government
                            would welcome an opportunity to alter its <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329"
                                facs="0395"/>political alignments and modify its attitude toward
                            China. It was represented that if an agreement could be achieved with
                            the United States which would offer Japan security this would enable the
                            moderate elements in Japan to gain control of the domestic political
                            situation in Japan. It was further represented that there was adequate
                            support in the Japanese Government for an agreement with the United
                            States which would provide <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> for
                            practical nullification of Japan’s alliance with the Axis and for a
                            settlement of the conflict between China and Japan on terms which would
                            give complete recognition by Japan of the “open door” in China provided
                            that Japan received similar treatment elsewhere in the Far East. It was
                            also represented that the Japanese people were weary of the hostilities
                            with China and that most elements in Japan were prepared for a recasting
                            of Japan’s policies along liberal and peaceful lines.</p>
                        <p>2. Under any circumstances it would have been necessary before
                            entertaining representations of such a character to proceed with caution
                            and to examine with deliberate care the sponsorship and contents of a
                            proposal advanced in this way. Such a procedure was at that time
                            especially essential in view of Japan’s record during the preceding ten
                            years. In connection with this record, it will be recalled that on
                            January 15, 1941, the Secretary of State, in a statement before the
                            Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, said: <quote

                                    name of ‘Manchukuo’. This control over Manchuria has been marked
                                    by the carrying out of a policy of discrimination which has
                                    resulted in forcing out American and other foreign

                                    of more than a million men occupied large areas along the

                                    in a dominant position in the entire region of the Western
                                    Pacific. Her leaders have openly declared their determination to
                                    achieve and maintain that position by force of arms and thus to
                                    make themselves masters of an area containing almost one-half of
                                    the entire population of the world. As a consequence, they would
                                    have arbitrary control of the sea and trade routes in that
                                    region.</p>
                                <p>“Previous experience and current developments indicate that the
                                    proposed ‘new order’ in the Pacific area means, politically,
                                    domination by one country. It means, economically, employment of
                                    the resources of the area concerned for the benefit of that
                                    country and to the ultimate impoverishment of other parts of the
                                    area and exclusion of the interests of other countries. It
                                    means, socially, the destruction of personal liberties and the

                                    persuade the Japanese Government that her best interests lie in
                                    the development of friendly relations with the United States and

                        <p>3. The trend of contemporary developments in the Far East was such as to
                            discourage belief that the time was opportune for acting upon the
                            suggestion which had been brought to the attention of this Government.
                            For example, in his address before the Japanese Diet on January 21, Mr.
                            Matsuoka, Minister for Foreign Affairs, made clear, in effect, that he
                            sought from the United States realization of the vital concern to Japan
                            of the establishment of an East Asia “co-prosperity sphere”, assent to
                            Japan’s supremacy in the western Pacific, and cessation of economic
                            restrictions against Japan. He and other Japanese spokesmen were to an
                            increasing extent openly stressing the point that the Tripartite
                            Alliance was the pivot of Japan’s foreign policy. Other evidence of
                            growing Japanese intransigence was discernible in their increasing
                            pressure upon Indochina to grant Japan military and naval bases and
                            other new privileges, and in reports of extensive political intrigue by
                            Japanese agents in Thailand. In the light of this situation and of
                            Japan’s long previous record of aggression, the initial reaction in this
                            Government to the suggestion that the Japanese Government would welcome
                            an opportunity to alter its political alignments and modify its attitude
                            toward China was one of caution. At the same time, the sponsors of the
                            suggestion insistently represented that the proposal <pb n="331"
                                xml:id="pg_331" facs="0397"/>was acceptable to high Japanese
                            official circles and could be made effective in Japan.</p>
                        <p>It was felt that before coming to any decision regarding the approach
                            which had been made it would be desirable to await the arrival of the
                            new Japanese Ambassador, Admiral Nomura. He presented his credentials to
                            the President on February 14, and on March 8 the Secretary of State had
                            his first extended conversation with the Ambassador. On that occasion
                            the Secretary pointed out that the efforts of this Government to bring
                            about organization of the world along liberal commercial lines had been
                            impeded by movements of military conquest in various parts of the world
                            and—having in mind press reports that had contained hints—he expressed
                            the hope that the Ambassador might have something definite in mind that
                            would offer a practical approach to dealing with the present course of
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his wholehearted approval of this Government’s
                            efforts to liberalize international commercial relations and affirmed
                            the desire of the Japanese Government to reach a peaceful settlement
                            with China and to reestablish friendly relations with the United States.
                            He offered no concrete suggestions for dealing with the Chinese question
                            or for conducting discussions with this Government in regard to matters
                            calling for settlement. Nor did he indicate what his Government was
                            prepared to do to clarify its attitude toward the Tripartite Alliance to
                            which the Secretary called attention. With regard to his Government’s
                            present course he said he had nothing to offer other than to disclaim
                            that Japan was committed to courses of conquest.</p>
                        <p>4. On April 9 there was received by the Secretary of State from the
                            private persons referred to above a document containing a draft of a
                            proposal for a general settlement in the Pacific area. This proposal,
                            although reflecting an attitude less liberal in some respects than the
                            earlier representations had forecast, contained many suggestions with
                            which this Government could readily agree and other suggestions which
                            would require modification or elimination to meet this Government’s
                            point of view. On April 14 the Secretary, in a conversation with the
                            Japanese Ambassador, referred to reports which had been coming to the
                            Secretary that certain Japanese had been formulating proposals for
                            improving relations between the United States and Japan and that the
                            Ambassador had been participating in the formulating of those proposals,
                            and said that he did not know whether those reports were accurate but
                            that it would of course be understood that in considering problems
                            outstanding between our two Governments we could deal only with the
                            Ambassador. The Ambassador promptly replied that he had known about the
                                <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0398"/>proposals in question and
                            stated that he had collaborated in the later stages of their
                            preparation. He emphasized his desire to preserve peace between the two
                            countries and his belief that his Government did not intend to invade
                            the southwest Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>5. On April 16 the Secretary of State, in a further conversation with the
                            Japanese Ambassador, after referring to the proposals of April 9, said
                            that the one paramount preliminary question about which this Government
                            was concerned was a definite assurance in advance that the Japanese
                            Government had the willingness and power to go forward along the lines
                            of the proposal, to abandon its present doctrine of conquest by force,
                            and to adopt four principles which this Government regarded as the
                            foundation upon which relations between nations should rest and which
                            the Secretary of State enumerated as follows: <list>

                        <p>The Secretary of State expressed to the Japanese Ambassador the
                            willingness of this Government to consider any proposal which the
                            Japanese Government might offer such as would be consistent with the
                            principles which the Secretary of State had enumerated. He also
                            expressed the view that if the Japanese Government should earnestly
                            intend to change its course there should be no reason why a reasonably
                            satisfactory settlement of the problems presented might not be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>During this conversation the Ambassador replied to the effect that he
                            believed that his Government desired peace, that he wished to discuss
                            the questions raised by the Secretary of State, and that he would
                            proceed to consult his Government in regard to the four points which the
                            Secretary of State had laid before him.</p>

                        <p>6. The presentation on May 12 by the Japanese Ambassador, as under
                            instruction from his Government, of a document containing a proposal for
                            a general setttlement between the two Governments served to reveal
                            authoritatively for the first time what the Japanese Government had in
                            mind as a basis for an agreement. The Ambassador <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0399"/>introduced at this time as his
                            associates Colonel Hideo Iwakuro, a representative of the Japanese Army,
                            and Mr. Tadao Wikawa, an officer of the Cooperative Bank of Japan, who
                            was spoken of as being close to the most influential civilian group in
                            the Japanese Government. These two advisers took part in the subsequent
                            conversations until those conversations were interrupted in July.</p>
                        <p>The document which the Japanese Ambassador presented on May 12 appeared
                            to carry out a concept of a joint overlordship by Japan and the United
                            States of the Pacific area, with apparently little thought for the
                            rights and interests of countries other than Japan and the United
                            States. The first two sections of the document, which were introductory
                            and general in character, contained affirmations in abstract terms of
                            peaceful intent and of a purpose to promote international cooperation.
                            In reference to Japan’s position with regard to its alliance with the
                            Axis, the proposal contained a statement, which, in no way indicating
                            any purpose on Japan’s part of loosening its ties with the Axis, was a
                            restatement of Japan’s previously proclaimed position that its alliance
                            with the Axis powers was designed to prevent the nations which were not
                            then directly affected by the European war from engaging in that war
                            (thus clearly implying a concept of coercing the United States for Axis
                            purposes).</p>
                        <p>The proposal also included an undertaking on the part of the United
                            States to request that the Government of China negotiate with Japan a
                            settlement of the hostilities in China; a mutual undertaking by the
                            United States and Japan that each would supply so far as possible
                            commodities which the other required; a mutual undertaking that steps
                            would be taken to bring about resumption of normal trade relations
                            between the United States and Japan; and an undertaking by the United
                            States that, Japan’s expansion in the southwestern Pacific being
                            declared to be of a peaceful nature, the United States would cooperate
                            in facilitating the production and procurement by Japan of natural
                            resources (such as oil, rubber, tin, and nickel) which Japan needed. In
                            connection with the undertaking on the part of the United States to
                            request that China negotiate with Japan it was explained separately by
                            the Japanese that the United States would be expected also to agree to
                            discontinue aid to the National Government of the Republic of China in
                            case the latter should decline to enter into such negotiations. The
                            terms which Japan intended to propose to China were indicated only
                            through reference to the “Konoe principles”. <quote rend="blockquote">

                            which had placed Japan clearly in a position of overlordship with
                            respect to the Wang régime, the Secretary of State sought to induce the
                            Japanese to state precisely the terms which they had in mind as a basis
                            of Japan’s negotiations with China, but the Japanese Ambassador and his
                            associates consistently avoided making definite commitments by constant
                            resort to vague generalities. (In the course of conversations with
                            officers of the Department, the special military adviser of the Japanese
                            Ambassador explained that the areas where stationing of Japanese troops
                            in China was contemplated under the provision for “defense against
                            communistic activities through collaboration of the two countries [China
                            and Japan]” included Inner Mongolia and the adjacent regions of China
                            proper, comprehending lines of communication to the sea as far south as
                            Tsingtao, which thus meant Japanese military domination of the five
                            northern provinces of Hopei, Shantung, Shansi, Chahar and Suiyuan with
                            an aggregate area of more than 400,000 square miles and an estimated
                            population of more than 80,000,000. The military adviser declared that
                            this stationing of Japanese troops in China was an absolute condition of
                            any settlement with China.)</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the features in the Japanese draft above noted which
                            presented difficulties for this Government, the Japanese proposal
                            appeared to offer possibilities as a basis for informal and exploratory
                            discussions looking to a broad-gauge settlement of Pacific problems
                            along the lines envisaged by this Government. Moreover, many highly
                            placed Japanese, including the Prime Minister, in conversations with the
                            American Ambassador at Tokyo, professed a belief that Japan’s best
                            interests lay in adopting courses of peace and of cooperation with this
                            country. It was represented that an agreement with the United States
                            would give such a psychological “lift” to the Japanese people that there
                            would be an assurance of popular support in Japan of programs of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>7. This Government’s attitude toward these representations was influenced
                            by considerations of the world situation, as already summarized in the
                            opening pages of this review, and of the defensive strategical position
                            of this country and other similarly-minded countries. Great Britain,
                            hard pressed by Germany, was in need of all the assistance <pb n="335"
                                xml:id="pg_335" facs="0401"/>that the United States could render in
                            the Atlantic and Near Eastern theaters of war. With Great Britain and
                            the United States thus preoccupied, and with the Netherlands Indies,
                            Australia, and other British territories in East Asia, including Malaya,
                            Burma, and North Borneo, extremely vulnerable to Japanese attack, it was
                            obviously desirable to avert, or at least to delay as long as possible,
                            any Japanese move which would result in a war on two oceans. It was of
                            course realized that Japanese armed attack on British and Dutch
                            territories in the Far East would immediately and tremendously increase
                            the problems confronting the British, the Dutch, the Chinese and
                            ourselves. In fact, the British, the Australian, and the Netherlands
                            Governments continued to urge upon this Government their unpreparedness
                            for resisting successfully a Japanese thrust in the Pacific. This
                            Government was impressed not only by these representations but also by
                            the consideration that the hope of defeating Hitlerism in Europe would
                            be greatly enhanced if the more conservative elements in Japan should
                            succeed in what was represented as their effort to divert Japan from
                            courses of conquest and to cause Japan to withdraw—even though
                            gradually—from the Axis camp and align itself with the United States.
                            Accordingly, this Government decided to explore thoroughly every
                            possible means, starting with the Japanese proposals, of coming to an
                            agreement. In reaching this decision this Government, while realizing
                            that the prospects of success were slender, was actuated by a sincere
                            desire to reach an agreement if possible and thus act in accordance with
                            the traditional desire of the American people that all peaceful means
                            for settling differences be employed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State on numerous occasions emphasized to the Japanese
                            Ambassador that this Government was aware of the difficult internal
                            situation which the Japanese Government faced and was prepared to be
                            patient and to give the Japanese Government ample time to bring Japanese
                            public opinion into line in support of a liberal broad-gauge program
                            such as the Secretary of State and the Japanese Ambassador had been
                            discussing in their conversations. The Secretary of State realized
                            thoroughly that Japan’s record since 1931 made it clear that there was
                            only a slight chance that Japan would or could change its course so as
                            to make possible an agreement. After weighing all factors in the world
                            situation, however, it seemed wise fully to explore that chance, at the
                            same time adhering firmly to the attitude which this Government was
                            taking of opposition to the course of aggression which Japan was
                            pursuing.</p>
                        <p>8. On May 20, 1941, in a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador and
                            his associates, the Secretary of State stated that there were two points
                            in regard to the section of the Japanese proposal dealing with China to
                            which he would like to call attention. One was in <pb n="336"
                                xml:id="pg_336" facs="0402"/>regard to the joint defense against
                            communism and the other was in regard to the stationing of Japanese
                            troops in certain parts of Chinese territory. He said that he was not
                            discussing the merits of the two points to which he referred but he felt
                            that if and when this Government should approach Generalissimo Chiang
                            Kai-shek on the matter of negotiating with Japan the Secretary of State
                            would have to tell Generalissimo Chiang the basis on which Japan would
                            propose to negotiate; and that this basis should be one on which
                            Generalissimo Chiang could carry his country with him. He therefore
                            wished to ask whether it would not be possible to cover these two points
                            under some broader provision, such as a provision which would call for
                            special measures of protection for Japanese nationals and property
                            interests against lawlessness in areas where special measures for
                            safeguarding the rights and interests of nationals of third powers might
                            be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese in reply expressed surprise that these points should have
                            been mentioned in as much as they regarded the settlement of the China
                            affair as a matter which concerned only China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State pointed out in this and other conversations that a
                            peaceful settlement between Japan and China was an essential element in
                            furthering the objective which the United States and Japan had in mind,
                            namely, the peace of the Pacific. He added that if the United States
                            should suggest that China enter into negotiations with Japan this
                            Government could not divest itself of a certain degree of responsibility
                            with regard to the basis of the proposed negotiations and the general
                            conformity of Japan’s proposed terms with principles which this
                            Government supports.</p>
                        <p>9. On May 28 in response to questions asked by the Secretary of State,
                            the Japanese Ambassador indicated that withdrawal of Japanese troops
                            from China would not include Japanese troops retained in China for
                            “cooperative defense against Communism”, and that he was unable to state
                            how many troops Japan would propose retaining or to define the precise
                            areas in which the troops would be stationed. The Secretary thereupon
                            commented that it seemed to him important that relations between China
                            and Japan should be adjusted on a basis which would offer permanent
                            promise of friendship between the two countries; and that the continued
                            presence of Japanese troops in China would be a factor operating against
                            such friendship. He asked whether the Japanese Government would not
                            consider some other means of dealing with the problem than by
                            arrangements such as Japan appeared to be contemplating. The Japanese
                            Ambassador said that he did not believe that the Far East had progressed
                            to a point where other arrangements would be feasible.</p>
                        <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>In this conversation of May 28, the Secretary of State mentioned that in
                            connection with the question of a possible approach by this Government
                            to the Chinese Government he had it in mind, before entering into any
                            negotiations with Japan, to talk out in strict confidence with the
                            Chinese Government the general subject matter involved in the proposals
                            under discussion. He added that in the meantime conversations between
                            the United States and Japan would continue on a purely informal and
                            exploratory basis. This Government’s attitude in regard to this subject
                            was repeatedly presented to the Japanese Government on subsequent
                            occasions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State also on May 28 made it clear that the Japanese
                            proposed formula with reference to Japanese relations to the Axis did
                            not adequately clarify Japan’s peaceful intention toward the United
                            States should the United States through acts of self-defense become
                            involved in war with Germany. He emphasized that such clarification was
                            needed especially to offset statements being made by Japanese officials
                            in defense or justification of Japan’s Axis obligations. He said that
                            the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Matsuoka, since his return from
                            Europe, had, according to widely published press reports, been making
                            declarations on all occasions in regard to Japan’s obligation under the
                            Tripartite Alliance to support Germany in the event of American entry
                            into the war in Europe. He said that, if we made an agreement with
                            Japan, critics would, unless the Japanese Government had clarified its
                            attitude toward its obligations under the Tripartite Alliance, assert
                            that there was no assurance as to Japan’s position vis-à-vis the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>10. In a conversation on June 2 the Secretary of State asked the Japanese
                            Ambassador whether Japan seriously and earnestly desired to enter into a
                            settlement for peace and non-discriminatory commercial relations and
                            friendship in the Pacific area. When the Ambassador replied in the
                            affirmative, the Secretary remarked that, in the light of the statements
                            which Mr. Matsuoka and others were constantly making, one was forced to
                            inquire whether Japan really was seeking this sort of settlement or was
                            only seeking a way to extricate itself from the hostilities with China
                            while otherwise going forward with methods and practices entirely
                            contrary to the principles which would have to underlie any settlement
                            establishing peace, non-discriminatory treatment of commerce and fair
                            and friendly relations in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador reiterated his view that a fair settlement was desired. In
                            reply to an inquiry from the Secretary of State about the Japanese
                            policy with regard to the stationing of troops in China indefinitely,
                            the Ambassador offered no encouraging comment.</p>
                        <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0404"/>
                        <p>The question of what Japan meant by “economic cooperation” between China
                            and Japan was also discussed. Japan at first disclaimed any intention to
                            maintain for itself an economic monopoly in China, but as the informal
                            conversations proceeded it was evident that Japan intended to retain a
                            preferred economic position for itself in China while at the same time
                            trying to obtain for itself in the southwestern Pacific area economic
                            rights such as it was unwilling that third powers should enjoy in China.
                            The Secretary of State made it clear that retention by Japan of a
                            preferred position in China would be inconsistent with the principle of
                            non-discrimination in international commercial relations to which this
                            Government was committed, which it believed to be essential for a
                            lasting peace in the Pacific, and which the Japanese had said they
                            approved.</p>
                        <p>11. Throughout the conversations this Government’s attitude was
                            repeatedly set forth with regard to these points—the necessity of
                            Japan’s making clear its relation to the Axis in case the United States
                            should be involved in self-defense in the war in Europe; application of
                            the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another
                            country and withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory;
                            application of the principle of non-discrimination in commercial
                            relations in China and other areas of the Pacific; and assurance of
                            Japan’s peaceful intent in the Pacific. The Secretary of State
                            emphasized that what he was seeking was a comprehensive agreement which
                            would speak for itself as an instrument of peace and that he was not
                            interested in an agreement of a temporizing character which would not
                            contain promise for future stability along sound progressive lines.</p>
                        <p>12. Following a conference on June 4 between officers of the Department
                            and associates of the Japanese Ambassador which revealed on the part of
                            Japan an even more grudging attitude than had heretofore been manifested
                            toward clear-cut commitments on courses of peace, the Secretary of State
                            on June 6 informed the Japanese Ambassador that he had received an
                            impression, from the successive Japanese revisions of their proposal and
                            from recent manifestations of the Japanese Government’s attitude, that
                            the Japanese Government was disposed (1) to stress Japan’s alignment
                            with the Axis; (2) to avoid giving a clear indication of an intention to
                            place Japan’s relations with China on a basis which, in the opinion of
                            the Government of the United States, would contribute to a lasting peace
                            and thus to future stability in the Far East; and (3) to veer away from
                            clear-cut commitments in regard to policies of peace and of
                            nondiscriminatory treatment which were the fundamentals of a sound basis
                            for peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>13. The Japanese Ambassador continued to insist that the Japanese
                            Government really desired peace and kept urging the Secretary of <pb
                                n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0405"/>State to make a complete reply
                            to the Japanese proposals of May 12. Consequently, on June 21, the
                            Secretary handed the Ambassador a document which would, he explained,
                            serve to bring the current discussions up to date as regarded the
                            American attitude. This draft of June 21 included the following
                            important points: <list>

                        <p>14. In the period immediately following June 21 several discussions were
                            held by the Secretary of State or other officials of this Government
                            with the Japanese representatives. The Japanese representatives, while
                            indicating that they were seeking to meet the point of view of the
                            United States upon certain issues, did not indicate a willingness,
                            either through accepting this Government’s formulas or otherwise, to
                            alter in any substantial manner the attitude to which they had
                            previously given expression upon the main questions.</p>
                        <p>Following an Imperial Conference at Tokyo on July 2, in which, according
                            to an official announcement, “the fundamental national policy to be
                            taken toward the present situation was decided” Japan proceeded with
                            military preparations on a vast scale, including the calling up of from
                            one to two million reservists and conscripts. Japanese merchant vessels
                            operating in the Atlantic Ocean were suddenly recalled, a step which an
                            important maritime nation such as Japan would not be likely to take
                            without exceptionally strong <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0406"
                            />reasons. Restrictions were imposed upon travel in Japan, strict
                            censorship of mails and communications was carried out. Conditions
                            approaching those usual only in anticipation of embarking upon a major
                            war were imposed throughout the Empire.</p>
                        <p>During this period the Japanese press dwelt constantly on the theme that
                            Japan was being faced with pressure directed against it never equalled
                            in all Japanese history. It charged the United States with an intention
                            to establish military bases in Kamchatka and with using the Philippine
                            Islands as a “pistol aimed at Japan’s heart”. It warned that if the
                            United States took further action in the direction of encircling Japan,
                            Japanese-American relations would face a final crisis. (Later, on August
                            8 and again on August 15, an official Japanese spokesman declared that
                            encirclement of Japan by the ABCD powers—the United States, Great
                            Britain, China and the Netherlands—was an actual fact. The Japanese
                            press, while affirming its approval of efforts by the Japanese
                            Government to improve relations with the United States, stressed that
                            the basis for any negotiations must be predicated upon there being under
                            no circumstances any change in Japan’s policies, namely, the “settlement
                            of the China Incident, the firm establishment of the Co-Prosperity
                            Sphere, and the Axis Alliance”.)</p>
                        <p>15. In July this Government began receiving reports that a Japanese
                            military movement into southern Indochina was imminent. This Government
                            brought these reports to the attention of the Japanese representatives,
                            pointed out the inconsistency between such a military movement and the
                            discussions which were then proceeding looking toward the conclusion of
                            an agreement for peace in the Pacific, and requested information as to
                            the facts of the situation.</p>
                        <p>On July 23, the Japanese Ambassador, apparently after having received
                            instructions from his Government, stated in explanation of the Japanese
                            movement into southern as well as northern Indochina first that Japan
                            feared that vital supplies including rice, foodstuffs and raw materials
                            from Indochina might be cut off by de Gaullist French agents and Chinese
                            agitators in southern Indochina,<note n="*" xml:id="d237fn13">In an oral
                                statement, however, given by the Japanese Foreign Minister to
                                Ambassador Grew later, on August 18, the stationing of Japanese
                                troops in Indochina was stated to be a measure adopted for the
                                purpose of bringing to an end the hostilities in China.</note> and
                            second that Japan believed that certain foreign powers were determined
                            to encircle Japan militarily and that for that reason occupation of
                            southern Indochina was undertaken purely as a precautionary measure. The
                            Acting Secretary replied that any agreement which might have been
                            concluded between the French Government at Vichy and Japan could only
                            have resulted from pressure exerted on Vichy by Germany; therefore, it
                            was our judgment that this agreement <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341"
                                facs="0407"/>could only be looked upon as offering assistance to
                            Germany’s policy of world domination and conquest. He pointed out that
                            the conclusion of the agreement which had been under discussion by the
                            Secretary of State and the Ambassador would bring about a far greater
                            measure of economic security to Japan than she could gain by occupation
                            of Indochina. He said further that the policy of the United States was
                            the opposite of an encirclement policy or of any policy which would be a
                            threat to Japan; that Japan was not menaced by the policy of Great
                            Britain and if an agreement had been concluded, Great Britain, the
                            British Dominions, China, and the Netherlands would have joined the
                            United States and Japan in support of the underlying principles stood
                            for by the United States; that the United States could only regard the
                            action of Japan as constituting notice that Japan intended to pursue a
                            policy of force and conquest, and, as there was no basis apparent
                            calling for filling Indochina with Japanese military and other forces as
                            a measure for defending Japan, the United States must assume that Japan
                            was taking the last step before proceeding on a policy of expansion and
                            conquest in the region of the South Seas. Finally, the Acting Secretary
                            said that in these circumstances the Secretary of State—with whom he had
                            talked a few minutes before—could not see any basis for pursuing further
                            the conversations in which the Secretary and the Ambassador had been
                            engaged.</p>
                        <p>On the following day, July 24, the Acting Secretary of State made a
                            statement to the press<note n="6a" xml:id="d237fn6a"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_315">p. 315</ref>.</note> in regard
                            to the situation in which statement he characterized the Japanese action
                            in Indochina substantially as he had done in his statement of the
                            previous day to the Japanese Ambassador; he pointed out also that these
                            Japanese actions endangered the use of the Pacific by peaceful nations;
                            that these actions tended to jeopardize the procurement by the United
                            States of essential materials such as tin and rubber, which were
                            necessary in our defense program; and that the steps which Japan was
                            taking endangered the safety of other areas of the Pacific, including
                            the Philippine Islands.</p>
                        <p>16. As it became increasingly clear that Japanese movement into southern
                            Indochina was in progress, the President, on July 24, 1941, orally made
                            to the Japanese Ambassador for transmission to the Japanese Government a
                            proposal that if the Japanese Government would refrain from occupying
                            French Indochina and establishing bases there with its military and
                            naval forces—or, in case such steps had already actually been begun,
                            would withdraw such forces—the President would seek to obtain from the
                            British, the Chinese and the Netherlands Governments—and the United
                            States would itself give—a solemn and binding declaration to regard
                            French Indochina as a “neutralized” country, provided the Japanese
                            Government would <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0408"/>give a similar
                            commitment. Such a declaration would imply that none of the Governments
                            making the declaration would undertake any military act of aggression
                            against French Indochina and that each of these Governments would
                            refrain from exercising any military control within or over French
                            Indochina. The President’s proposal also contemplated that the
                            Government of the United States would endeavor to obtain from the other
                            interested powers a guarantee that so long as the present emergency
                            continued the local French authorities in Indochina would remain
                            undisturbed in control of the territory. If these steps were taken, the
                            President said, Japan would be given binding proof that no other power
                            had any hostile designs on Indochina and that Japan would be afforded
                            the fullest and freest opportunity of assuring for itself a source of
                            food supplies and other raw materials which—according to Japan’s
                            accounts—Japan was seeking to secure. (On July 31 the Acting Secretary
                            of State informed the Japanese Ambassador that the President desired to
                            extend his proposal with regard to French Indochina to include Thailand
                            as well.)</p>
                        <p>17. Large Japanese forces, however, soon were moved into southern
                            Indochina. Japan’s constant expansion of her military position in the
                            southwest Pacific had already substantially imperiled the security of
                            the United States along with that of other powers. By this further
                            expansion in southern Indochina Japan virtually completed the
                            encirclement of the Philippine Islands and placed its armed forces
                            within striking distance of vital trade routes. This constituted an
                            overt act directly menacing the security of the United States and other
                            powers that were at peace with Japan. It created a situation in which
                            the risk of war became so great that the United States and other
                            countries concerned were confronted no longer with the question of
                            avoiding such risk but from then on with the problem of preventing a
                            complete undermining of their security. No sooner were Japanese military
                            forces moved into southern Indochina than there began to appear evidence
                            that there was in progress a vigorous under-cover movement of Japanese
                            infiltration into Thailand. With Japan’s armed forces poised for further
                            attacks, the possibility of averting armed conflict lay only in the bare
                            chance that there might be reached some agreement which would cause
                            Japan to abandon her policy and procedure of aggression. Under those
                            circumstances and in the light of those considerations, the Government
                            of the United States decided at that point, as did certain other
                            governments especially concerned, that discontinuance of trade with
                            Japan had become an appropriate, warranted and necessary step—as an open
                            warning to Japan and as a measure of self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter no conversations were held on the subject of an agreement
                            until in August the Japanese Government took a new initiative. <pb

                        <p>18. On July 26, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order freezing
                            Japanese assets in the United States.<note n="7" xml:id="d237fn7"><hi

                            all financial and import and export trade transactions in which Japanese
                            interests were involved, and the effect of this was to bring about very
                            soon the virtual cessation of trade between the United States and
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>19. Just before the Japanese went into French Indochina with large forces
                            late in July, the Japanese Government effected a reconstruction of the
                            Cabinet, under which Admiral Toyoda took over from Mr. Matsuoka the
                            portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Matsuoka was relieved of office
                            because he had lost the confidence of Prince Konoe and the dominant
                            elements in Japanese political circles. Prince Konoe remained Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>20. Thereafter the Japanese Prime Minister, the new Japanese Foreign
                            Minister and the Japanese Ambassador to the United States (Admiral
                            Nomura) emphatically and repeatedly, both in Tokyo and in Washington,
                            made protestations of Japan’s desire for peace and an equitable
                            settlement of Pacific problems. Notwithstanding these protestations of
                            peaceful intent, the Japanese Government went on with mobilization in
                            Japan and stationing of more and more armed forces in Manchuria, in
                            Indochina, and in south China, and with the bombing of American property
                            in China, including bursts (apparently deliberate) which damaged the
                            American Embassy and the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Tutuila</hi> at

                        <p>21. The Japanese Government did not reply to the President’s proposal of
                            July 24 until August 6. On the latter date the Japanese Ambassador
                            presented a proposal which he said was intended to be responsive to the
                            President’s proposal.</p>
                        <p>This Japanese proposal provided <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> for
                            removal of restrictions which the United States had imposed upon trade
                            with Japan, for the “suspension” of “its [the United States’] military
                            measures in the southwest Pacific area”, and for the exercise of good
                            offices by the United States for the initiation of direct negotiations
                            between Japan and China. It provided also for withdrawal of Japanese
                            troops from Indochina after a settlement should be reached between Japan
                            and China, and called for recognition by the United States of Japan’s
                            special position in Indochina even after the withdrawal of <pb n="344"
                                xml:id="pg_344" facs="0410"/>Japanese troops. Throughout the
                            conversations, it had been specified or implied that the Japanese would
                            expect that the American Government in the proposed exercise of its good
                            offices between China and Japan should discontinue aid to China.</p>
                        <p>This proposal of August 6 entirely disregarded the President’s suggestion
                            for the neutralization of Indochina; it asked <hi rend="italic">inter
                                alia</hi> either expressly or by implication that the United States
                            (1) remove the restrictions it had imposed upon trade with Japan; (2)
                            suspend its defensive preparations in the Philippines; (3) discontinue
                            furnishing military equipment to Great Britain and the Netherlands for
                            the arming of their Far Eastern possessions; (4) discontinue aid to the
                            Chinese Government; and (5) assent to Japan’s assertion and exercise of
                            a special military position and a permanent preferential political and
                            economic status in Indochina, involving, as this would, assent to
                            procedures and disposals which menaced the security of the United States
                            and which were contrary to the principles to which this Government was
                            committed. In return the Japanese Government offered not to station
                            Japanese troops in regions of the southwestern Pacific other than
                            Indochina. It proposed to retain its military establishment in Indochina
                            for an indeterminate period. There thus would still have remained the
                            menace to the security of the United States, already mentioned, as well
                            as the menace to the security of British and Dutch territories in the
                            southwestern Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>This Government patiently analyzed and discussed with the Japanese
                            representatives this limited and one-sided offer but adhered to its
                            position that an agreement must be based upon broad-gauge liberal
                            principles fair to all nations.</p>
                        <p>22. The Secretary of State on August 8 informed the Japanese Ambassador
                            that the Japanese Government’s proposal was lacking in responsiveness to
                            the suggestion made by the President. The Japanese Ambassador then
                            inquired whether it might not be possible for the responsible heads of
                            the two Governments to meet with a view to discussing means for reaching
                            an adjustment of views between the two Governments. The Secretary, first
                            reviewing briefly the steps which had led to a discontinuance of the
                            informal conversations, said that it remained for the Japanese
                            Government to decide whether it could find means of shaping its policies
                            along lines which would make possible an adjustment of views.</p>
                        <p>23. Between August 8 and September 6 there took place various
                            developments in consequence of which there was revived in the mind of
                            the American Government a hope that there might be a possibility that
                            the Japanese Government might yet be willing to adopt and to apply in
                            practice a liberal progressive program in relation to the entire Pacific
                            area. Among these developments were assurances <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0411"/>which were given by the Japanese
                            Government, such as the assurances contained in the Japanese Prime
                            Minister’s message to the President delivered on August 28 (described in
                            paragraph numbered 25 below), and evidence that the trend of the war in
                            the eastern European theater where Russia had demonstrated a capacity
                            for successful resistance against Germany must have thoroughly upset
                            Axis calculations.</p>
                        <p>24. On August 17, the President returned to Washington from the Atlantic
                            Conference at which he and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill,
                            had discussed among other problems the situation in the Far East. Mr.
                            Churchill stated that the British Government fully supported the
                            proposal made on July 24 by the President to the Japanese Government in
                            regard to the withdrawal of Japanese forces from Indochina and informed
                            the President of the British Government’s view that it needed more time
                            to prepare for resistance against any Japanese attack in the Far East.
                            This consideration applied also to the state of our defensive
                            preparations in the Philippine Islands. The President and Mr. Churchill
                            agreed that the American and the British Governments should take
                            parallel action in warning Japan against new moves of aggression. The
                            President and Mr. Churchill agreed also that this Government should be
                            prepared to continue its conversations with the Japanese Government and
                            by such means to offer Japan a reasonable and just alternative to the
                            course upon which Japan was engaged. Accordingly, the President on the
                            day of his return handed to the Japanese Ambassador two documents. In
                            one of these documents it was pointed out that the principles and
                            policies under discussion in conversations between the two Governments
                            precluded expansion by force or threat of force and that if the Japanese
                            Government took any further steps in pursuance of a program of
                            domination by force or threat of force of neighboring countries, this
                            Government would be compelled to take any and all steps necessary toward
                            safeguarding its legitimate rights and interests and toward insuring the
                            security of the United States. In the second document reference was made
                            to the desire expressed earlier in August by the Japanese Government to
                            resume conversations and to the Ambassador’s suggestion, advanced on
                            August 8, that President Roosevelt and the Japanese Prime Minister meet
                            with a view to discussing means for an adjustment of relations between
                            the United States and Japan; and reaffirmation was made of this
                            Government’s intention not to consider any proposals affecting the
                            rights of either country except as such proposals might be in conformity
                            with the basic principles to which the United States has long been
                            committed and of its intention to continue to follow its policy of
                            aiding nations resisting aggression. It was pointed out that informal
                            discussions with the Japanese Government relative to a peaceful
                            settlement would naturally <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0412"
                            />envisage the working out of a progressive program involving the
                            application to the entire Pacific area of the principle of equality of
                            commercial opportunity and treatment, thus making possible access by all
                            countries to raw materials and other essential commodities; and that
                            such a program would envisage cooperation by all nations of the Pacific
                            toward utilizing all available resources of capital, technical skill and
                            economic leadership toward building up the economies of each country and
                            toward increasing the purchasing power and raising the standards of
                            living of the nations and peoples concerned. The opinion was expressed
                            that if Japan was seeking what it affirmed to be its objectives the
                            program outlined was one that could be counted upon to assure Japan
                            satisfaction of its economic needs and legitimate aspirations with much
                            greater certainty than could any other program. The statement was made
                            that, in case Japan desired and was in a position to suspend its
                            expansionist activities, to readjust its position, and to embark upon a
                            peaceful program for the Pacific along the lines of the program and
                            principles to which the United States was committed, the Government of
                            the United States would be prepared to consider resumption of the
                            informal exploratory discussions which had been interrupted in July, and
                            would be glad to endeavor to arrange a suitable time and place to
                            exchange views. It was also stated that, before renewal of the
                            conversations or proceeding with plans for a meeting of the heads of the
                            two Governments, it would be helpful if the Japanese Government would
                            furnish a clearer statement than had as yet been given of its present
                            attitude and plans. If the Japanese Government continued its movement of
                            force and conquest, “we could not,” the President said to the
                            Ambassador, “think of reopening the conversations”.</p>
                        <p>25. On August 18 the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs gave to
                            Ambassador Grew an oral statement in which <hi rend="italic">inter
                                alia</hi> it was affirmed that the only way to prevent the present
                            strained relations between the two countries from further deteriorating
                            into a critical situation would be through a direct meeting between the
                            President and the Japanese Prime Minister and it was proposed that such
                            a meeting be held at Honolulu. The Minister for Foreign Affairs urged
                            upon the Ambassador the need of holding the proposal in strict secrecy
                            on the ground that premature leakage of the fact of the proposal would
                            result in the project being torpedoed by certain elements in Japan.</p>
                        <p>On August 28 the Japanese Ambassador handed to the President a message
                            from the Japanese Prime Minister urging that a meeting be arranged
                            between the heads of the two Governments to discuss all important
                            problems between Japan and the United States covering the entire Pacific
                            area. Accompanying that message was a statement of the Japanese
                            Government in which there were given assurances <pb n="347"
                                xml:id="pg_347" facs="0413"/>with several qualifications of Japan’s
                            peaceful intentions and assurances that Japan was seeking a program for
                            the Pacific area consistent with the principles to which the Government
                            of the United States had long been committed. The qualifications were to
                            the following effect: the Japanese Government was prepared to withdraw
                            its troops from Indochina “as soon as the China Incident is settled or a
                            just peace is established in East Asia”; Japan would take no military
                            action against the Soviet Union as long as the Soviet Union remained
                            faithful to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty and did “not menace
                            Japan or Manchukuo or undertake any action contrary to the spirit of the
                            said Treaty”; the Japanese Government had no intention of using “without
                            provocation” military force against any neighboring nation.</p>
                        <p>26. On September 3 the President gave the Japanese Ambassador replies to
                            the message and the statement received from the Ambassador on August 28.
                            In formulating his replies, the President could not overlook the
                            attendant circumstances and developments, which have already been
                            described. Because of these circumstances and developments, the
                            President and his consultants felt that, to ensure any hope of the
                            success of a meeting between the President and the Prime Minister,
                            achievement of a prior meeting of minds on basic principles was a
                            necessary condition precedent. Hence, the President in replying
                            expressed a desire to collaborate with the Japanese Prime Minister to
                            see whether there could be made effective in practice the program
                            referred to by the Japanese Government in its message of August 28 and
                            whether there could be reached a meeting of minds on fundamental
                            principles which would make practicable a meeting such as the Japanese
                            Prime Minister had proposed. It was pointed out that cognizance had to
                            be taken of evidence of the existence in Japan of concepts which if
                            dominant in that country would raise serious obstacles to successful
                            collaboration between the heads of the two Governments. It was therefore
                            suggested that it would seem highly desirable for precaution to be taken
                            toward insuring that the proposed meeting if held, would prove a
                            success, by endeavoring to enter immediately upon preliminary
                            discussions of the fundamental and essential questions on which
                            agreement was sought. It was further explained that the Government of
                            the United States could not enter into any agreement which would be
                            inconsistent with the principles in which the American people—and the
                            people of all nations which prefer peaceful methods to methods of
                            force—believe. At no time, then or later, did the Government of the
                            United States reject the Japanese proposal for a meeting; it strove hard
                            to bring about a situation which would make the holding of such a
                            meeting beneficial.</p>
                        <p>27. On September 4 the Chinese Ambassador called upon the Secretary of
                            State and made inquiry about the reported conversations between <pb
                                n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0414"/>this Government and the
                            Japanese Government. The Secretary informed the Ambassador that
                            exploratory conversations with the Japanese were taking place but that
                            no common basis for negotiations had as yet been revealed. The Secretary
                            repeated what he had told the Ambassador previously in May, namely, that
                            this Government before considering negotiations with Japan affecting the
                            situation in China would expect to discuss the entire subject with the
                            Chinese Government and, he added, with the British, the Dutch and the
                            Australian Governments as well. Furthermore, a few days later the
                            American Ambassador at Chungking, under authorization from the Secretary
                            of State, informed the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs of what the
                            Secretary had already informed the Chinese Ambassador, as indicated
                            above. The American Ambassador also stated, under authorization, that in
                            this Government’s conversations with the Japanese relating to a general
                            settlement of Pacific problems no consideration had been given or would
                            be given to any sort of arrangement allowing for continuance of
                            aggression in China and that this Government in the course which it had
                            been and was pursuing in its relations with both Japan and China had no
                            intention of sacrificing the fundamental principles and policies which
                            this Government had long believed constituted the only sound basis for
                            stable relations between nations; that it was not to be expected that
                            those measures which this Government had taken with respect to Japan
                            would be altered or discontinued until the situation which had prompted
                            them had been altered or done away with; and that similarly this
                            Government would continue its policy of aiding any nation resisting
                            aggression, as this policy was based upon fundamental principles
                            including the principle of self-defense and had been fully endorsed by
                            the Congress.</p>
                        <p>28. Following the making of the President’s interim reply of September 3,
                            the Japanese Ambassador on September 6 handed the Secretary of State a
                            new draft of proposals which the Ambassador said he was presenting in
                            consequence of his representations to his Government in regard to the
                            desirability of reaching an agreement in principle on the fundamental
                            questions involved before making arrangements for the meeting between
                            the heads of the two Governments. The provisions put forward in the new
                            draft were much narrower than might warrantably have been expected from
                            the comparatively liberal assurances given in the statement communicated
                            to the President on August 28.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese draft of September 6 included a statement of Japan’s
                            position with regard to the Tripartite Pact, containing the evasive
                            formula “in case the United States should participate in the European
                            War, the interpretation and execution of the Tripartite Pact by Japan
                                <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0415"/>shall be independently
                            decided”. As only the United States could be the judge of its
                            self-defense, such a formula offered no assurance that Japan would not
                            interpret its obligations under the Tripartite Pact as impelling it to
                            attack the United States in the event of American involvement through
                            acts of self-defense in war with Germany. The Japanese draft of
                            September 6 included among other points a qualified undertaking that
                            Japan would not “make any advancement from French Indochina against any
                            of its adjoining areas, and likewise will not, <hi rend="underline"
                                >without</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">justifiable</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">reason</hi> [underscoring added] resort to military
                            action against any region South of Japan”. (The limitation “South of
                            Japan” was suggestive.)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador said definitely that he believed that these
                            formulas regarding these two points represented the maximum which Japan
                            could offer at the time. He continued, however, to emphasize Japan’s
                            desire for peace in the Pacific and said that there was more between the
                            lines than could be openly stated. The Japanese endeavored to impress
                            upon representatives of this Government the urgent need of quick action
                            but did not give indication of any intention on Japan’s part to accept
                            the fundamental principles and provisions of peace and equity which
                            alone could have made rapid progress possible.</p>
                        <p>The provisions in the Japanese draft of September 6 contained no
                            commitment in regard to the nature of the terms which Japan would offer
                            to China; they contained no assurance of an intention by Japan to
                            respect China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, to refrain from
                            interference in China’s internal affairs, not to station Japanese troops
                            indefinitely in wide areas of China, and to conform to the principle of
                            nondiscrimination in international commercial relations. The formula
                            contained in that draft that “<hi rend="underline">so</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">long</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">as</hi>

                            will not be restricted” clearly implied a concept that the conditions
                            under which American trade and commerce in China were henceforth to be
                            conducted was to be a matter for decision by Japan.</p>
                        <p>While in the Japanese draft of September 6 Japan’s peaceful intentions
                            were reaffirmed, the ominously significant qualifications in regard to a
                            general basic settlement remained unaltered.</p>
                        <p>In what was apparently an effort to make the Japanese proposals appear
                            more attractive, the Japanese Prime Minister in a conversation with the
                            American Ambassador at Tokyo on September 6 indicated that the Japanese
                            Government fully and definitely subscribed to the four principles which
                            the Secretary of State had previously set forth as a basis for the
                            reconstruction of relations with Japan: respect for the territorial
                            integrity and the sovereignty of each and all nations; support of the
                            principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of <pb n="350"
                                xml:id="pg_350" facs="0416"/>other countries; support of the
                            principle of equality, including equality of commercial opportunity;
                            nondisturbance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in the Pacific
                            except as the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> may be altered by
                            peaceful means. However, a month later the Japanese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs indicated to Ambassador Grew that, while these four points had
                            been accepted “in principle”, certain adjustments would be necessary in
                            applying these principles to actual conditions.</p>
                        <p>The adjustments which the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated
                            would be necessary to apply to these principles would require that the
                            Secretary of State, in order fully to evaluate the importance of the
                            adjustments, estimate how far the military element in Japan would go
                            toward the adoption of courses which would make an agreement with the
                            United States possible. It is obvious that this Government could not
                            disregard the close relationship between the political ascendancy of the
                            army in Japan and Japan’s past and current courses of expansion by
                            force, together with the relationship between expansionist Japan and
                            expansionist Germany as formalized in the Tripartite Alliance, as
                            already described; nor, in gauging the prospects of Prince Konoe’s being
                            able to influence the military in the direction of policies of peace,
                            could this Government overlook the Prince’s close association with the
                            policies of the military elements at various past stages in the
                            unfolding of Japan’s program of conquest in China. The military element
                            in Japan had been embarked upon a course of aggression since 1931 and
                            had become steadily more and more dominant in charting the course of
                            Japan’s high policy. Prince Konoe had headed the Japanese Government in
                            1937 when Japan attacked China; he had proclaimed the basic principles
                            which the Japanese Government presumably would insist upon in any peace
                            agreement with China; the Japanese Government had shown in the “treaty”
                            which Japan had concluded in November 1940 with the Japanese puppet
                            regime at Nanking how it proposed to apply these principles. This
                            “treaty” contained provisions that Japan should, “in order to carry out
                            the defence against communistic activities through collaboration of the
                            two countries, station required forces in specified areas of Mengchiang
                            and of North China for the necessary duration”; that China should
                            “recognize that Japan may, in accordance with previous practices or in
                            order to preserve the common interests of the two countries, station for
                            a required duration its naval units and vessels in specified areas
                            within the territory of the Republic of China”; that “while considering
                            the requirements of China, the Government of the Republic of China shall
                            afford positive and full facilities to Japan and Japanese subjects” with
                            respect to the utilization of resources.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>The Japanese had at no time budged from or relaxed their insistence that
                            the Chinese Government would have to accept the preferential position
                            and arrangements for interference in China which Japan had provided for
                            itself in the “treaty” with Wang Ching-wei.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States was fully aware that the leaders of
                            the Japanese armed forces, in causing the Japanese spokesmen to maintain
                            in the exploratory conversations with this Government a rigid attitude
                            and position, were acting in the light of their knowledge or estimate of
                            the internal situation in this country, of the state of comparative
                            military unpreparedness of the United States and of other powers
                            friendly to the United States and possessed of important interests in
                            the Pacific area, and of the commitments of the United States and its
                            friends elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>As already stated, the Japanese Government had urged that its suggestion
                            of a meeting between the President and Prince Konoe be kept strictly
                            secret—on the ground that premature disclosure would result in the plan
                            being frustrated by elements in Japan hostile to any such move. If this
                            was the true reason for the importance which the Japanese Government
                            attached to secrecy, it would indicate, despite Japanese affirmations to
                            the contrary, that there existed in Japan a substantial opposition to
                            the making of efforts to achieve an improvement in relations with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Account also had to be taken of the psychological factors and
                            complications, and of relations with other countries.</p>
                        <p>The very fact of a meeting being held by the President and the Japanese
                            Prime Minister, following on the heels of a meeting between the
                            President and the British Prime Minister, would cause China extreme
                            disquietude.</p>
                        <p>If the proposed meeting accomplished no more than to give endorsement to
                            general principles, the Japanese would then have been in position to use
                            such endorsement by the United States in support of any interpretation
                            which Japan might choose to place upon those principles in their
                            subsequent application. The United States had had experience of such a
                            procedure in the aftermath of the agreement into which Viscount Ishii
                            had drawn the United States Government in the Lansing-Ishii exchange of
                            notes in 1917.<note n="8a" xml:id="d237fn8a">See <ref

                        <p>If the proposed meeting did not produce an agreement, the leaders of the
                            Japanese armed forces would then have been in position to convince the
                            Japanese people that the United States was responsible for the failure
                            of the meeting and to strengthen public support for a program of all-out
                            aggression.</p>

                        <p>There was no indication that there was any material difference in views
                            as to fundamentals of national objectives between Prince Konoe and the
                            Japanese generals and the admirals who were to proceed with him to the
                            proposed meeting. (From a report by Ambassador Grew of a statement made
                            to him on September 6 by the Japanese Prime Minister this Government
                            learned of Prince Konoe’s intention to have certain high army and navy
                            officers accompany him to the proposed meeting with the President.)
                            There was nothing tangible on which to base an expectation that, at such
                            a meeting, Japan’s spokesman (Prince Konoe) would be able to commit his
                            country to other than broadly generalized and extensively qualified
                            provisions of agreement.</p>
                        <p>There were cogent reasons for belief that unless the Japanese could be
                            brought either before such a meeting or at such a meeting to the making
                            of specific and substantially detailed pledges the only real effect of
                            such an agreement as might conceivably be concluded would be to
                            facilitate operations by Japan’s military leaders toward achievement of
                            their “New Order” program for eastern Asia and the Western Pacific
                            Area.</p>
                        <p>These many considerations caused this Government to feel that it could
                            not take so significant a step in reliance solely upon assurances given
                            by the Japanese Premier and his Foreign Office that Prince Konoe would
                            be prepared at the proposed meeting to give directly to the President
                            commitments of a satisfactory character.</p>
                        <p>In the process of carefully analyzing and evaluating all of the
                            information available to it and bearing on this and related questions,
                            the Government of the United States was driven to the inescapable
                            conclusion that the forces in Japan which were determined to carry on
                            with the course of expansion were so strong that only an advance meeting
                            of minds on the interpretation and to some degree at least the practical
                            application of principles of peace to concrete problems of the Pacific
                            area with respect to which fundamental differences of opinion between
                            the two Governments had developed in the informal conversations would
                            warrant entry upon a full-dress negotiation and reliance thereafter by
                            the United States upon general pledges which might be given by Prince
                            Konoe in the course of conversations and a negotiation between himself
                            and the President.</p>
                        <p>Neither Prince Konoe nor any of Japan’s spokesmen were offering any
                            convincing evidence in support of their affirmation that Japan’s leaders
                            were prepared to revert to peaceful courses and would, were the proposed
                            conference held, demonstrate with pledges and then or thereafter by acts
                            that such was their intention.</p>
                        <p>Under those circumstances, although the President would, as he has said,
                            “have been happy to travel thousands of miles to meet the Premier of
                            Japan”, it was felt by him and by the Secretary of State and by their
                            consultants, including officers of the Department of State who are
                            specialists in Far Eastern affairs, that the President could <pb n="353"
                                xml:id="pg_353" facs="0419"/>proceed to such a rendezvous only if
                            there were first obtained tentative commitments in harmony with the
                            principles and objectives of American policy and with Japan’s professed
                            desire to pursue a peaceful course. Every effort to obtain such
                            commitments proved vain.</p>
                        <p>After September 6, there followed a series of discussions between
                            representatives of the two Governments, both in Washington and in Tokyo.
                            These, however, did not result in any progress toward overcoming the
                            divergences in the views of the two Governments. On September 27 the
                            Japanese Ambassador presented to the Secretary of State a complete new
                            redraft of the Japanese proposals (identical with the so-called
                            “September 25th proposal” handed by the Japanese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to the American Ambassador at Tokyo) and urged that an early
                            reply be made. The new redraft did not indicate any modification of the
                            attitude of the Japanese Government on fundamental points.</p>
                        <p>29. On October 2 the Secretary of State gave to the Japanese Ambassador a
                            memorandum of an “oral statement” reviewing significant developments in
                            the conversations and explaining this Government’s attitude toward
                            various points in the Japanese proposals which did not appear to this
                            Government to be consistent with the principles to which this country
                            was committed. In this it was stated that it was the President’s earnest
                            hope that discussion of the fundamental questions might be so developed
                            that a meeting between the heads of the two Governments could be held,
                            and that it was likewise the President’s hope that the Japanese
                            Government shared the conviction of this Government that, if the
                            Governments of Japan and of the United States were resolved to give
                            practical and comprehensive application to the principles upon which the
                            conversations were based, the two Governments could work out a
                            rehabilitation of their relations and contribute to the bringing about
                            of a lasting peace in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>In formulating this Government’s reply of October 2 to the Japanese
                            Government, outlined above, this Government reviewed the Japanese
                            proposals as a whole and in the light of the surrounding circumstances.
                            There were certain broad considerations which this Government had to
                            take into account in regard to general questions involved and without
                            reference to any one proposal among those that the Japanese Government
                            had offered. These broad considerations also affected the possibilities
                            of there being achieved by the two Governments a satisfactory
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>For years Japanese publicists and leaders had been preaching territorial
                            aggrandizement on the ground that it was essential to Japan’s security
                            that Japan have control of additional sources of war materials in order
                            to ensure to Japan economic and military self-sufficiency. The Japanese
                            military leaders were committed to this doctrine and so were many
                            Japanese civilian leaders. Consequently, if, as a result of the
                            increasing gravity of the Axis menace to the security of the <pb n="354"
                                xml:id="pg_354" facs="0420"/>United States, this country had become
                            obliged, even though it might not actually be at war, to divert its
                            principal strength to the Atlantic area, the plain logic of the
                            situation was that the pressure in Japan upon the Government to take
                            advantage of American preoccupation in the Atlantic area by seizing
                            territories in the southwest Pacific region would have become so strong
                            that it would have been practically impossible to deter Japan from
                            embarking upon new activities of conquest.</p>
                        <p>It was clear that the commitments which the Japanese spokesmen had shown
                            themselves in position to give, even if they were to be carried out to
                            the letter, fell far short of constituting a general renunciation by
                            Japan of courses of aggression, especially in reference to China, failed
                            to clarify Japan’s obligations under the Tripartite Pact in the
                            contingency of involvement by the United States in a war with Germany,
                            and thus failed to provide a sound and adequate basis for an agreement
                            that could be relied upon to contribute to a lasting peace and therefore
                            to stability and security in the Pacific area. The problem which
                            confronted this Government for first consideration was that of eliciting
                            from the Japanese Government clear-cut evidence that that Government
                            really wished to abandon the course of aggression which it had been
                            following and to revert to a peaceful program and peaceful methods. Not
                            until that question had been satisfactorily disposed of would any useful
                            purpose be served by this Government’s addressing itself to the problem
                            of means of ensuring that the Japanese Government would implement new
                            commitments to pursue a peaceful course.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the exploratory conversations this Government had
                            previously given the Japanese Government a full exposition of its policy
                            of self-defense against Germany’s movement of world conquest and had
                            endeavored to elicit from the Japanese Government assurances that Japan
                            would not be bound under the Tripartite Pact to attack the United States
                            should the United States become involved in war with Germany through
                            acts of self-defense. The Japanese Government could not be brought to
                            give any assurance on this point but had insisted that it must be the
                            judge in the event that the United States did become involved in war
                            with Germany whether the circumstances were such that the United States
                            could be regarded as having acted in self-defense. This Government
                            repeatedly had pointed out to the Japanese Government the inconsistency
                            between the Japanese Government’s position with regard to the Tripartite
                            Pact and Japan’s professed desire for an agreement with the United
                            States designed to ensure peace in the Pacific area. This Government
                            also had pointed out to the Japanese Government that the Japanese
                            Government was proposing to this Government an agreement under which
                            Japan, a third country, would be the judge whether any action which this
                            country <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0421"/>might be impelled to
                            take in relations with Germany constituted self-defense.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese spokesmen had made it clear that the Japanese Government
                            would expect as a minimum in an agreement with the United States, among
                            other terms, the removal forthwith by the United States of the
                            restrictions which it had imposed upon trade with Japan, and that the
                            maximum that the Japanese Government was prepared to offer in return was
                            to shift elsewhere the Japanese troops in southern Indochina and to
                            agree not to extend Japanese military moves beyond Indochina southward.
                            As already stated, the Japanese Government had at no time budged from
                            insistence upon an intention to station troops for an unlimited period
                            in wide areas of China, upon retention of a preferential economic
                            position in China and upon maintaining its alliance with the Axis. If
                            the United States were to enter into an agreement with Japan on such
                            terms, this Government at the outset would have to implement immediately
                            a comprehensive concession in the economic field. There would be no
                            method by which the American Government could remove economic pressure
                            upon Japan merely step by step as and when Japan took successive steps
                            away from courses of aggression and toward policies of peace.</p>
                        <p>This Government also had to consider whether such an agreement would be
                            acceptable to the people of this country. It was evident that no
                            agreement would be acceptable to the United States which would involve a
                            sacrifice of those standards of fair play, integrity and honor which the
                            Government and people of this country have long regarded as fundamental
                            to sound international relationships or which would impair the moral
                            influence exercised by the United States among the nations and peoples
                            of the world.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, merely negative assurances by Japan of an absence of intention
                            to continue the prosecution of its forward movement did not and could
                            not adequately meet the needs of the situation; it was essential that
                            Japan also give evidence of a positive intention to pursue policies in
                            conformity with the liberal and constructive principles and programs
                            which had been discussed in the conversations. The necessity for this
                            was clearly demonstrated by the contemporary manifestations of Japanese
                            policy and action which ran exactly to the contrary, as, for example,
                            the movement of Japanese armed forces into southern Indochina, the
                            augmentation and speeding up of Japanese military preparations at home,
                            the continuing bombing by Japanese armed forces of Chinese civilian
                            populations, the constant agitation in the inspired Japanese press in
                            support of extremist policies, the un-conciliatory and bellicose public
                            utterances of Japanese leaders, and the tactics of covert or overt
                            threat which had become a constant feature of Japanese diplomatic
                            procedure.</p>
                        <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>This Government fully realized that the Japanese Government could not,
                            even if it wished, bring about an abrupt transformation in Japan’s
                            current course of action. It realized that so much was involved in a
                            reconstruction of Japan’s position that implementation to any
                            substantial extent by Japan of promises to adopt peaceful courses would
                            require a long time. This Government was therefore prepared to be
                            patient and it had repeatedly so informed the Japanese Government. But
                            there needed to be forthcoming, as an essential prerequisite to an
                            agreement with the United States, evidence in Japan’s acts of a serious
                            and sincere purpose on the part of the Japanese Government to desist
                            from aggression and revert to a program of peace.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese soon after receiving this Government’s memorandum of October
                            2 redoubled their emphasis upon the need of haste. They offered new
                            formulas for dealing with limited and specific problems, and they stated
                            that Japan had now placed all its cards on the table and that they had
                            gone as far as they could in the direction of making so-called
                            “concessions”. This Government was unable to discern in their new
                            formulas any evidence that the Japanese Government was moving even one
                            step toward committing itself to courses of peace or that it
                            contemplated receding even one step from insistence upon full attainment
                            of its declared objectives—which were in effect, judging by the evidence
                            of Japanese official utterances and acts, political, economic, and
                            cultural domination of the entire western Pacific and China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Minister-Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, upon his
                            return to Washington after a two weeks’ visit in Japan, on October 13
                            called on the Under Secretary of State. The Minister said that during
                            his stay in Japan he had conferred with the Prime Minister and with
                            other close advisers of the Emperor as well as with high-ranking
                            officers of the Army and Navy and of the Foreign Office. These persons,
                            Mr. Wakasugi said, had unanimously expressed a desire to maintain peace
                            between Japan and the United States and an earnest and sincere hope that
                            the conversations between the two Governments would produce satisfactory
                            results.</p>
                        <p>The Minister mentioned the existence of a small but very powerful group
                            in Japan which placed its fortunes on the side of the Axis and which was
                            determined to go to any length to prevent the reaching of any
                            understanding between the United States and Japan and to bring Japan
                            squarely into full activity on Germany’s side. He said frankly that
                            German representatives and German agents in Japan, who were undoubtedly
                            increasing their activities, were exceedingly powerful and most
                            effective in their propaganda. He added that although the Japanese
                            Government was backed by the majority of public opinion and by
                            controlling elements in the Japanese Army <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357"
                                facs="0423"/>and Navy, the Government would have to show some
                            results and could not indefinitely continue conversations with the
                            United States. Mr. Wakasugi said that no one could foretell the results
                            which might come if the Japanese Government were to be changed through a
                                <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> or because that Government could
                            see no hope of reaching a satisfactory arrangement with the United
                            States. Mr. Wakasugi said that in all probability the Government would
                            be replaced by a cabinet of military representatives responsible only to
                            German pressure and that in such an event hope of adjusting relations
                            between Japan and the United States must vanish.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Minister’s inquiry, which he said was made under
                            personal instructions from the Prime Minister, as to the reasons for the
                            delay in reaching an agreement or on what points the Government of the
                            United States still desired clarification, the Under Secretary of State
                            said that it was impossible for him to believe that the Japanese
                            Government did not in fact have a clear and specific understanding of
                            the position of the Government of the United States. The Under Secretary
                            went on to point out that the views of this Government had been fully
                            set forth not only in innumerable conversations between the Secretary of
                            State and the Japanese Ambassador but also more specifically in the
                            documents given the Japanese Ambassador on June 21. The Under Secretary
                            added that this Government believed that the Japanese proposals of
                            September 6 had served to restrict, to limit and to modify materially
                            the broad principles upon which we had felt a basis for an understanding
                            had already been reached. In making this observation the Under Secretary
                            had reference to the assurances of the Japanese Government, already
                            referred to, that Japan was seeking a program consistent with the
                            principles to which the United States had long been committed. The Under
                            Secretary added that the views of this Government with regard to the
                            Japanese proposal of September 6 had once more been very clearly set
                            forth in the statement given the Japanese Ambassador on October 2. He
                            therefore felt that there was little that he could add in clarification
                            of the position of this Government.</p>
                        <p>During the course of this conversation the Minister asked whether, if a
                            basis for an understanding on all other major principles were reached,
                            it would not be possible to leave the China question in abeyance. The
                            Under Secretary replied that a question of this sort was like asking
                            whether the play “Hamlet” could be given on the stage omitting the
                            character of Hamlet.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the very insistent question of the Minister whether this
                            Government had any other major desiderata which it had not yet submitted
                            to the Japanese Government, the Under Secretary reiterated his statement
                            that he believed the views of this Government had been <pb n="358"
                                xml:id="pg_358" facs="0424"/>fully set forth in the documents of
                            June 21 and other documents subsequently given to the Japanese
                            Ambassador. The Under Secretary said that it was not the policy of the
                            Government of the United States to attempt to deceive or mislead the
                            other party to a negotiation.</p>
                        <p>There were subsequent conversations with the Japanese Minister on October
                            16 and 17 in which the Secretary of State as well as the Under Secretary
                            of State participated. No new points were developed in these
                            conversations but the Secretary recorded his definite impression that
                            there were no signs of any disposition on the part of the Japanese
                            Government to revert even to a position approximating that which it had
                            taken before the exploratory conversations were temporarily abandoned at
                            the time when Japan in July went into Indochina. The Secretary, while
                            prepared to afford the Japanese every opportunity to present their
                            proposals, entertained increasingly serious doubt whether further
                            conversations would be productive of an agreement.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Advent of the Tojo Cabinet and
                                Redoubling of Japanese Government’s Insistence Upon an Early
                                Acceptance of its Proposals</hi></p>
                        <p>30. On October 17 a new Japanese cabinet, headed by General Tojo, came
                            into office. The new cabinet was even more insistent than the preceding
                            cabinet had been in urging upon this Government a quick decision on the
                            Japanese Government’s proposals. Soon after the new cabinet had come
                            into office, the new Foreign Minister, Mr. Togo, and the Japanese
                            Ambassador came forward with emphatic statements that the new cabinet
                            desired to continue the exploratory conversations looking to peace in
                            the Pacific and to an agreement with the United States. The assurances
                            of peaceful intent given by the previous cabinet were reaffirmed both by
                            the Japanese Ambassador to the Secretary of State and by the Japanese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs to the American Ambassador at Tokyo as
                            representing in general the position of General Tojo’s cabinet.</p>
                        <p>31. The Japanese Government while thus pressing this Government for a
                            decision showed no willingness to effect any fundamental modification of
                            the Japanese position and no desire to apply practically in actual
                            situations the basic principles of justice and equity essential to the
                            building of a lasting peace in the Pacific. At the same time, the
                            Japanese Government was proceeding with its disquieting military
                            disposals in Indochina and Manchuria, and the agitation in the Japanese
                            press and among Japanese spokesmen for positive action became
                            redoubled.</p>
                        <p>32. These military activities, the increasingly threatening tone of the
                            Japanese press, and the pressure tactics employed by the Japanese
                            Government toward forcing an acceptance by this Government of <pb

                            combined to cause to grow fainter any hope that a satisfactory
                            comprehensive agreement might be achieved. Nevertheless the general
                            world situation continued to be very critical, rendering it desirable
                            that every reasonable effort be made to avoid or at least to defer as
                            long as possible any rupture in the conversations. As long as the
                            conversations continued there existed a possibility that Japan might be
                            won over to courses of peace, although it was realized that such
                            possibility was slight. On November 7 the Secretary of State acquainted
                            the cabinet fully with these developments and emphasized that in his
                            opinion a crisis was now imminent in the Far East. The awareness of the
                            administration of the danger which confronted this nation in the general
                            situation was reflected in the President’s Armistice Day Address at the
                            Arlington National Cemetery, in the Secretary of the Navy’s Armistice
                            Day Address before the Providence Chamber of Commerce, and in the Under
                            Secretary of State’s address on the same day at the tomb of President
                            Wilson in the Washington Cathedral.<note n="9" xml:id="d237fn9">For text

                            intervals during this period the Secretary of State had conferences with
                            the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Staff and
                            the Chief of Naval Operations, and officers of their staffs. These
                            conferences sought a full interchange of information and views relative
                            to developments in the Pacific area, and the Secretary took occasion at
                            these conferences to keep the high military and naval authorities of
                            this Government currently informed of significant developments in the
                            conversations with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>33. During this period there were several conversations between officials
                            of this Government, including the President and the Secretary of State,
                            and the Japanese Ambassador and his associates. There were exchanged
                            various memorandums and formulas designed to elaborate or clarify
                            specific points which had arisen in the course of the conversations, as
                            for example in regard to future economic policies of the United States
                            and of Japan, the effect of Japan’s Axis alliance upon Japan’s future
                            relationship to the United States in the event that the United States
                            through acts of self-defense should become involved in the European war,
                            and Japan’s intentions with respect to the future stationing of troops
                            in China; but those steps did not lead to material progress toward
                            reconciling basic differences between the respective viewpoints.</p>
                        <p>34. On November 15 the Secretary of State gave to the Japanese Ambassador
                            an outline for a possible joint declaration by the United States and
                            Japan on economic policy. The Secretary made it clear that this
                            represented but one part of the general settlement envisaged, <pb
                                n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0426"/>and that an agreement on this
                            would be subject to arrival at agreement on a general settlement. This
                            outline was prefaced by an introductory statement in which reference was
                            made to the fact that the cornerstone of the commercial policy of the
                            United States has for many years been the principle of unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment. Reference was made to the extensive
                            program of commercial agreements upon which the United States has been
                            engaged since 1934. It was further pointed out that the United States in
                            its commercial agreements concluded under that program has sought
                            consistently to further the application of that policy throughout the
                            world and that third governments have benefited by the conclusion of
                            those agreements between the United States and other powers. This
                            program of the United States, it was stated, has given the widest
                            possible effect to the reductions of trade barriers and has made the
                            maximum contribution toward building up world trade for the benefit of
                            all nations.</p>
                        <p>The tentative draft joint-declaration of economic policy was divided into
                            three sections: <list>

                                    conditions under which all nations would be given a reasonable
                                    opportunity, through peaceful trade processes, to secure the
                                    means of acquiring goods and commodities needed by each

                                <item>The Governments of the United States and Japan were to

                                    commercial relationships between them; to begin discussions
                                    looking toward the negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement;
                                    and to undertake that during the present emergency each would
                                    permit export to the other of desired commodities subject to
                                    necessary restrictions or limitations required by each for its
                                    security and self-defense.</item>

                                <item>In the Pacific area both Governments were to agree that
                                    complete economic, financial, and monetary control would be
                                    restored to China; that neither Government would seek
                                    preferential or monopolistic commercial or other economic rights
                                    in China; and that both would use their influence toward
                                    securing from China most-favored-nation treatment and full
                                    cooperation of China in the general commercial policy already
                                    outlined. Both Governments were to suggest to China the
                                    inauguration of a comprehensive program of economic development
                                    with most-favored-nation treatment to be given to each in
                                    participation in that program. Both Governments were to seek to
                                    establish with other Pacific countries relations on the basis of
                                    the fundamental principles already set forth and to urge other
                                    Pacific governments to undertake comprehensive programs of
                                    economic development and to accord to both the United States and
                                    Japan most-favored-nation treatment and full opportunity to
                                    participate in those programs when foreign participation might
                                    be required.</item>

                        <p>In the formulating of this draft declaration of economic policy it was
                            envisaged that Japan would be accorded an opportunity of joining <pb
                                n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0427"/>in a virtual moral partnership
                            with the United States in leading the way toward a general application
                            of economic practices which would give Japan much of what her leaders
                            professed that Japan desired.</p>
                        <p>35. In the conversation on November 15 with the Japanese Ambassador, the
                            Secretary of State said that if we were to work out a peaceful
                            settlement in the Pacific area, this could be achieved only by
                            continuing the exploratory conversations until we reached a stage where
                            we could go to the other governments concerned and say that the
                            attitudes of Japan and the United States were such as to afford a basis
                            for negotiation. He said that what we had in mind was to reach without
                            delay a wholly satisfactory and broad agreement which would promote
                            mutual trust between nations in the Pacific area and enable them to get
                            away from the expansion of military preparations; that what he desired
                            was a clear-cut unequivocal agreement which would preclude any
                            reasonable suspicion that Japan was trying to face two ways at the same
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Tripartite Pact, the Secretary of State said that so
                            long as Japan remained bound in an alliance with the most flagrant
                            aggressor that has appeared on this planet in the last two thousand
                            years it would be very difficult for him to make the people of the
                            United States and the people of other peaceful nations believe that
                            Japan was pursuing a peaceful course. He said that so long as Japan
                            insisted upon its own interpretation of its obligations under the
                            Tripartite Pact, it would be very difficult for the world to see that
                            Japan’s clear intention was to follow a peaceful course in the event
                            that the United States through self-defense became obliged to take up
                            arms against Germany. The Secretary asked whether, if an agreement
                            between the United States and Japan were concluded, Japan’s connection
                            with the Tripartite Pact would automatically disappear.</p>
                        <p>In regard to this question the Japanese Ambassador said only that the
                            question of peace in the entire Pacific was covered in the preamble of
                            the Japanese suggested agreement, and that under the Tripartite Pact
                            Japan had freedom of decision and would make its own interpretation of
                            its obligations.</p>
                        <p>At no time throughout the course of the conversations did the Japanese
                            give a satisfactory reply to this important question. The Ambassador
                            did, however, on several occasions make vague statements to the effect
                            that if an agreement were reached with the United States, the
                            psychological effect in Japan would be such that there would be no
                            possibility of Japan interpreting its obligations under the Tripartite
                            Pact adversely to friendly relations with the United States. This
                            Government of course had to evaluate such statements in the light of
                            developments and deep-seated trends in the field of actual events with
                            which such statements were inconsistent.</p>
                        <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>In the conversation of November 15 and in previous conversations the
                            Japanese representatives pressed vigorously for a reply to the already
                            delivered Japanese proposals—so vigorously that the Secretary on the
                            latter occasion, after referring to the attitude which the new
                            Government in Japan had taken in urging that this Government must reply
                            at once and categorically on various points, stated to the Ambassador
                            and the Japanese Minister, Mr. Wakasugi, who was also present on that
                            occasion, that this Government did not feel that it should be receiving
                            such representations, suggestive of ultimatums, from a Government whose
                            contemporary acts were such as were those of Japan.</p>
                        <p>36. Early in November the Japanese Government decided to send Mr. Saburo
                            Kurusu to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura in the conversations.
                            In pursuance of the urgent request of the Japanese Government, this
                            Government facilitated Mr. Kurusu’s journey by arranging that priority
                            passage on a Pan American plane be given Mr. Kurusu and a Japanese
                            Foreign Office secretary accompanying him and that the departure of the
                            plane from Hong Kong be delayed until Mr. Kurusu and his secretary could
                            reach Hong Kong from Tokyo. Mr. Kurusu reached Washington on November
                            15, and on November 17 he and the Japanese Ambassador called on the
                            Secretary of State and were later on the same day received by the
                            President. It became clear at the outset of the meetings in which Mr.
                            Kurusu participated with the Japanese Ambassador that Mr. Kurusu had
                            brought no new material or plans or proposals.</p>
                        <p>37. On November 17 the Japanese Ambassador handed the Secretary of State
                            two documents. In one of these, the statement was made that the Japanese
                            Government had no objection to confirming as expressing the general
                            purport of Japanese policy certain statements which had been made on
                            August 28 by the preceding Japanese Prime Minister and by his Government
                            in documents which had been transmitted to the Government of the United
                            States by the Japanese Ambassador. It was stated also that the various
                            qualifying phrases which the Japanese Government had used in connection
                            with statements of its peaceful intent as expressed in those earlier
                            documents were employed only in order “to express the qualification
                            which is due to and necessary for any sovereign state”, and that those
                            phrases were not intended to limit in any way the peaceful intentions of
                            the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>38. On this same date, November 17, the President and the Secretary of
                            State held a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu.
                            The President made clear the desire of the United States to avoid war
                            between the two countries and to bring about a fair settlement assuring
                            peace in the Pacific area. The Japanese Ambassador said that this was
                            also the desire of Japan.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State made clear that so long as Japan was still
                            clinging to the Tripartite Pact, no purported peaceful settlement for
                            the Pacific area would be taken seriously by anyone. He said that ever
                            since Hitler had announced that he was out for unlimited objectives and
                            had started on a march of invasion across the earth with ten million
                            soldiers and myriads of airplanes, the United States had been in danger,
                            and that the danger had grown with each passing week. He said that the
                            United States recognized this danger and was proceeding with measures of
                            self-defense before it should be too late; that this country felt the
                            danger so profoundly that it had committed itself to expenditure of many
                            billions of dollars in self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Secretary of State said the belief in this country was that
                            the Japanese formula of a “new order in greater East Asia” is but
                            another name for a program to dominate all of the Pacific area
                            politically, economically, socially, and otherwise, by military force;
                            that this would include the high seas, the islands and the continents
                            and, if achieved, would place every other country at the mercy of
                            arbitrary military rule just as the Hitler program does in Europe and
                            the Japanese program does in China.</p>
                        <p>39. Mr. Kurusu said that the Japanese Prime Minister, General Tojo,
                            although an Army man, was very desirous of bringing about a peaceful
                            adjustment. Mr. Kurusu constantly throughout the conversation with the
                            President and the Secretary of State made the plea that there was no
                            reason for serious differences between our two Governments and that ways
                            must be found to resolve the situation. Some specious attempts were made
                            to explain away the Tripartite Pact and efforts were made to defend the
                            Japanese plan of not bringing Japanese troops out of China.</p>
                        <p>40. The Secretary of State conferred again with the Japanese Ambassador
                            and Mr. Kurusu on November 18. The Secretary expressed great doubt
                            whether any agreement into which we entered with Japan while Japan had
                            an alliance with Hitler would carry the confidence of our people. He
                            said that a difficult situation was created when, for example, telegrams
                            of congratulation were sent to Hitler by Japanese leaders when he
                            commits some atrocity, and he emphasized that we would have to have a
                            clear-cut agreement making clear our peaceful purpose, for otherwise
                            there would be a redoubled effort by all nations to strengthen their
                            armaments. He pointed out that we were trying to make a contribution to
                            the establishment of a peaceful world, based on law and order. He said
                            that this is what we want to work out with Japan; that we had nothing to
                            offer in the way of bargaining except our friendship. He said that
                            frankly he did not know whether anything could be done in the matter of
                            reaching a satisfactory agreement with Japan; that we can go so far but
                            rather than go beyond a certain point it would be better for us to stand
                            and take the consequences</p>
                        <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador said that Japan was hard pressed and was
                            therefore very desirous of reaching some agreement with the United
                            States. Mr. Kurusu said that he felt that what the two Governments
                            should now do would be to achieve something to tide over the abnormal
                            situation and that perhaps after the war it might be possible for Japan
                            to adopt a more liberal policy. The Secretary asked whether Japan could
                            not now agree in principle on commercial policy. Mr. Kurusu made no
                            direct reply.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the Tripartite Pact, Mr. Kurusu said that
                            while the Tripartite Pact could not be abrogated Japan might do
                            something to “outshine” that pact. The Secretary emphasized the
                            importance of establishing fundamental principles at this time in order
                            to enable peaceful forces in the world, which are now demoralized, to
                            assert a leadership. Mr. Kurusu asked whether the Secretary had in mind
                            a concrete formula for dealing with Japan’s relations with the Axis. The
                            Secretary made it clear that this was a matter for Japan to work out,
                            but he asked whether Japan could not work this out in some way that
                            would be convincing to the American people, as the public would be
                            confused by the survival of a relationship between Japan and the Axis
                            while Japan had an agreement with the United States. The Secretary said
                            that he felt that the Tripartite Pact was inconsistent with the
                            establishment of an understanding, and that Japan could not face two
                            ways. Mr. Kurusu observed that a comprehensive solution could not be
                            worked out immediately; that our freezing regulations had caused
                            impatience in Japan and a feeling that Japan had to fight while it still
                            could. If we could come to some agreement now, he said, it would promote
                            an atmosphere which would be conducive to discussing fundamentals. The
                            Ambassador said that he desired to emphasize that Japan would not be a
                            “cat’s paw” for Germany and that Japan had entered into the Tripartite
                            Alliance because Japan had felt isolated. The Secretary commented that
                            it would be difficult to get public opinion in this country to
                            understand the situation as Mr. Kurusu had described it.</p>
                        <p>Having in mind the fact that the Japanese proposals had consistently
                            envisaged keeping relatively large numbers of Japanese troops at key
                            points in large areas of China in disregard of Japan’s professed
                            intention to respect China’s sovereignty, the Secretary of State asked
                            how many soldiers the Japanese wanted to retain in China. The Ambassador
                            replied that possibly ninety percent of the present forces would be
                            withdrawn. The Secretary asked how long the Japanese intended to keep
                            the remaining ten percent in China. The Ambassador did not reply
                            directly to this but invited attention to the fact that under the
                            existing Boxer Protocol<note n="10" xml:id="d237fn10"><ref

                            Peiping and Tientsin area.</p>
                        <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0431"/>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that involved in the question of Japanese
                            troops in China there were many elements of trouble; that American
                            interests had suffered severely from the actions of the Japanese troops
                            in China; that the present situation in the Far East was one of Japan’s
                            own making which rendered it incumbent upon Japan to find some way of
                            extricating itself from the difficulty. He pointed out also that the
                            situation was now exceptionally favorable for Japan to put its factories
                            to work in producing goods which were needed by peaceful countries, if
                            only the Japanese people could get war and invasion out of mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that Japan would have to move gradually in China, that
                            one step might lead to another, and that what was important now was to
                            do something to enable Japan to change its course. He suggested that it
                            was felt in Japanese circles that we had been responsible for delay. The
                            Secretary of State pointed out that he had on all occasions received the
                            Japanese Ambassador promptly whenever the Ambassador had sought an
                            appointment, that this Government had from the outset made clear its
                            position, and that when Japan’s movement into Indochina in July took
                            place this had caused an interruption of the conversations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked whether we wanted the <hi rend="italic">status quo
                                ante</hi> to be restored or what we expected Japan to do. The
                            Secretary replied that if the Japanese could not now do anything about
                            these three points, namely, withdrawal of Japanese troops from China,
                            the adoption of a liberal commercial policy, and the question of the
                            Tripartite Pact, he could only leave to Japan what Japan could do. He
                            asked to what extent it would enable Japan to adopt peaceful policies if
                            there should be a relaxation of freezing; and he explained that what he
                            had in mind was means of enabling the more conservative leaders in Japan
                            to gain control of the situation there. The Ambassador said that the
                            American position was unyielding and that it was Japan’s unyielding
                            attitude toward Chiang Kai-shek which had stiffened Chinese resistance
                            against Japan. He suggested as a small beginning toward realization of
                            our high ideals the possibility of going back to the status which
                            existed before the date in July when, following the Japanese move into
                            southern Indochina, our freezing measures were put into effect. The
                            Secretary said that if we should make some modifications in our freezing
                            regulations we would not know whether Japanese troops withdrawn from
                            Indochina would not be diverted to some equally objectionable locality
                            and that it would be difficult for him to get this Government to go a
                            long way in removing freezing measures until this Government believed
                            that Japan was definitely started on a peaceful course and had renounced
                            purposes of conquest. He observed that it was when Japan’s <pb n="366"
                                xml:id="pg_366" facs="0432"/>movement into Indochina took place in
                            July that he could no longer defend the continued shipment of petroleum
                            products to Japan especially as he had been under severe criticism in
                            this country for not having cut off those shipments. The Ambassador said
                            that the Japanese were tired of fighting in China and that Japan would
                            go as far as it could along a first step. The Secretary said he would
                            consult with the British and the Dutch to see what their attitude would
                            be toward the suggestion offered by the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p rend="center">V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Japanese Efforts To Extort an
                                Agreement on a Narrow and One-sided Proposal</hi></p>
                        <p>41. In the course of a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador and Mr.
                            Kurusu on November 20, the Secretary of State said that Japan could at
                            any moment put an end to the present situation by deciding upon an
                            all-out peaceful course; and that Japan could similarly at any moment
                            bring to an end what Japan chose to call “encirclement”. The Secretary
                            further said the American people believed that the purposes underlying
                            our aid to China were the same as those underlying our aid to Great
                            Britain; that there was a partnership between Hitler and Japan aimed at
                            enabling Hitler to take control of one-half of the world and Japan the
                            other half. The existence of the Tripartite Alliance and the continual
                            harping of Japan’s leaders upon slogans of the Nazi type served to
                            strengthen the public in this belief. What was needed, the Secretary
                            pointed out, was a manifestation by Japan of a clear purpose to pursue
                            peaceful courses. He said that our people desired to avoid a repetition
                            in East Asia of what Hitler was doing in Europe; that our people did not
                            welcome the idea of a “new order” under military dictatorship; and that
                            the methods adopted by the Japanese military leaders in China were not
                            unlike Hitler’s methods.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador in the course of this conversation presented a
                            proposal which read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. Both the Governments of Japan and the United States undertake
                                    not to make any armed advancement into any of the regions in the
                                    South-eastern Asia and the Southern Pacific area excepting the
                                    part of French Indo-China where the Japanese troops are
                                    stationed at present.</p>
                                <p>“2. The Japanese Government undertakes to withdraw its troops now
                                    stationed in French Indo-China upon either the restoration of
                                    peace between Japan and China or the establishment of an
                                    equitable peace in the Pacific area.</p>
                                <p>“In the meantime the Government of Japan declares that it is
                                    prepared to remove its troops now stationed in the southern part
                                    of French Indo-China to the northern part of the said territory
                                    upon the conclusion of the present arrangement which shall later
                                    be embodied in the final agreement.</p>
                                <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0433"/>
                                <p>“3. The Government of Japan and the United States shall cooperate
                                    with a view to securing the acquisition of those goods and
                                    commodities which the two countries need in Netherlands East
                                    Indies.</p>
                                <p>“4. The Governments of Japan and the United States mutually
                                    undertake to restore their commercial relations to those
                                    prevailing prior to the freezing of the assets.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that adoption of a proposal such as the Japanese
                            Government had just offered would help develop public opinion in Japan
                            in favor of peaceful courses. He added that Japan was trying to show its
                            peaceful purpose by offering to relieve, pressure on Thailand. The
                            Japanese Ambassador said that there was no doubt of Japan’s desire for
                            peace, as that desire for peace was made clear by the eagerness of the
                            Japanese Government to reach a settlement with China. Mr. Kurusu
                            asserted that Japan has never committed itself to a policy of expansion
                            and that if the Japanese proposal just presented were adopted, we could
                            then proceed to work out fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>The plan thus offered called for supplying by the United States to Japan
                            of as much oil as Japan might require, suspension of freezing measures,
                            and discontinuance by the United States of aid to China. It contained a
                            provision that Japan would shift her armed forces from Southern
                            Indochina to Northern Indochina, but placing no limit on the number of
                            armed forces which Japan might send to Indochina and making no provision
                            for withdrawal of the said forces until after either the restoration of
                            peace between Japan and China or the establishment of an “equitable”
                            peace in the Pacific area. It contained no provision for reversion by
                            Japan to peaceful courses and, while there were stipulations against
                            further extension of Japan’s armed force into southeastern Asia and the
                            southern Pacific (except Indochina), there were no provisions which
                            would have prevented continued or fresh Japanese aggressive activities
                            in any of the regions of Asia lying to the north of Indochina—for
                            example, China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>42. During a conversation on November 22 and in other subsequent
                            conversations the Secretary of State made clear to the Japanese
                            Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu the American attitude on three points with
                            respect to the Japanese proposal of November 20. He emphasized that
                            while we might consider helping Japan by supplying some oil for civilian
                            requirements as soon as peacefully-minded Japanese could control the
                            situation in Japan, we could not furnish oil to the Japanese for any
                            military purpose; that the presence of <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368"
                                facs="0434"/>large Japanese forces in any part of Indochina was a
                            source of apprehension to neighboring countries, would lead to
                            intensification of armaments, and would keep immobilized substantial
                            armed forces of this country and of countries friendly to the United
                            States, which forces might otherwise be used for resistance against Nazi
                            Germany; and that the people of the United States considered that aid
                            from this country to China rested on the same basis as the aid given to
                            Great Britain and it was not reasonable for Japan to expect us to
                            discontinue aid to China while Japan was assisting Germany.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State pointed out that moves by Japan, such as its move
                            in Indochina, would give a further impetus to arming. Further, he said
                            that one more such move on Japan’s part might extinguish our peace
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>During this conversation of November 22 the Secretary of State also
                            informed the Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu that he had called in
                            representatives of certain other governments concerned in the Pacific
                            area and there had been a discussion of the question whether there could
                            be some relaxation of freezing. He said that those representatives were
                            interested in the subject and there was a general feeling that the
                            matter could be settled if the Japanese could give some concrete
                            evidence that their intentions were peaceful. The Secretary said further
                            that if the United States and other countries should see Japan pursuing
                            a peaceful course, there would be no question about Japan’s obtaining
                            all the materials she desired.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the conversation of November 22, the Japanese Ambassador and
                            Mr. Kurusu sought to make much of the Japanese offer to transfer its
                            troops from southern French Indochina to northern French Indochina. They
                            gave no indication whatsoever that Japan wished to consider the broad
                            questions and problems that had been under discussion, but merely
                            devoted themselves to urging an immediate reply to their proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that a great deal of persuasion had been necessary to
                            induce the Japanese Army to agree to abandon its position in southern
                            Indochina, that he and the Ambassador were pleasantly surprised and they
                            considered the agreement by the Army to withdraw from southern Indochina
                            an encouraging sign, but that nevertheless the situation was approaching
                            an explosive point. The Ambassador said that he had not the slightest
                            doubt that Japan desired peace. Mr. Kurusu added that Japan’s offer to
                            remove its forces from southern Indochina would set in motion a reverse
                            movement in Japan. He mentioned the abnormal emotional state of the
                            Japanese people as a result of four years of war and the freezing
                            measures of the United States. Mr. Kurusu said the denunciation by the
                            United States of the commercial treaty with Japan had placed Japan in a
                                <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0435"/>difficult position. The
                            Japanese Ambassador said that Japan needed a quick settlement, and that
                            the psychological effect of such a settlement would be great.</p>
                        <p>43. On the day previous, that is to say, on November 21, Mr. Kurusu had
                            called alone upon the Secretary of State and had handed the Secretary a
                            draft of a formula which he offered, he explained, by way of
                            clarification of Japan’s obligations under the Tripartite Alliance. The
                            formula was embodied in a draft letter, as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. Secretary,</p>
                                <p>“Through several conversations I have had the honor of holding
                                    with Your Excellency, I was rather surprised to learn that a
                                    deep-seated misconception prevails among your people about the
                                    obligation which Japan assumed under the Tripartite Pact.</p>
                                <p>“As Your Excellency is fully aware I am the one who signed the
                                    said treaty under the instructions of my Government; and I am
                                    very happy to make the following statement which I trust will
                                    serve to eradicate the aforesaid false impression: <quote
                                        rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“It goes without saying that this treaty can not and does
                                            not infringe, in any way, upon the sovereign right of
                                            Japan as an independent state.</p>
                                        <p>“Besides, as Article III of the Pact stands, Japan is in
                                            a position to interpret its obligation freely and
                                            independently and is not to be bound by the
                                            interpretation which the other high contracting parties
                                            may make of it. I should like to add that my Government
                                            is not obligated by the aforementioned treaty or any
                                            other international engagement to become a collaborator
                                            or cooperator in any aggression whatever by any third
                                            Power or Powers.</p>
                                        <p>“My Government would never project the people of Japan
                                            into war at the behest of any foreign Power; it will
                                            accept warfare only as the ultimate, inescapable
                                            necessity for the maintenance of its security and the
                                            preservation of national life against active
                                            injustice.</p>

                                <p>“I hope that the above statement will assist you in removing
                                    entirely the popular suspicion which Your Excellency has
                                    repeatedly referred to. I have to add that, when a complete
                                    understanding is reached between us, Your Excellency may feel
                                    perfectly free to publish the present communication.</p>
                                <p>“I have the honor to be, Sir,</p>
                                <p>“Your Excellency’s obedient servant, …”</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State read the draft letter and then asked Mr. Kurusu
                            whether he had anything more to offer on the subject of a peaceful
                            settlement as a whole. Mr. Kurusu replied in the negative. The Secretary
                            said that he did not think that the formula which Mr. Kurusu had just
                            offered would be especially helpful.</p>
                        <p>44. In all of the various formulas which the Japanese Government offered
                            in succession during the course of the conversations every statement of
                            pacific intent was qualified and restricted. As <pb n="370"
                                xml:id="pg_370" facs="0436"/>each proposal was explored it became
                            clear that Japan did not intend to budge one iota from the fundamental
                            tenets of its military leaders. Japan manifested no disposition to
                            renounce its association with Hitlerism. It insisted that its
                            obligations under the Tripartite Alliance—a direct threat to this
                            country—would be fulfilled by Japan. Japan was willing to affirm its
                            adherence to the principle of non-discrimination in international
                            commercial relations, but refused to relinquish in practice the
                            preferential position which it had arrogated to itself in all areas
                            under Japanese occupation. Japan insisted upon obtaining through its use
                            of force in China a victor’s peace and upon having our assent in advance
                            to that procedure and that conclusion. It refused to make practical
                            application of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs
                            of other countries. It insisted upon continuing to maintain its armed
                            forces in large areas of China for an indefinite period—a clear
                            indication of intention to effectuate a permanent control over that
                            country. The Japanese Government made no response whatever to the
                            Secretary of State’s proposal of November 15 in regard to economic
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>It was thus apparent that the Japanese were attempting to maneuver the
                            United States into either accepting the limited Japanese proposals or
                            making some sort of an agreement which would serve no purposes except
                            those of Japan, and that, without giving thought to the solving of basic
                            questions they were intent on evading conclusion of an equitable
                            broad-gauge settlement such as had been under discussion in the earlier
                            stages of the conversations. The only question which remained for
                            exploration was whether, by the conclusion of some temporary arrangement
                            or <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> to tide over the immediate
                            crisis, Japan might be deterred from embarking immediately upon new
                            steps of aggression. Delaying of the evil day might put that day off
                            forever. It at least would give the intended victims more time in which
                            to prepare to resist. Consideration was given by the Secretary and by
                            the President to various projects envisaging such possible
                            consummations. This Government felt it most important to exhaust every
                            effort to avert or delay a resort to force, especially as the heads of
                            this country’s armed services continued to emphasize the need of time to
                            prepare for resistance to attacks that might be made upon us by way of
                            our territories in the Pacific area. Hope of concluding any arrangement,
                            however, became slender indeed in the light of clear indication given by
                            the Japanese authorities that they had no intention of desisting from
                            the menace which they were creating to the United States, to the British
                            Empire, to the Netherlands East Indies, to Thailand, and to China, by
                            the substantial increasing of their armed forces in Indochina and in
                            adjacent waters. In view of that growing menace, of the continuation of
                            the hostilities in China, <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0437"/>of
                            the mobilization of Japanese forces in Manchuria, and of the fact that
                            the Japanese proposal of November 20 offered, as outlined above, no
                            basis for a practical and reassuring settlement, it was obvious that the
                            chance of meeting the crisis by measures of diplomacy had practically
                            vanished. Yet, for the purpose of completely clarifying the issues and
                            of possibly providing material and incentive for a renewed and final
                            effort, it was believed desirable to submit to the Japanese a further
                            draft, comprehensive in terms, which might serve as a basis for possible
                            further discussion.</p>
                        <p>45. On November 26, the Secretary of State gave to the Japanese
                            Ambassador two documents, the first an outline in a tentative form of a
                            proposed basis for agreement between the United States and Japan and the
                            second an explanatory statement concerning and in regard thereto.</p>
                        <p>In those documents there was reviewed briefly the objective sought in the
                            exploratory conversations, namely, that of reaching, if possible, an
                            early settlement of questions relating to the entire Pacific area on the
                            basis of the principles of peace, law and order, and fair dealing among
                            nations. Reference was made to proposals which had been communicated on
                            November 20 by the Japanese Ambassador in regard to arranging temporary
                            measures to be taken by the two Governments respectively and to the fact
                            that the Japanese Ambassador had stated that such a temporary
                            arrangement would be helpful toward creating an atmosphere favorable to
                            the successful outcome of the informal conversations which the
                            Ambassador said the Japanese Government desired to continue. It was
                            observed that while this Government was desirous of contributing to the
                            promotion of peace in the Pacific area and of affording every
                            opportunity for the continuance of the informal conversations, the
                            Japanese proposals in question contained some features which, in the
                            opinion of this Government, conflicted with the fundamental principles
                            underlying the general settlement under consideration; and that this
                            Government believed that the adoption of such proposals would not be
                            likely to contribute to the ultimate objectives. It was therefore
                            suggested that a further effort be made to resolve the divergences of
                            views between the two Governments, and it was stated that, with this
                            object in view, there was being offered for the consideration of the
                            Japanese Government a plan of a broad simple settlement covering the
                            entire Pacific area as one practical exemplification of a program that
                            could be worked out during further conversations.</p>
                        <p>46. The texts of the explanatory statement and of the outline of the
                            proposed basis for agreement between the United States and Japan were as

                                    Recently the Japanese Ambassador has stated that the Japanese

                                    peaceful settlement in the Pacific were continuing. On November
                                    20 the Japanese Ambassador communicated to the Secretary of
                                    State proposals in regard to temporary measures to be taken
                                    respectively by the Government of Japan and by the Government of
                                    the United States, which measures are understood to have been
                                    designed to accomplish the purposes above indicated.</p>
                                <p>“The Government of the United States most earnestly desires to

                                    throughout the Pacific area. The proposals which were presented
                                    by the Japanese Ambassador on November 20 contain some features
                                    which, in the opinion of this Government, conflict with the
                                    fundamental principles which form a part of the general

                        <p>Mr. Kurusu, after reading these documents, offered various depreciatory
                            comments in regard to their contents. He said that the Japanese
                            Government would be likely to throw up its hands when it received this
                            proposal. He said that he felt that the response which had thus been
                            given to the Japanese proposal of November 20 could be interpreted as
                            tantamount to meaning the end of the conversations and he asked whether
                            the United States was not interested in consummating a <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi>. The Secretary replied that this Government had
                            fully explored that matter.</p>
                        <p>47. The President and the Secretary of State received the Japanese
                            Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu on November 27. The President expressed
                            appreciation of the efforts of the peace element in Japan. Most people
                            in the United States, he said, wanted a peaceful solution of all matters
                            in the Pacific area; he himself had not given up yet, although the
                            situation was serious. This Government, he said, had been very much
                            disappointed by the continued expression of opposition by Japanese
                            leaders to the fundamental principles of peace and order which had been
                            discussed in the exploratory conversations with the Japanese
                            representatives. This attitude, he continued, on the part of the
                            Japanese leaders had created an atmosphere, both in the United States
                            and abroad, which had added greatly to the difficulty of making
                            satisfactory progress in the conversations.</p>
                        <p>The President then called attention to the fact that this Government had
                            been very patient in dealing with the whole Far Eastern situation; that
                            we were prepared to continue to be patient if Japan’s course of action
                            would permit continuance of such an attitude on our part. He said that
                            this country could not bring about any substantial relaxation in its
                            economic restrictions unless Japan gave this country some clear
                            manifestation of peaceful intent. If that occurred, we could take some
                            steps of a concrete character designed to improve the general situation.
                            This Government remained convinced, he added, that Japan’s own best
                            interests would not be served by following Hitlerism in courses of
                            aggression and that Japan’s own best interests lay along other courses
                            which we had outlined in the conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that everyone knew that the Japanese slogans of war
                            propaganda such as those used in describing the “new order in East Asia”
                            and the “controlling influence” in certain areas, were all terms to
                            express in a camouflaged manner the policy of force and conquest by
                            Japan, and domination by military agencies of the political, economic,
                            social, and moral affairs of each of the populations <pb n="376"
                                xml:id="pg_376" facs="0442"/>conquered. As long as the Japanese
                            moved in that direction and continued to increase their military and
                            other relations with Hitler through such instruments as the
                            Anti-Comintern Pact<note n="11" xml:id="d237fn11">For text, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_153">p. 153</ref>.</note> and the Tripartite Pact,
                            no real progress could be made on a program of peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>During this conversation the Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu said very
                            little. The Ambassador expressed disappointment that it had not been
                            possible to reach an agreement regarding a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>. Mr. Kurusu said that the difficulty did not lie in the
                            fundamentals so much as in the application of those fundamentals.</p>
                        <p>48. The Secretary of State next conferred with the Japanese Ambassador
                            and Mr. Kurusu on December 1. The Secretary said that in connection with
                            the informal conversations we had to take into account the bellicose
                            utterances emanating from Tokyo. He referred to Japanese military moves
                            in Indochina and emphasized that we did not intend to go into a
                            partnership with Japan’s military leaders; that he had not heard one
                            whisper of peace from them, only bluster and bloodcurdling threats. He
                            said that this Government had no idea of trying to bluff Japan and he
                            saw no occasion for Japan’s trying to bluff us; he emphasized that there
                            is a limit beyond which we cannot go and that one of these days there
                            might come a point beyond which the conversations could not be
                            continued.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that this Government was anxious to help
                            settle the China affair if the Japanese could reach a settlement in
                            accordance with the basic principles which we had discussed in our
                            conversations, and that under such circumstances we would be glad to
                            offer our good offices. He said that under existing circumstances Japan
                            might just as well ask us to cease aiding Great Britain as to cease
                            aiding China. He said that the United States would supply Japan all the
                            materials she wanted if Japan’s military leaders would only demonstrate
                            that Japan intended to pursue a peaceful course.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State observed that the stationing of Japanese troops in
                            Indochina constituted a menace to surrounding areas, irrespective of
                            where in Indochina the troops were stationed; that the stationing of
                            these troops in Indochina was also making it necessary for the United
                            States and its friends to keep large numbers of armed forces immobilized
                            in East Asia; and that in this way Japan’s acts were having the effect
                            of aiding Hitler. He called attention to reports of heavy Japanese troop
                            movements into Indochina and again stressed the point that, with a large
                            Japanese army anywhere in Indochina, we had to give that situation more
                            attention when Japanese statesmen were saying that they would drive us
                            out of East Asia. <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0443"/>In making
                            this statement the Secretary had reference to the reported statement by
                            the Japanese Premier on November 30 that Japan must “purge with a
                            vengeance” the influence of the United States and Great Britain in East
                                Asia.<note n="12" xml:id="d237fn12">See telegram No. 1869, December
                                1, 1941, from the Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_148">p.
                                    148</ref>.</note> The Secretary pointed out that we could not be
                            sure what the Japanese military leaders were likely to do; we did not
                            know where the Japanese army intended to land its forces. He said that
                            we could not sit still while developments, such as Japanese military
                            entrenchment in Indochina, were taking place; that we would not allow
                            ourselves to be driven out of the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>In view of all the confusion, threats and pressure, the Secretary of
                            State said, he felt that something must be done to clear the atmosphere;
                            we must get back to fundamentals; and these fundamentals were embodied
                            in the proposal presented by this Government to the Japanese on November
                            26. There was no reason for conflict between the United States and
                            Japan. There was no real clash of essential interests. Japan did not
                            have to use a sword to gain for itself a seat at the head table. In our
                            opinion equality of opportunity was the key to the future peace and
                            prosperity of all nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that the document handed to the Ambassador on November 26
                            had been communicated to the Japanese Government and a reply would be
                            forthcoming in a few days. He added that the Japanese Government
                            believed that its proposal of November 20 was equitable and gave full
                            consideration to the points of view of both countries; that the Japanese
                            Government had difficulty in understanding the position taken by the
                            Government of the United States; and that the American proposal given to
                            the Japanese representatives on November 26 seemed to fail to take into
                            account the existing conditions in the Far East. He said that the
                            Japanese offer to withdraw its troops from southern French Indochina
                            remained standing and that Japan had shown its extreme desire to promote
                            a peaceful settlement. He was directed, he continued, by the Japanese
                            Government to inquire what was the ultimate aim of the United States in
                            the conversations and to ask the Government of the United States to
                            “make deep reflection of this matter”.</p>

                            present, the Secretary of State emphasized the critical nature of the
                            relations of this country with Japan: he stated at those meetings that
                            there was practically no possibility of an agreement being achieved with
                            Japan; that in his opinion the Japanese were likely to break out at any
                            time with new acts of conquest by force; <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                                facs="0444"/>and that the question of safeguarding our national
                            security was in the hands of the Army and the Navy. At the conclusion
                            the Secretary with due deference expressed his judgment that any plan
                            for our military defense should include an assumption that the Japanese
                            might make the element of surprise a central point in their strategy and
                            also might attack at various points simultaneously with a view to
                            demoralizing efforts of defense and of coordination for purposes
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Final Phase</hi></p>
                        <p>50. During the final phase of these conversations, the Government of the
                            United States learned that new contingents of Japanese armed forces and
                            additional equipment were moving into Indochina. Toward the end of
                            November these movements were intensified. During the first week of
                            December new movements of Japanese forces made it clear that under cover
                            of negotiations such forces were being disposed for some attack on
                            unspecified objectives. These disposals included moving into strategic
                            positions in the Gulf of Thailand. That disposal was apparently designed
                            not merely to intimidate or assault Thailand but also to set up bases
                            for attack southward against Singapore and northward in the direction of
                            the Burma Road.</p>
                        <p>51. On December 2 the President in a memorandum to the Secretary and the
                            Under Secretary of State directed that inquiry be made at once of the
                            Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu in regard to the reasons for the
                            continued Japanese troop movements into Indochina. On the same date the
                            Under Secretary of State, in compliance with the President’s
                            instruction, informed the Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu of the
                            President’s inquiry.</p>
                        <p>52. On December 5 the Japanese Ambassador called and handed to the
                            Secretary of State a reply to that inquiry, the substantive portion of
                            which reply read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As Chinese troops have recently shown frequent signs of
                                    movements along the northern frontier of French Indo-china
                                    bordering on China, Japanese troops, with the object of mainly
                                    taking precautionary measures, have been reinforced to a certain
                                    extent in the northern part of French Indo-china. As a natural
                                    sequence of this step, certain movements have been made among
                                    the troops stationed in the southern part of the said territory.
                                    It seems that an exaggerated report has been made of these
                                    movements. It should be added that no measure has been taken on
                                    the part of the Japanese Government that may transgress the
                                    stipulations of the Protocol of Joint Defense between Japan and
                                    France.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>53. On this occasion the Secretary of State said to the Japanese
                            Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu that he, the Secretary, had been under the
                            impression that Japan had been moving forces into northern Indochina <pb
                                n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0445"/>for the purpose of <hi

                            heard before that these troop movements were for the purpose of defense
                            against Chinese attack. He added that it was the first time he had been
                            given to understand that Japan was on the defensive in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the United States blames Japan for its move into
                            Indochina but that if Indochina were controlled by other powers it would
                            be a menace to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we could resolve the difficulties without delay
                            if the Japanese Government would renounce courses of force and
                            aggression. He added that we were not looking for trouble but that at
                            the same time we were not running away from menaces.</p>
                        <p>Despite the completely unsatisfactory Japanese reply with respect to its
                            operations in Indochina, the United States Government still felt that
                            every possible effort for peace should be exhausted. President Roosevelt
                            on December 6 telegraphed to Tokyo a personal message to the Emperor of
                            Japan in which he stated that developments were occurring in the Pacific
                            area which threatened to deprive the United States and Japan and all
                            humanity of the beneficial influence of the long peace between the two
                            countries, and that these developments contained “tragic possibilities”.
                            The President said that we had hoped that the peace of the Pacific could
                            be consummated in such a way that many diverse peoples could exist side
                            by side without fear of invasion, that unbearable burdens of armaments
                            could be lifted, and that all peoples would resume commerce without
                            discrimination against or in favor of any nation. In seeking these great
                            objectives both Japan and the United States “should agree to eliminate
                            any form of military threat”. The President said further that during
                            recent weeks it had become clear to the world that Japanese military,
                            naval, and air forces had been sent to southern Indochina in such large
                            numbers as to create a reasonable doubt that this continued
                            concentration in Indochina was defensive in its character; that the
                            people of the Philippines, of the Netherlands Indies, of Malaya, and of
                            Thailand were asking themselves whether these Japanese forces were
                            preparing or intending to make attack in one or more of these many
                            directions; that none of these peoples could sit either indefinitely or
                            permanently “on a keg of dynamite”. Finally, the President said that he
                            was addressing the Emperor in the fervent hope that the Emperor might
                            give thought to ways of dispelling the darkening clouds; that both he
                            and the Emperor had “a sacred duty to restore traditional amity and
                            prevent further death and destruction in the world”.</p>
                        <p>54. On Sunday, December 7, at about 12:00 noon, the Secretary of State,
                            in response to a telephoned request from the Japanese Ambassador, <pb
                                n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0446"/>made an appointment to receive
                            the Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu at 1 p.m. Shortly after 1 p.m. the
                            Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu asked by telephone that the appointment be
                            postponed until 1:45 p.m. They arrived at the Department of State at
                            2:05 p.m. and were received by the Secretary at 2:20 p.m. The Japanese
                            Ambassador said that he had been instructed by his Government to deliver
                            a paper at one p.m. but that difficulty in decoding the message had
                            delayed him. He then handed the Secretary a document, the text of which
                            read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. The Government of Japan, prompted by a genuine desire to come
                                    to an amicable understanding with the Government of the United
                                    States in order that the two countries by their joint efforts
                                    may secure the peace of the Pacific Area and thereby contribute
                                    toward the realization of world peace, has continued
                                    negotiations with the utmost sincerity since April last with the
                                    Government of the United States regarding the adjustment and
                                    advancement of Japanese-American relations and the stabilization
                                    of the Pacific Area.</p>
                                <p>“The Japanese Government has the honor to state frankly its views
                                    concerning the claims the American Government has persistently
                                    maintained as well as the measures the United States and Great
                                    Britain have taken toward Japan during these eight months.</p>
                                <p>“2. It is the immutable policy of the Japanese Government to
                                    insure the stability of East Asia and to promote world peace and
                                    thereby to enable all nations to find each its proper place in
                                    the world.</p>
                                <p>“Ever since China Affair broke out owing to the failure on the
                                    part of China to comprehend Japan’s true intentions, the
                                    Japanese Government has striven for the restoration of peace and
                                    it has consistently exerted its best efforts to prevent the
                                    extension of war-like disturbances. It was also to that end that
                                    in September last year Japan concluded the Tripartite Pact with
                                    Germany and Italy.</p>
                                <p>“However, both the United States and Great Britain have resorted
                                    to every possible measure to assist the Chungking régime so as
                                    to obstruct the establishment of a general peace between Japan
                                    and China, interfering with Japan’s constructive endeavours
                                    toward the stabilization of East Asia. Exerting pressure on the
                                    Netherlands East Indies, or menacing French Indo-China, they
                                    have attempted to frustrate Japan’s aspiration to the ideal of
                                    common prosperity in cooperation with these regions.
                                    Furthermore, when Japan in accordance with its protocol with
                                    France took measures of joint defence of French Indo-China, both
                                    American and British Governments, willfully misinterpreting it
                                    as a threat to their own possessions, and inducing the
                                    Netherlands Government to follow suit, they enforced the assets
                                    freezing order, thus severing economic relations with Japan.
                                    While manifesting thus an obviously hostile attitude, these
                                    countries have strengthened their military preparations
                                    perfecting an encirclement of Japan, and have brought about a
                                    situation which endangers the very existence of the Empire.</p>
                                <p>“Nevertheless, to facilitate a speedy settlement, the Premier of
                                    Japan proposed, in August last, to meet the President of the
                                    United States for a discussion of important problems between the
                                    two countries covering the entire Pacific Area. However, the
                                    American <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0447"/>Government,
                                    while accepting in principle the Japanese proposal, insisted
                                    that the meeting should take place after an agreement of view
                                    had been reached on fundamental and essential questions.</p>
                                <p>“3. Subsequently, on September 25th the Japanese Government
                                    submitted a proposal based on the formula proposed by the
                                    American Government, taking fully into consideration past
                                    American claims and also incorporating Japanese views. Repeated
                                    discussions proved of no avail in producing readily an agreement
                                    of view. The present cabinet, therefore, submitted a revised
                                    proposal, moderating still further the Japanese claims regarding
                                    the principal points of difficulty in the negotiation and
                                    endeavoured strenuously to reach a settlement. But the American
                                    Government, adhering steadfastly to its original assertions,
                                    failed to display in the slightest degree a spirit of
                                    conciliation. The negotiation made no progress.</p>
                                <p>“Therefore, the Japanese Government, with a view to doing its
                                    utmost for averting a crisis in Japanese-American relations,
                                    submitted on November 20th still another proposal in order to
                                    arrive at an equitable solution of the more essential and urgent
                                    questions which, simplifying its previous proposal, stipulated
                                    the following points: <list>
                                        <item>“(1) The Governments of Japan and the United States
                                            undertake not to dispatch armed forces into any of the
                                            regions, excepting French Indo-China, in the

                                    restoration of Sino-Japanese peace when the two parties have

                                    to Chiang Kai-shek; and in spite of its suggestion mentioned

                                    persistently maintained, the American Government made a proposal
                                    totally ignoring Japanese claims, which is a source of profound
                                    regret to the Japanese Government.</p>
                                <p>“4. From the beginning of the present negotiation the Japanese
                                    Government has always maintained an attitude of fairness and
                                    moderation, and did its best to reach a settlement, for which it
                                    made all possible concessions often in spite of great
                                    difficulties. As for the China question which constituted an
                                    important subject of the negotiation, the Japanese Government
                                    showed a most conciliatory attitude. As for the principle of
                                    non-discrimination in international commerce, advocated by the
                                    American Government, the Japanese Government expressed its
                                    desire to see the said principle applied throughout the world,
                                    and declared that along with the actual practice of this
                                    principle in the world, the Japanese Government would endeavour
                                    to apply the same in the Pacific Area including China, and made
                                    it clear that Japan had no intention of excluding from China
                                    economic activities of third powers pursued on an equitable
                                    basis. Furthermore, as regards the question of withdrawing
                                    troops from French Indo-China, the Japanese Government even
                                    volunteered, as mentioned above, to carry out an immediate
                                    evacuation of troops from Southern French Indo-China as a
                                    measure of easing the situation.</p>
                                <p>“It is presumed that the spirit of conciliation exhibited to the
                                    utmost degree by the Japanese Government in all these matters is
                                    fully appreciated by the American Government.</p>
                                <p>“On the other hand, the American Government, always holding fast
                                    to theories in disregard of realities, and refusing to yield an
                                    inch on its impractical principles, caused undue delay in the
                                    negotiation. It is difficult to understand this attitude of the
                                    American Government and the Japanese Government desires to call
                                    the attention of the American Government especially to the
                                    following points: <list>
                                        <item>“1. The American Government advocates in the name of
                                            world peace those principles favorable to it and urges
                                            upon the Japanese Government the acceptance thereof. The
                                            peace of the world may be brought about only by
                                            discovering a mutually acceptable formula through
                                            recognition of the reality of the situation and mutual
                                            appreciation of one another’s position. An attitude such
                                            as ignores realities and imposes one’s selfish views
                                            upon others will scarcely serve the purpose of
                                            facilitating the consummation of negotiations.</item>

                                            is ready to accept in principle, but in view of the
                                            world’s actual conditions, it seems only a Utopian ideal
                                            on the part of the American Government to attempt to
                                            force their immediate adoption.</item>

                                            Thailand, which is patterned after the old concept of

                                            has been proposed with a view to restrain Japan from
                                            fulfilling its obligations under the Tripartite Pact

                                            extension of the war. While it seeks, on the one hand,
                                            to secure its rear by stabilizing the Pacific Area, it
                                            is engaged, on the other hand, in aiding Great Britain

                                            international issues through military pressure, it is
                                            exercising in conjunction with Great Britain and other

                                            relations should be condemned as it is at times more

                                        <item>“4. It is impossible not to reach the conclusion that
                                            the American Government desires to maintain and

                                            counter to Japan’s fundamental policy to enable all
                                            nations to enjoy each its proper place in the

                                            unconditional application of the principle of
                                            nondiscrimination in international commerce ignored the
                                            actual conditions of China, and are calculated to
                                            destroy Japan’s position as the stabilizing factor of
                                            East Asia. The attitude of the American Government in
                                            demanding Japan not to support militarily, politically
                                            or economically any régime other than the régime at
                                            Chungking, disregarding thereby the existence of the
                                            Nanking Government, shatters the very basis of the
                                            present negotiation. This demand of the American
                                            Government falling, as it does, in line with its
                                            above-mentioned refusal to cease from aiding the
                                            Chungking régime, demonstrates clearly the intention of
                                            the American Government to obstruct the restoration of
                                            normal relations between Japan and China and the return
                                            of peace to East Asia.</item>

                                <p>“5. In brief, the American proposal contains certain acceptable
                                    items such as those concerning commerce, including the
                                    conclusion of a trade agreement, mutual removal of the freezing
                                    restrictions, and stabilization of yen and dollar exchange, or
                                    the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China. On the other
                                    hand, however, the proposal in question ignores Japan’s
                                    sacrifices in the four years of the China Affair, menaces the
                                    Empire’s existence itself and disparages its honour and
                                    prestige. Therefore, viewed in its entirety, the Japanese
                                    Government regrets that it cannot accept the proposal as a basis
                                    of negotiation.</p>
                                <p>“6. The Japanese Government, in its desire for an early
                                    conclusion of the negotiation, proposed simultaneously with the
                                    conclusion of the Japanese-American negotiation, agreements to
                                    be signed with Great Britain and other interested countries. The
                                    proposal was accepted by the American Government. However, since
                                    the American Government has made the proposal of November 26th
                                    as a result of frequent consultation with Great Britain,
                                    Australia, the Netherlands and Chungking, and presumably by
                                    catering to the wishes of the Chungking régime in the questions
                                    of China, it must be concluded that all these countries are at
                                    one with the United States in ignoring Japan’s position.</p>
                                <p>“7. Obviously it is the intention of the American Government to
                                    conspire with Great Britain and other countries to obstruct
                                    Japan’s efforts toward the establishment of peace through the
                                    creation of a new order in East Asia, and especially to preserve
                                    Anglo-American rights and interests by keeping Japan and China
                                    at war. This intention has been revealed clearly during the
                                    course of the present negotiation. Thus, the earnest hope of the
                                    Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American relations and to
                                    preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through
                                    cooperation with the American Government has finally been
                                    lost.</p>
                                <p>“The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the
                                    American Government that in view of the attitude of the American
                                    Government it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach
                                    an agreement through further negotiations.”</p>

                        <p>Several hours after the beginning of the Japanese attack Ambassador Grew
                            was informed by the Japanese Foreign Minister that the above-described
                            memorandum, which had been delivered at Washington, was desired by the
                            Emperor to be regarded as the Emperor’s reply to the President’s
                            message. At the same time, however, the Japanese Foreign Minister made
                            an oral statement to the Ambassador also “as a reply” from the Emperor
                            to the President to the effect that the establishment of peace “in the
                            Pacific and consequently of the world has been the cherished desire of
                            His Majesty for the realization of which he has hitherto made the
                            Government to continue its earnest endeavors”.</p>
                        <p>56. In entering into the conversations with the Japanese Government in
                            the spring of 1941 this Government had had in mind doing everything it
                            could to bring about a peaceful, fair and stabilizing settlement of the
                            situation throughout the Pacific area. This course was in accordance
                            with the traditional beliefs and attitude of the American people. It was
                            also consistent with the need of having time to build up the
                            preparations for defense vital not only to the United States but to many
                            other countries resisting aggression. Throughout the course of the
                            conversations, the representatives of this Government had of necessity
                            to consider whether the Japanese Government had the willingness and the
                            power to enter into in good faith an agreement of a character which
                            would be likely to contribute to the establishment of just and stable
                            conditions of peace in the Pacific area. Even though from the outset of
                            the conversations the prospects of success appeared at best to be but
                            slight, the representatives of this Government felt that they must make
                            every possible effort to preserve and promote peace. In this spirit they
                            continued to try to obtain some reliable indication that there was or
                            could be a meeting of the minds and that formal negotiations either at a
                            meeting between the responsible heads of the two Governments or through
                            normal diplomatic channels would bring forth specific and dependable
                            pledges. <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0452"/>While considering it
                            necessary, in the light of Japan’s past and contemporary record of
                            aggression, to subject all Japanese proposals to most careful scrutiny
                            and analysis, and to be constantly on guard against qualified and
                            equivocal offers and declarations, the representatives of this
                            Government had endeavored at all times to treat with the Japanese in a
                            spirit of open-mindedness, patience and good-will. At the same time this
                            Government had consistently declined to compromise the principles in
                            which the people of this country believe and to which they and this
                            Government are committed.</p>
                        <p>The desire and effort of the United States to maintain peaceful relations
                            with Japan and to improve and stabilize on a just basis the situation
                            throughout the Pacific area were frustrated by the determination of
                            Japan to continue its march on the pathway of conquest. Japan’s leaders
                            had committed their country to a carefully formulated program for the
                            subjugation and ruthless exploitation of at least one-half of the
                            world’s population. The attack by Japan’s armed forces upon the United
                            States on December 7 showed conclusively that the military element in
                            Japan had gained complete control of the Japanese Government and was
                            able to override all persons and groups desirous of restoring good
                            relations with the United States and of diverting their country from
                            courses of aggression to courses of peace. That attack brought to an
                            unsuccessful end the intensive effort which the American Government had
                            made to preserve peace.</p>

                        <p>I accompanied the new Japanese Ambassador<note n="13" xml:id="d238fn13"
                                >Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura.</note> to the President’s office and
                            sat through the conference between the President and the Ambassador. The
                            President received the Ambassador in a marked spirit of cordiality and
                            personal friendliness. He referred in pleasing language to their
                            association some twenty-odd years ago, and remarked that he proposed to
                            call him Admiral and consider him as Admiral, rather than as Ambassador.
                            He said that they were friends and they could at all times talk candidly
                            as friends about the relations and related affairs of the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that of course it is manifest that the present
                            relations between the two countries are not good; that they are in fact
                            getting worse, or to use a well-known expression, they are
                            “deteriorating”; that the press of Japan—and he said the press of our
                            country might not be an exception—expresses views and circulates reports
                            which are calculated to arouse feeling in this country of 130,000,000
                            population; that some of the Japanese statesmen talk along similar
                            lines, and that altogether the American people are quite seriously
                            concerned about the Japanese situation. The President affirmed two or
                            three times the view that the American people, while not bitter as yet,
                            are thoroughly and seriously concerned and to a more or less increasing
                            extent, at the course of Japan.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to the movements of Japan southward down to Indochina
                            and the Spratly Islands and other localities in that area,<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d238fn14"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_277"
                                    >pp. 277</ref> ff.</note> as having given this country <hi
                                rend="italic">very</hi> serious concern. He said that the entry of
                            Japan into the Tripartite agreement<note n="15" xml:id="d238fn15"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_165">p.
                                165</ref>.</note> is likewise giving this country the same serious
                            concern, especially from the viewpoint that Japan is supposed to have
                            divested herself of her sovereign authority to deal with the question of
                            peace and war and to leave it to the Tripartite signatories led by
                            Germany. The President went over this the second time with increased
                            emphasis as to the heavy signs of concern it had created among the
                            American people. He then said that while the American people are
                            peace-minded and peace-loving and peace-observing, and are not unduly

                            regardless of the exact facts or details as to the cause …</p>
                        <p>The President more than once referred with gratification to the fact that
                            the present Ambassador is here and that the two of them could in the
                            friendliest and frankest manner talk out to the best advantage of both
                            countries ways and means of dealing with such inflammable circumstances
                            and with methods to avoid them. He then said that in view of all these
                            serious conditions which are becoming increasingly worse and which
                            seriously call for attention, it occurred to him that the Japanese
                            Ambassador might find it advisable and agreeable as he, the President,
                            does, to sit down with the Secretary of State and other State Department
                            officials and review and reexamine the important phases of the relations
                            between the two countries, at least during the past four or five years,
                            and frankly discuss all of their phases and ascertain just when and how
                            points of divergence developed and their effects, and bring the whole
                            situation in these respects up to date in order to see if our relations
                            could not be improved. The President said there is plenty of room in the
                            Pacific area for everybody, and he repeated this statement with
                            emphasis. The Ambassador showed no signs of dissent, but somewhat the
                            contrary. The President elaborated a little in order to emphasize this
                            suggestion. The Ambassador bowed and indicated his assent, just as he
                            bowed in an apparently wholehearted and agreeable manner when the
                            President referred to the dangerous situation between the two
                            countries—the <hi rend="italic">Panay</hi> incident and the Tripartite
                            agreement. One would have thought from his demeanor and manifestations
                            that the Ambassador was in entire harmony with each point the President
                            brought out, including the reexamination of the record of relations
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The President finally said it would not do this country any good nor
                            Japan any good, but both of them harm, to get into a war. The Ambassador
                            gave his prompt assent to this.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, having passed in his formal address and the President
                            having laid his reply and address aside, proceeded to speak with every
                            appearance of earnestness about preserving peaceful relations between
                            the two countries. He referred to the military group in control as
                            “Chauvinistic” and he used another similar word to characterize this
                            element without mentioning it by name, but referring to it as presenting
                            the chief difficulty and chief obstacle to the pursuit <pb n="389"
                                xml:id="pg_389" facs="0455"/>of the course which the Ambassador and
                            those of his views would be disposed to follow, which course was
                            presumably one that would be acceptable to this country. The Ambassador
                            said that every part of his being would be behind his best possible
                            efforts to promote and preserve peaceful and agreeable relations and a
                            better understanding between the two countries. He left the impression
                            that his Government was in harmony with his purpose thus so earnestly
                            expressed. He made no reference to the points the President brought out,
                            but spoke briefly in a general way about the existence of unsatisfactory
                            relations; the need for their improvement and his every disposition to
                            say and do anything possible to that end.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at my apartment at the Carlton Hotel by an
                            indirect arrangement based on the equal and joint initiative of himself
                            and myself growing out of his talk with the President in my presence
                            some days ago. I expressed my satisfaction and interest at his coming
                            and he said that he had been watching for an opportunity to talk with
                            me. The idea evidently was that he was seeking to do this without
                            appearing to take the initiative in the conference.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I was not absolutely certain whether he would come; that
                            at all times most countries have some responsible, fine and capable
                            citizens who are seeking earnestly and patriotically to make their
                            respective contributions to better understanding and other desirable
                            relations between their own and other governments; that in the instant
                            situation I deeply appreciate their purposes and their efforts and have
                            sent word to them to that effect. I have also made it clear that on all
                            official questions and problems between our Governments I can only deal
                            with and through him, the duly authorized Ambassador of Japan, and that
                            much as I appreciate their efforts, this must be the course and attitude
                            of my Government. I made this very definite so that the Ambassador could
                            not misunderstand me. I also said to the Ambassador that I had likewise
                            sent word to these good people from his country that I could not confer
                            with them individually relative to these matters pending between our two
                            Governments unless the Ambassador assumed the responsibility and the
                            initiative to that end; that, in other words, everything must come and
                            go through him, the Ambassador of Japan. He merely bowed each time I
                            referred to the matter without saying anything.</p>
                        <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>Some casual remark then offered the occasion for me to refer to our
                            program of liberal commercial policy and trade agreements and the
                            extreme need for its adoption by all important nations. I reviewed in
                            some detail the course of extreme nationalism during the post-war period
                            and how each nation had sought to live unto itself, blocking the maximum
                            of imports by arbitrary methods of every kind with the result that the
                            sum total of international trade was far below what the annual increase
                            during the past twenty years should have made it; that the processes of
                            distribution and consumption were hopelessly hobbled and handicapped;
                            that as a result world consumption fell at least twenty billions below
                            what it should have legitimately been; that unemployment correspondingly
                            spread in almost every part of the world, with resultant privations,
                            distress and hunger, so that peoples in many countries became a prey to
                            agitators and those seeking dictatorships while the peaceful nations
                            were stagnant and cursed with large dammed up surpluses of their own
                            with nowhere to sell them. I said it was against this movement of what
                            would ultimately be utter disaster that I and others strove for many
                            years in an effort to prevail on important nations to join in a liberal
                            commercial program for vastly increased production and healthy trade in
                            all parts of the world; but that the movement had been just a little too
                            late for us to prevail, especially on Europe, to get in and actively aid
                            in advancing this movement of economic restoration on a sound healthy
                            basis. I said that we were struggling to get forty nations actively and
                            earnestly behind this movement based on equality of treatment and
                            equality of access to raw materials, so that we could then turn to
                            countries like Germany and Italy and let the forty nations assure them
                            that they would be welcome into this program of trade opportunity and
                            trade equality.</p>
                        <p>I said that, unfortunately, this sound healthy movement was interrupted
                            by military movements and plans and undertakings; that conquest by force
                            accompanied by virtual military rule of conquered peoples, with all of
                            its elements of semi-barbarism, seemed to effectively block for the time
                            being the movement for peaceful commerce and increased consumption and
                            employment throughout most of the world. I said this policy and this
                            movement of my Government are, of course, well known to every government
                            and every statesman in the world; that in our efforts to ward off any
                            pretext for military adventures for purposes of conquest and arbitrary
                            domination of other nations economically, politically or militarily, we
                            for years strove to the utmost not only to advance and secure the
                            acceptance generally of a sound liberal commercial policy and
                            ever-increasing international trade, but along with it the other
                            fundamentals which underlie all other important relations among
                            civilized nations and with which everyone <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391"
                                facs="0457"/>is familiar; that that was our objective and our
                            effort; that these efforts conducted vigorously for many years under
                            this Administration were well known to everybody.</p>
                        <p>I then said that it would be impossible to describe our surprise and deep
                            disappointment to see a number of nations abandon this peaceful course
                            of understanding and adjustment in accordance with basic rules and laws
                            and policies and move straight in the direction of fastening on the
                            world the opposite and opposing policy of military conquest by force,
                            and threat of force, and the adoption of methods of government of the
                            conquered peoples that are a reversion to those extremely and
                            unspeakably vicious methods of arbitrary rulers and despots of many
                            centuries ago.</p>
                        <p>I said, therefore, that I am glad to have the Ambassador come in in the
                            hope that he may have something definite and systematic in mind that
                            would offer a practical approach to and consideration of the course and
                            attitude of his Government with respect to its present course.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed much interest in what I said about attempts to
                            organize the world on a liberal commercial basis and indicated his
                            whole-hearted approval. He said that his Government, like others at
                            times, may have made some mistakes, and he added that all of the people
                            in Japan with very few exceptions, which included extremists, were very
                            much averse to getting into war with the United States; that he had
                            talked with them generally and this included most of the military
                            officials, but not all of them; that Prime Minister Konoye is not one of
                            the latter type, and is not desirous of moving on such a course as I had
                            mentioned and criticized, namely a course of military expansion; that
                                Matsuoka<note n="17" xml:id="d239fn17">Yosuke Matsuoka, Japanese
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> is a politician and the
                            Ambassador smiled and said that he sometimes uses big words. The
                            Ambassador said that the talk of Matsuoka and other statesmen in Japan
                            along the lines I complained of was really for home consumption. The
                            Ambassador then said that his Government would be very glad to effect
                            peace arrangements with China and hoped that at no distant date such
                            terms might be developed as would give consideration to their puppet
                            government, and would move Chiang Kai-shek<note n="17a"
                                xml:id="d239fn17a">President of the Executive Yüan and Chairman of
                                the Military Affairs Commission of China.</note> to come into the
                            picture and participate in general peaceful arrangements with China,
                            which the Ambassador emphasized as his country’s desire, and which
                            should be on the basis of equality to all nations. In response to
                            inquiries as to further details of the proposed Chinese-Japanese peace
                            or the methods of bringing it about, the Ambassador was silent for the
                            present, but indicated that his <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0458"
                            />adviser, Colonel Iwakuro, is on his way here and that he had intimate
                            details of the whole Chinese-Japanese situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that it would be well-nigh unthinkable for our
                            two countries to fight each other on account of the destructive effects
                            that would inevitably result in any event. I here spoke and said that my
                            country entertained the same idea about the destructive effects of a
                            military clash between our two countries. I then inquired of the
                            Ambassador whether the military groups in control of his Government
                            could possibly expect important nations like the United States to sit
                            absolutely quiet while two or three nations before our very eyes
                            organized naval and military forces and went out and conquered the
                            balance of the earth, including the seven seas and all trade routes and
                            the other four continents. Could they expect countries like mine to
                            continue to remain complacent as that movement is going on? I inquired
                            further what countries like mine would have to gain by remaining
                            complacent in the face of a movement to substitute force and conquest
                            for law and justice and order and fair dealing and equality. The
                            Ambassador sought to play down the view that such military conquest was
                            really in the mind of his Government and he then said that embargoes by
                            this country were, of course, of increasing concern, and that he did not
                            believe there would be any further military movements unless the policy
                            of increasing embargoes by this country should force his Government, in
                            the minds of those in control, to take further military steps. To this I
                            replied that this is a matter entirely in the hands of his Government
                            for the reason that his Government took the initiative in military
                            expansion and seizures of territory of other countries, thereby creating
                            an increasingly deep concern on the part of my own and other countries
                            as to the full extent of Japanese conquest by force which was
                            contemplated; that my country has not been at fault and none of the
                            nations engaged in conquest have pretended seriously to charge it with
                            any action of omission or commission in relation to the present movement
                            of world conquest by force on the part of some three nations, including
                            Japan. The Ambassador sought here to minimize and mildly to controvert
                            the idea that Japan is engaged in broad unqualified military conquest. I
                            then repeated the terms of the Tripartite Agreement and the public
                            declaration of Hitler and Matsuoka and other high authorities in Japan
                            to the effect that their countries under the Tripartite arrangement were
                            out by military force to establish a new order not for Asia alone, not
                            for Europe alone, but for the world, and a new order under their
                            control. I said that whatever interpretation the Ambassador might give
                            these utterances and military activities in harmony with them thus far,
                            the American people who were long complacent with respect to dangerous
                            international developments <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0459"/>have
                            of late become very thoroughly aroused and awakened to what they regard
                            as a matter of most serious concern in relation to movements by Japan
                            and Germany, presumably to take charge of the seas and the other
                            continents for their own personal arbitrary control and pecuniary profit
                            at the expense of the welfare of all of the peoples, who are victims of
                            such a course and of peaceful nations in general. I said, of course,
                            these apprehensions and this tremendous concern will remain and continue
                            so long as Hitler continues his avowed course of unlimited conquest and
                            tyrannical rule and so long as the Japanese Army and Navy increase their
                            occupation by force of other and distant areas on both land and sea,
                            with no apparent occasion to do so other than that of capture and
                            exclusive use of the territory and other interests of other countries.
                            The Ambassador again sought to allay the idea of military conquest on
                            the part of his country, and I again replied with emphasis that as long
                            as Japanese forces were all over China and Japanese troops and airplanes
                            and naval vessels were as far south as Thailand and Indochina and
                            Saigon, accompanied by such threatening declarations as Japanese
                            statesmen are making week after week, there can only be increasing
                            concern by nations who are vitally interested in international affairs
                            both on land and sea as they are also vitally interested in the halt of
                            world conquest by force and barbaric methods of government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador came back again to the desire of his country for peace
                            with China based on equality to all and the hope that it might combine
                            something of their puppet government with Chiang Kai-shek’s government.
                            I pressed the Ambassador to indicate some further definite ideas he
                            might have in mind about the proper steps to take to approach the whole
                            situation. He did not disagree with me when I spoke of the necessity for
                            acts and utterances by Japan, making it clear that in good faith she was
                            not pursuing or intending to pursue a course of expansion and conquest
                            by force, such as had been referred to.</p>
                        <p>I said that I came from the President who sent his regards and said that
                            he would be only too glad at any time to talk further with the
                            Ambassador just as two old friends would talk, and do so officially and
                            unofficially, or individually at times, if desired by either. I pointed
                            out that such a meeting could be arranged unobtrusively and without
                            publicity, and in a manner permitting the initiative to be shared on a
                            50–50 basis between him and the President. The Ambassador said he might
                            call on the President the next time; that he would hope to continue
                            these conversations. On two or three occasions I inquired of him whether
                            it was still agreeable to pursue the President’s suggestion of talking
                            over and discussing the past relations between our two Governments and
                            the questions that have arisen <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0460"
                            />which call for settlement by mutual agreement. He indicated his
                            favorable disposition in regard to the matter, but not in any specific
                            way as to time or as to officials with whom he might talk.</p>
                        <p>I referred on one or two occasions to the statement reported to have been
                            made to Mr. Churchill<note n="17b" xml:id="d239fn17b">British Prime
                                Minister.</note> by the Japanese Ambassador in London some days ago
                            to the effect that his Government would not attack Singapore or the
                            Netherlands East Indies, and inquired point-blank what the Ambassador’s
                            idea as to this was. In reply to the first inquiry, he was not
                            exceedingly strong in his statement but he did make it fairly definite
                            that he did not believe there would be an attack but added, as
                            heretofore indicated, that if our American embargoes continued to press
                            his Government and the military group in control, they may feel forced
                            to proceed further in a naval or military way. I again said to him that
                            this latter question would not with any consistency or reason arise, in
                            my judgment, because, as already stated to him, the whole responsibility
                            and initiative with respect to military conquest and the departure from
                            laws and treaties and other basic rules of friendly relationship by the
                            Japanese Government rests entirely on that Government.</p>
                        <p>I again inquired of the Ambassador if he had any further ideas or
                            suggestions which would constitute any plans or purposes for peaceful
                            readjustment additional to that which he had already mentioned in
                            relation to China. The Ambassador did not offer any comment on this
                            except to attempt to convey the impression that later he would give
                            consideration to these further phases.</p>
                        <p>At an appropriate stage in the conversation I said that the conquest of
                            the world by his country and Germany with the methods of government
                            which were being applied to conquered peoples, all bankrupt, would mean
                            to set not only the world but these very conquering countries back to
                            impossible levels of existence; that the conquering countries themselves
                            would be the losers to an unthinkable extent.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation I had occasion to remind the Ambassador
                            that few nations were ever on more mutually profitable and genuine
                            friendly relations than our two countries for two generations lasting
                            until about the time of the Coolidge and Hoover Administrations. I said
                            that, speaking in great confidence, when I came to the State Department,
                            one of my greatest ambitions was to work out a mutually satisfactory
                            arrangement with respect to the Quota Limitation Act of 1924,<note

                            whole matter of immigration on an equal or reciprocal basis, which, of
                            course, would have meant that the number of immigrants both ways would
                            be limited, but this basis of equality would settle <pb n="395"
                                xml:id="pg_395" facs="0461"/>the feeling that has existed since
                            1924. He expressed his gratification at this.</p>
                        <p>I then added that we would get nowhere if the military group should say
                            that they were not expanding in a military way, as they have often said
                            in China, and at the same time go forward with their expansion plans and
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also brought up the question about how the doors of trade
                            had been closed against Japan by other countries, including Indochina,
                            and hence the necessity for some steps looking to the comfortable
                            existence of her people. To this I replied by reminding the Ambassador
                            of what I had said at the outset to the effect that during the twenty
                            years of the post-war period under the reign of extreme nationalism in
                            every country alike, all nations had shut their doors to a large extent
                            against each other, that most nations shut their doors against my
                            country as a part of this universal movement of trade and commercial
                            suicide; that, therefore, Japan is not an exception. I then added that
                            it would be an amazing thing to abandon the whole program of economic
                            rehabilitation on peaceful lines and under the principle of equality, to
                            which I have been referring, and turn away to military force and
                            conquest as a substitute.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether Matsuoka was going to Berlin and the Ambassador said
                            he did not believe he would go, that he had been invited there at the
                            time of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
                        <p>I proceeded to comment on Japan’s line of activities and utterances by
                            saying that this country and most other countries only proclaim and
                            practice policies of peaceful international relationships, political,
                            economic, social and cultural. Sometimes the policy to promote these
                            mutually beneficial relationships is proclaimed, such as our good
                            neighbor policy with special reference to Pan America. And yet all of
                            our acts and programs and policies adopted by the twenty-one American
                            nations in their conferences from time to time are made universal in
                            their application, so that Japan and all other nations receive the same
                            equal opportunities for trade and commerce generally throughout the
                            Americas that each of the American nations receives itself. In striking
                            contrast the new order in greater Eastern Asia is unequivocally believed
                            to be purely a program of military aggression and conquest with entirely
                            arbitrary policies of political, economic and military domination. The
                            Ambassador made no definite promise as to what his Government would do
                            in respect to halting its aggression for purpose of discussions. He did
                            not intimate that it could not and would not do this, no more than he
                            intimated or indicated just what its attitude would be towards the
                            Tripartite Agreement in the future when I definitely brought that phase
                            to his attention in connection with the present and prospective course
                            of the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>During our conversation, I emphasized to the Ambassador that it is the
                            opinion of the President and others of the Administration that the
                            British will beyond any reasonable doubt be able successfully to resist
                            Hitler.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at the White House at his request. The
                            President and I were present at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador proceeded to say that none of his people, with few
                            exceptions, desired war between our two countries; that Matsuoka talks
                            loudly for home consumption because he is ambitious politically, but
                            Japan herself cannot maintain such ambitious plans. He said that Japan
                            desired especially three things in the Chinese situation; the first was
                            good will; the second was economic cooperation; and the third was
                            Comintern defense. He then said that Japan wants raw materials from
                            neighboring countries, and that the “New Order” which contemplates
                            equality of economic opportunity and cooperative prosperity should be
                            given a flexible interpretation. He continued by saying something about
                            the increasingly disastrous situation in Europe, and added that Japan
                            and the United States should cooperate for peace.</p>
                        <p>The President then emphasized very strongly the deep-seated effect on
                            public opinion in this country arising from the Tripartite Agreement,
                            and he proceeded to emphasize vigorously the dangerous effects of this
                            agreement and the utter lack of any sound reason for Japan to enter into
                            it from every standpoint of her welfare. The Ambassador rather lamely
                            remarked that this country was pressing Japan with embargoes and trade
                            restrictions, and they were in a way forced into this Tripartite
                            arrangement. The President controverted this and again said that from
                            every viewpoint this action was contrary to the interest of Japan; that
                            Hitler would rule over every country if once given the opportunity, just
                            as he is today ruling over Italy and the other countries which had
                            trusted him. The Ambassador did not discuss this phase further.</p>
                        <p>Then the question arose regarding the threatening nature of Matsuoka’s
                            acts and utterances, and the Ambassador said that Matsuoka’s trip to
                            Berlin was a mere compliment to the German Government, such as is
                            customary in the existing circumstances for countries like Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President then proceeded to set forth the sound rules and policies of
                            international trade based on the rule of equality of treatment <pb
                                n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0463"/>and elaborated at length with
                            illustrations of the situation facing different countries in various
                            parts of the world. He said that the task would be left to a few
                            important nations like this country and Great Britain, and also Japan if
                            she should be so disposed to reorganize international trade on a sound
                            liberal basis, to cooperate with countries that were weak, or at a
                            disadvantage, to enable them to enjoy all the benefits of economic
                            progress. He said that the United States, for example, desires to aid
                            Brazil to develop her most important lines of production to fit it into
                            the international economic trade situation, and that this country
                            likewise desires to cooperate with Argentina for a like purpose,
                            especially as it relates to Argentine beef and other surplus
                            products.</p>
                        <p>The President then … stressed the close ties existing between Thailand
                            and Japan, adding that the former was more closely related to Japan in
                            many ways than the Argentine was related to the United States. The
                            President said that the suggestion had been made now and then that the
                            United States take over the West Indies, but that the attitude of this
                            Government unreservedly has been to see each country preserve its
                            sovereignty, its territorial integrity and equality of opportunity, and
                            that all the nations of the world can on the same basis come and trade
                            with the nations of this hemisphere. The Ambassador admitted that we had
                            been treating Central and South America extremely well, and that we had
                            developed greatly the good neighbor relationships.</p>
                        <p>The President again returned to the Tripartite Agreement and said that it
                            had upset the American people because they think that a concerted effort
                            is being made by Germany and Italy to reach the Suez Canal and by Japan
                            on the other hand to approach Singapore, the Netherlands East Indies and
                            the Indian Ocean. The Japanese Ambassador spoke more strongly than he
                            had in his earlier talk with me, expressing his belief that his country
                            would not go South.</p>
                        <p>The President came back to the matter of the great work the United States
                            has been doing for economic equality of opportunity, and said that if
                            Great Britain wins, she must be willing for Germany to have equal access
                            to all raw materials and equal trade opportunities. He then remarked
                            that the United States and Japan do not produce rubber and tin and
                            numerous other commodities produced in the British Empire, and that by
                            international arrangements, access to each and all of these must be
                            equal to each country alike. The President illustrated the necessity for
                            this broader course by citing the fact that private efforts had been
                            made to control rubber production and had failed; that control of coffee
                            production had been attempted and had failed.</p>
                        <p>The President finally remarked that, as the Ambassador indicated, matters
                            between our two countries could undoubtedly be worked out <pb n="398"
                                xml:id="pg_398" facs="0464"/>without a military clash, emphasizing
                            that the first step in this direction would be the removal of suspicion
                            and fear regarding Japan’s intentions. I here remarked that, of course,
                            with Matsuoka astride the Axis on his way to Berlin and talking loudly
                            as he goes, and Japanese naval and air forces in the vicinity of
                            Indochina, Thailand and Saigon, with no explanation but with serious
                            inferences, the Ambassador must realize how acute feeling and opinion in
                            this country have become.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Japan had no idea of controlling China … The
                            Ambassador joined with the President a number of times in expressing the
                            view that differences between the countries could and should be worked
                            out. The Ambassador did not, however, respond to requests for any
                            additional methods of approach beyond the Chinese-Japanese question. He
                            did not say so, but I inferred that he would probably be returning in
                            due time for another conference. I made it clear that Japan, having
                            departed from the course that both countries have been pursuing, the
                            initiative and the responsibility are hers to suggest what, how and
                            when, she is willing, as a preliminary step, to undertake serious
                            discussions, and that above all she must make it clear by words and acts
                            of her serious intentions in this direction.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Japan accept joint
                            responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general agreement
                            disposing the resumption of our traditional friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is the
                            sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led to the
                            deterioration of amicable sentiment among our peoples should be
                            prevented from recurrence and corrected in their unforeseen and
                            unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is our present hope that, by a joint effort, our nations may establish
                            a just Peace in the Pacific; and by the rapid consummation of an <hi

                            tragic confusion that now threatens to engulf civilization.</p>
                        <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem ill-suited
                            and weakening. We, therefore, suggest that adequate instrumentalities
                            should be developed for the realization of a general agreement which
                            would bind, meanwhile, both governments in honor and in act.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that such an understanding should comprise only the
                            pivotal issues of urgency and not the accessory concerns which <pb

                            relations if certain situations and attitudes were clarified or

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at my apartment at the Wardman Park Hotel
                            at my request. I stated that as the Ambassador would <pb n="403"
                                xml:id="pg_403" facs="0469"/>recall, both the President and I
                            suggested during our conversations with him that he might care in
                            discussions with me to explore the question of improving relations
                            between the United States and Japan; that such a procedure might involve
                            a review of relations during recent years in an attempt to ascertain
                            where and in what respects the courses of the two countries had
                            diverged; and that this would be done with a view to ascertaining
                            whether something practicable might be done toward restoring the
                            relations of our two countries to that harmonious state which existed
                            for so many decades. I said that I referred to this again at this time
                            because of the reports which have been coming to me that certain of the
                            Ambassador’s compatriots have been working on formulation of proposals
                            and plans for improving relations between the United States and Japan. I
                            had been told that the Ambassador’s compatriots have been in touch with
                            the Ambassador in connection with their proposals and that the
                            Ambassador has participated in and associated himself with these plans.
                            I added that I did, of course, not know whether these reports are
                            entirely accurate and, as mentioned previously to him, we can deal only
                            with the Ambassador in addressing ourselves to consideration of problems
                            outstanding between our two Governments.</p>
                        <p>I then emphasized the point that I had sent for the Ambassador primarily
                            to clear up the matter of the extent of his knowledge of the latest
                                document<note n="18b" xml:id="d242fn18b"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra</hi>.</note> handed to my associates in the State
                            Department by those Americans and Japanese who are collaborating as
                            individuals in an effort to make some sort of contribution to better
                            relations between the two countries, and as to whether it was his desire
                            to present that officially as a first step in negotiations between the
                            two Governments. I again cited those phases previously referred to,
                            which called for preliminary conversation on certain subjects before a
                            stage of negotiations could be reached, and which discouraged the
                            immediate presentation of the document by the Ambassador in an official
                            way. The Ambassador promptly replied that he did know all about this
                            document and that he had collaborated more or less with the individual
                            Japanese and Americans referred to, and that he would be disposed to
                            present it as a basis for negotiations. He proceeded to refer to his
                            great desire to preserve peace between the two countries and therefore
                            to do anything within his power to that end. He emphasized the utter
                            disaster it would be to both countries to go to war, which would last
                            perhaps for many years with the complete exhaustion of all concerned. He
                            spoke strongly expressing the view that his Government did not intend to
                            invade the South Sea area.</p>
                        <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0470"/>
                        <p>We then exchanged some remarks about the general international situation,
                            in which I referred to the fact that it would matter little who wins
                            wars these days unless there is to be a restoration of the principles of
                            justice, order under law, et cetera, which underlie orderly and peaceful
                            international relations, such, for example, as this Government has
                            applied in the upbuilding of the whole fabric of Pan American relations
                            during the past eight years. I elaborated to some extent on the
                            far-reaching improvement in and betterment of all relations between the
                            twenty-one American republics and their respective populations, and
                            concluded by remarking that these same principles could far better be
                            applied in every part of the world, including the Orient than any other
                            doctrines or policies, especially those based on force as an instrument
                            of foreign policy and the intervention in the domestic and internal
                            affairs of one nation or nations by another, and emphasized the view
                            that Japan could well consider the course we had followed instead of the
                            opposite course of force and conquest and arbitrary domination for
                            national aggrandizement. The Ambassador mistook what I said and
                            undertook to go back of the past eight-year period and referred to our
                            difficulties with certain Latin American countries, including Mexico. I
                            soon corrected him and said that this Government had turned over a new
                            leaf, so to speak, especially in 1933 and the following years, in its
                            relations with all nations, including South America. The Ambassador
                            seemed to understand and to get the point. I said that in the present
                            state of world conditions, it was manifest that this war would be
                            followed more or less by chaos and anarchy in international affairs and
                            bankruptcy generally, with the result that new wars would be recurring
                            with increasing frequency in the future. This would be the case unless
                            law-abiding countries should exert every possible effort to prevent wild
                            and reckless groups in every country from dragging the world over the
                            precipice, as was done in many vital respects following the World War
                            when the ablest statesmen in Great Britain, for example, were carrying
                            on a nation-wide campaign on the sole issue of hanging the Kaiser and
                            collecting one hundred billion dollars, or some other fabulous amount,
                            from Germany. I said I desired to repeat that it would not make much
                            difference which way the war goes if such unthinkable conditions of
                            utter destruction are to follow, as is sure to happen, unless
                            safeguarded against by every possible means. The Ambassador commented
                            entirely favorably on this view and emphasized his approval of it.</p>
                        <p>I then said that today it was reported that Hitler is obliged to keep six
                            or eight hundred thousand troops in Poland in order to hold the
                            population in subjugation in every way, which includes <pb n="405"
                                xml:id="pg_405" facs="0471"/>semi-slavery in numerous respects; that
                            the same unquenchable love of liberty that existed in conquered nations
                            throughout Europe still exists; that ninety-nine percent of the people
                            of France, whose liberties have been snuffed out and who have been
                            subjected to every privation and many kinds of ill treatment, are
                            strongly sympathetic with the British cause and its support by the
                            United States as far as is practicable; that all of these conquered
                            peoples are but awaiting the slightest opportunity to throw off the
                            shackles of semi-slavery and destitution, and they can be depended upon
                            to do so, if and when Hitler has some serious reverse or reverses. The
                            Ambassador expressed his acquiescence in this last view without the use
                            of words.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I had observed every phase of Hitler’s conduct and
                            utterances from 1933, each year, each week and each day, and that I, in
                            common with many others, have absolutely no faith in any statement or
                            promise that he makes, but any world, subjected to his methods and his
                            philosophies, which are rooted largely in barbarism, would be an
                            unthinkable world in which to live; that he has no real friends anywhere
                            and that he is not a real friend to anyone; that he would abandon
                            over-night the most solemn obligation taken the day before, if it suited
                            his purpose in the least. I then added that this Government cannot
                            conscientiously sit still and see this unthinkable brand of government
                            fastened on the world; that it wants nothing whatever from anybody,
                            anywhere, but only seeks to aid in preserving an orderly world based on
                            the principles which I have so often recited. The Ambassador did not
                            take issue with this although he did not in any way indicate his
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>Near the close of the conversation I suggested that, having cleared up
                            these preliminary phases for which I sent for him, we could, if desired
                            on his part, proceed at any time with certain preliminary discussions
                            with a view to ascertaining whether there is a basis for negotiations;
                            that for the purpose of this preliminary discussion there would really
                            be no occasion for either side to present officially any completed
                            documents. The Ambassador raised some question as to why such documents
                            might not be presented in the next conversation, and I replied that
                            there were certain points that my Government would desire to raise prior
                            to negotiations, such as questions pertaining to the integrity and
                            sovereignty of China, to the principle of equality of opportunity in
                            China, et cetera; that he could then communicate with his Government and
                            ascertain whether it agrees that there is a basis for negotiations. The
                            Ambassador readily agreed to this view. He emphasized that he had not
                            yet presented this document to his Government or consulted it concerning
                            concrete terms of settlement, but stated that, in his opinion, his
                            Government <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0472"/>would be favorably
                            disposed along such lines as might be made the basis of an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>I said, in conclusion, that I would communicate with the Ambassador later
                            today with a view of agreeing on a time and place for the next
                            conference, adding that it could be at my office or at the White House
                            or in my apartment, although the President was planning on leaving for
                            Warm Springs within a day or two. The Ambassador referred to the
                            interruptions of the press and suggested that he come to my apartment,
                            which he would be ready to do any day from this day on, and he again
                            emphasized the urgency of the situation, saying that events were moving
                            rapidly and that my country is likewise moving rapidly with the result
                            that clashes would become more easily possible from week to week.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at my apartment in accordance with a
                            previous mutual understanding.</p>
                        <p>I asked him what news he had and he proceeded to say that from all he
                            could see and learn, the Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact,<note n="18c"
                                xml:id="d243fn18c">Signed at Moscow, April 13, 1941.</note>
                            announced two days ago, was not really undertaken because of Germany or
                            for Germany’s benefit. I remarked that I had not become unduly concerned
                            about the matter because for some time I have acted on the view that the
                            Soviet policy was not to have war with any country unless in actual
                            self-defense, and that, on the other hand, I did not see wherein Japan
                            could have a policy based on the disposition to attack the Soviet Union.
                            It was one of those circumstances in which I felt that the written
                            document merely reduced to writing the relationships and policies
                            already existing between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I would speak off the record of the fact that, according
                            to official information of today, the British believe that they will
                            safely hold the Egyptian-North African area from German attack. Another
                            item of information coming to me today was that the people, that is the
                            public, in Denmark, are unanimously in favor and support of the action
                            of this Government and their Minister with respect to Greenland.<note

                        <p>With reference to the question of gradually developing a settlement in
                            the Orient, I said that I had been told that the document on which the
                            Ambassador and the private group of individual Americans and <pb n="407"
                                xml:id="pg_407" facs="0473"/>Japanese were collaborating contained
                            numerous proposals with which my Government could readily agree; on the
                            other hand, however, there were others that would require modification,
                            expansion, or entire elimination, and, in addition, there would
                            naturally be some new and separate suggestions by this Government for
                            consideration. I then remarked that the one paramount preliminary
                            question about which my Government is concerned is a definite assurance
                            in advance that the Japanese Government has the willingness and ability
                            to go forward with a plan along the lines of the document we have
                            referred to and the points brought up in our conversation in relation to
                            the problems of a settlement; to abandon its present doctrine of
                            military conquest by force and the taking of title to all property and
                            territories seized, together with the use of force as an instrument of
                            policy; and to adopt the principles which this Government has been
                            proclaiming and practicing as embodying the foundation on which all
                            relations between nations should properly rest.</p>

                                    for its answer through you, as you prefer. You understand that
                                    we both agree that we have in no sense reached the stage of
                                    negotiations; that we are only exploring in a purely preliminary
                                    and unofficial way what action might pave the way for
                                    negotiations later. You tell me that you have not submitted the
                                    document in question to your Government, but that you desire to
                                    do so. Naturally, you are at the fullest liberty to do this,
                                    but, of course, this does not imply any commitment whatever on
                                    the part of this Government with respect to the provisions of
                                    the document in case it should be approved by your Government. I
                                    do, of course, recognize individually that, as stated, if the
                                    Japanese Government should approve this document and instruct
                                    the Ambassador here to propose it to the United States
                                    Government, it would afford a basis for the institution of
                                    negotiations, with the result that this Government would offer
                                    any counter-proposals desired and any independent proposals
                                    desired, which, in conjunction with the Japanese proposal, would
                                    be fully discussed and talked out to a conclusion in one way or
                                    the other in the spirit that unquestionably should and would

                        <p>The Ambassador studied for a few minutes the four points which I handed
                            to him. He then suggested that the principle of equality might well be
                            discussed in connection with the negotiations. I replied promptly that
                            this would be impossible since we could not think of entering into
                            negotiations if his Government should even hesitate in agreeing to this
                            point; that no country in the world would get more from the doctrine of
                            equality, politically, economically, socially and everything worthwhile,
                            than Japan; that the Ambassador knows how successfully this doctrine has
                            operated between the United States and the South American countries, and
                            how successfully this hemisphere has greatly improved the relations
                            between the American republics and improved the conditions of their
                            respective peoples by observing the eight-point program adopted at the

                            development of the program having been initiated at Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon handed to the Ambassador a copy of the eight-point program
                            adopted by the Lima Conference and said that this Government, of course,
                            stands for these principles for the betterment of international
                            relations and is opposed to the doctrine of conquest by force and the
                            seizure and the taking of title by the conqueror which results in the
                            exclusion of all other parts of the world from the conquered areas
                            except by the giving of a preference to Japanese citizens wherever
                            preference would be of any use. I said that throughout any preliminary
                            conversations we have, it must be understood that the foregoing is the
                            well-defined attitude of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador remarked that this country has special relations with
                            South America which Japan in a similar way would not be permitted to
                            have in the Orient. I replied that there was a great misapprehension and
                            misunderstanding about this phase. I said that the truth is that the
                            chief South American countries produce large surpluses of wheat and corn
                            and meat, such as we produce, with the result that we have never had a
                            real trade relationship except to a limited extent; that the total
                            commerce of this hemisphere until lately has only been twenty percent of
                            the world commerce between nations; that eight years ago when I went to
                            Montevideo I sought to institute a system of closer relations between
                            our countries, politically, economically, socially and culturally and
                            otherwise, for all worthwhile purposes … Then I added that Japan could
                            carry on any and all social, educational, economic and political
                            relations with nations in the Pacific with a view to cultivating them,
                            but that it would get nowhere if she should undertake to segregate and
                            surround herself and them by preferences or assert zones of special
                            controlling influence or movements such as are not dreamed of in this
                            country or this hemisphere and which are <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409"
                                facs="0475"/>utterly inimical to the eight principles which were
                            adopted at the Lima Conference.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then remarked that the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                            point No. 4 would interfere with the Manchurian situation. I replied
                            that the question of non-recognition of Manchuria would be discussed in
                            connection with the negotiations and dealt with at that stage, and that
                            this <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> point would not, therefore,
                            affect “Manchukuo,” but was intended to apply to the future from the
                            time of the adoption of a general settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then inquired about the immigration provision. I replied
                            that immigration is considered more of a domestic question in this
                            country; that he would recall my former statement to him to the effect
                            that one of my ambitions when I came to the State Department was to
                            confer with the people of California in particular and undertake to
                            bring about a situation which would make possible the establishment of a
                            reciprocal immigration arrangement with Japan that would be reasonably
                            acceptable to both countries, and that, therefore, Japan would have to
                            accept our good faith in this respect rather than to attempt to make it
                            a part of the proposed negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I was not sure whether the Ambassador fully understood each statement I
                            made in regard to the four points laid before him, and I sought to
                            illustrate by saying to him that the principles underlying a good
                            portion of the proposals in his doctrine were similar to the principles
                            contained in the four points I had handed to him, and that they were an
                            essential part of the eight-point program, which we had recently
                            emphasized in our South American conferences. I added that, if his
                            Government should make up its mind to abandon its present policies of
                            force and invasion, et cetera, and to adopt a peaceful course with
                            worthwhile international relationships, it could find no objection to
                            these four points reasonably applied, nor to the eight points contained
                            in the Lima resolutions; and that, therefore, he could judge the United
                            States attitude toward a Far Eastern settlement in the light of these
                            practices and principles.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador desired me to indicate whether I would to a fairly full
                            extent approve the proposals contained in his document, and I again
                            replied that there would be ready approval of several of them while
                            others would have to be modified or eliminated and this Government would
                            offer some independent proposals, but that if his Government is in real
                            earnest about changing its course, I could see no good reason why ways
                            could not be found to reach a fairly mutually satisfactory settlement of
                            all of the essential questions and problems presented. I illustrated
                            what I meant by the modification of some of the proposals in the
                            document by referring to the fact that the navies of the two countries
                            would not menace each other and adding that the <pb n="410"
                                xml:id="pg_410" facs="0476"/>proposal should be broadened to the
                            effect that no navies of any countries should menace each other in the
                            Pacific or anywhere else, but in this particular instance especially in
                            the Pacific. I said that the doctrine of equality should be very easily
                            agreed upon and inserted in the proposals regarding China, as contained
                            in his document. I referred to the clause in regard to the economic
                            cooperation between Japan and China and said that to avoid the
                            possibility of special preferential arrangements between the two
                            countries, the doctrine of equality should be inserted in that
                            connection. I referred to another proposal in which the two countries
                            would assure each other of supplying such commodities as are available,
                            and added that during the war period this country would be obliged to
                            embargo many commodities from export to any country, but that it would
                            expect to supply the pre-war volume in any event.</p>
                        <p>I said that in connection with the proposals referring to Singapore and
                            Hong Kong, there should be a broader provision to the effect that no
                            nation should construct or operate any agency for the purpose of
                            conquest and aggression.</p>
                        <p>These were illustrations of our wholly informal conversation, in which I
                            sought to get the Ambassador to see what I meant by the statement that
                            some of his other proposals in his document could be accepted, some
                            modified, some rejected, while some new and independent proposals would
                            be made by this Government. The Ambassador seemed not to understand why
                            I could not now agree to some of these proposals in his document. I
                            sought repeatedly to make clear to him, in the first place, that we have
                            not reached the stage of negotiations, he himself agreeing that he thus
                            far has no authority from his Government to negotiate; and in the second
                            place, that if I should thus out of turn agree to a number of important
                            proposals in the document and these proposals should be sent to Japan
                            and the military or extremist groups should ignore them, I and my
                            Government would be very much embarrassed. The Ambassador finally said
                            he fully understood the situation and made clear, I thought, that he
                            would proceed in his own way to consult his Government regarding the
                            four points in the form of a question which I laid before him
                            inferentially with respect to the approval by the Government of his
                            document, by which is meant the document prepared by the group of
                            Americans and Japanese here with the admitted knowledge and more or less
                            cooperation of the Ambassador himself.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then arose and left and I said that if and when he heard
                            from his Government and should then desire a conference, I would be glad
                            for him to advise me at any time.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at my hotel apartment at his request. He
                            spoke promptly and said that he came in to say that, notwithstanding the
                            delays in hearing from his Government in regard to his request for
                            instructions to negotiate with this Government along the lines of the
                            document, which has heretofore been explained, he felt satisfied that he
                            would get a favorable reply from his Government within a few days, and,
                            therefore, he hoped that I would not become impatient. He added that
                            there was politics in the situation back in Japan and implied that this
                            was the cause of the “hitch” in his application for instructions.</p>
                        <p>I did not comment on the matter, but proceeded with one or two general
                            statements in regard to world conditions, and at a convenient point said
                            that we in this country profoundly feel that Hitler and Hitlerism are
                            utterly destructive of everything worthwhile, and that we are determined
                            to see to it that in these circumstances Hitler does not get control of
                            the high seas; that, in the face of this sort of dangerous threat, we
                            have nothing else to do for one, five or ten years except to marshal our
                            resources and see to it that he does not get control of the high seas.
                            The Ambassador, as he often does, smiled and nodded his head in assent.
                            I again repeated, with respect to our relations to Japan and the Pacific
                            area, that it all gets down to the question of whether Japan is willing
                            to move in the direction and on the course outlined by those basic
                            principles of justice and law and equality and fair dealing, such as all
                            nations have practiced much of the time before the present war was
                            started by Hitler. I added that I thought I knew that this was the view
                            of the Ambassador personally. He nodded in assent.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then brought up the question of embargoes and said that
                            this was a rather delicate question with his Government. I replied that
                            it was not nearly as delicate as the extremely harsh treatment his
                            soldiers and his Government have been administering to American
                            nationals and American interests, and that, of course, there was nothing
                            new for me to say on that question.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at my hotel apartment at his request. He
                            first expressed his earnest appreciation of the manner <pb n="412"
                                xml:id="pg_412" facs="0478"/>in which I had dealt with the Japanese
                            situation, especially in refraining from making controversial utterances
                            on the occasion of my meetings with the press from day to day while
                            Matsuoka and others were busily doing so. I made no particular comment
                            on this statement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then proceeded to say that he was also appreciative of the
                            patience which I had displayed in respect to the difficulties he had
                            encountered in his efforts to make progress in these preliminary talks,
                            which difficulties could be traced to certain politicians and others in
                            his country. He then made some references to politicians and Matsuoka
                            with the inference that they were causing the delay and the
                            complications, indicating that the whole matter, having been approved by
                            the Army and the Navy and, if I understood him correctly, by other
                            important Government officials, hinged only on the question of composing
                            their political affairs.</p>
                        <p>If I understood the Ambassador correctly, and I think I did, he tactfully
                            suggested as coming from his Government a non-aggression pact. I did not
                            hesitate but promptly brushed it aside and said that that was an
                            entirely different matter from the principles contained in the
                            Ambassador’s document, and that this Government was not thinking of
                            considering anything except broad principles, such as I had already
                            pointed out, as a basis for any negotiations.</p>
                        <p>He then said he had something in the way of a manuscript either directly
                            or indirectly from Matsuoka. Unless I misunderstood the Ambassador, he
                            disavowed the so-called peace proposals that emanated from
                            Government-inspired sources in Tokyo some days ago. He said that there
                            were many things in the paper “that were wrong”, but that he would be
                            glad to hand it to me, and then inquired if he might do so. I studied a
                            moment and then said that since the paper, as he said, “had many things
                            in it that were wrong”, I felt that, if the Ambassador had the
                            discretionary authority to do so, he might well just retain this paper
                            without delivering it, since, as he indicates, it would seem to negative
                            most or much of his document, and hence no progress could be made along
                            the lines of the Ambassador’s preliminary talks with me and certain of
                            the principles set forth in the document to which he had referred. The
                            Ambassador then proceeded to read some lines of greeting, all of which I
                            could not clearly understand, and wound up on the first half of the
                            first page with what seemed to be a statement of assurance that with
                            just a little more time the whole matter would develop favorably in line
                            with the Ambassador’s document and of his former expressions that his
                            attitude and beliefs represented the attitude of his Government.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I desired first to pay very high tribute to the Ambassador
                            himself for his conscientious and sincere purposes and his <pb n="413"
                                xml:id="pg_413" facs="0479"/>patriotic efforts thus far to bring
                            about a real contribution to more friendly relations between our
                            countries and the mutual benefits which would result therefrom. I said
                            that the Ambassador knows I have been patient thus far and have striven
                            to cooperate to the fullest practical extent with him in his efforts to
                            clear up the political situation at home in order that a stage might be
                            reached where negotiations could be instituted. I then very earnestly
                            proceeded to say that I had striven to be absolutely candid in all of my
                            conversations with the Ambassador, but that I would not be candid if I
                            did not say to him that I could not give any assurances of further
                            patience in the event of further delay for the reason that there were
                            influences that cannot be held back; that this country, as I have
                            heretofore indicated to the Ambassador, is determined that Hitler shall
                            not get control of the high seas; that this means not one sea but the
                            seven seas; that this country, therefore, does not propose to delay all
                            necessary steps of resistance and defense until it is too late; that, as
                            the Ambassador knows, things are moving fast in the direction of
                            resistance, just as Hitler is endeavoring to move fast in his course of
                            continued aggression.</p>
                        <p>I then said that Matsuoka and others in his country have been talking
                            loudly and acting aggressively; such conduct and action were in the
                            opposite direction of the entire spirit and policy of most of the
                            document which the Ambassador had recently sent to his Government for
                            approval and instructions authorizing him to make it a basis for the
                            beginning of negotiations. I said that it is not comprehensible that
                            Matsuoka, for example, could represent his Government in giving
                            utterance to such opposing and threatening expressions while at the same
                            time his Government was supporting the Ambassador here and the
                            principles contained in his document; that the very idea of Matsuoka
                            sending enthusiastic congratulations to Hitler upon the brutal military
                            attack on the poor little country of Greece and its defenseless people
                            presents an attitude and a philosophy that surpasses my
                            comprehension.</p>
                        <p>I said that, in the light of all of these circumstances, the Ambassador
                            must realize clearly the accuracy of my statement to the effect that I
                            cannot be responsible a day longer as to the course of my Government in
                            the face of the expanding aggression of Hitler and of our determination
                            to see to it that he does not get control of any of the seven seas.</p>
                        <p>I then added that the Ambassador undoubtedly understood very clearly
                            that, in this attitude, my Government was acting solely in its necessary
                            self-defense and in defense of its rights and interests, and those of
                            its nationals on the seven seas, just as I would expect Japan to do with
                            respect to its rights and interests and those of its nationals on the
                            seven seas.</p>
                        <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>I stated that I thought we knew Hitler and Hitlerism better than did
                            Matsuoka and those for whom he speaks. We know that if and when he has
                            his way, he will subject every nation to barbaric methods or methods of
                            complete domination, including those, to all appearances, he once in
                            solemn good faith took in as an equal partner, such as Italy; whereas
                            German spies, German agents and German officials largely control the
                            situation in Italy today, and in my judgment will continue to dominate
                            Italy under typical Hitler methods, so long as Hitler retains military
                            power and strength. I said he will administer the same treatment to
                            Japan or to any other country without reference to past relations, if
                            and as it comes within his power and suits his purposes. I reiterated
                            that I thought we knew much more about Hitler than Matsuoka, and we have
                            the experience of seeing fifteen victims of Hitler’s brutality and
                            subjugation, including Italy to the extent indicated, in proof of our
                            appraisal of Hitler and Hitlerism.</p>
                        <p>I said that it must be clear that my country wants absolutely nothing
                            from any country abroad except the maintenance of those relations that
                            are supported by all the basic principles of law, justice, equality, et
                            cetera. We, in this connection, wish respect to be accorded to the
                            territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country, large and small;
                            that, in brief, we stand for the identical six or eight-point program of
                            basic principles, which the United States and Japan maintained to the
                            great advantage of each over a period of seventy-five years; that these
                            are the identical principles we are maintaining as best we can in the
                            difficult circumstances existing throughout the world, and, for
                            illustration, I might point to the policies and principles maintained
                            between us and the South American countries, under which Japan and all
                            countries have equal access to markets and, generally speaking, equal
                            access politically, economically, and in every way; that, of course, if
                            Japan is at all disposed to turn back on this sound and wise course of
                            peace and progress in lieu of a course in the opposite direction, there
                            would be no difficulty in effecting suitable agreements to the former
                            end. I pointed out the great benefits reaped by all countries and the
                            world from such a policy. I added that it is clear, therefore, that
                            wherever we offer resistance to an avowed movement of world aggression
                            by force, such as Hitler’s or any other’s on the high seas or elsewhere,
                            we are acting solely in our necessary self-defense against a world-wide
                            movement of military aggression, and there is no other theory of our
                            attitude that can possibly arise and that would not be false, if and as
                            we proceed to resist whenever and wherever such resistance would be most
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador without talking but a word here and there was constantly
                            bowing and smiling and certainly endeavoring to make me think at least
                            that he was himself approving my statements. In fact, from time to time
                            he would give expression to his approval.</p>
                        <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired about the possibility of an agreement on the
                            policies contained in his document. I thereupon repeated my statements
                            to him in previous conversations to the effect that from what I had
                            heard about his document, a number of his proposals might be agreed to,
                            while others would need to be broadened to the benefit, I thought, of
                            both countries alike, and some new or substitute suggestions would
                            naturally be offered by us. I then said that, of course, the matter of
                            his sending the document to his Government for instructions was for his
                            own judgment to determine, and that, in the meantime, this Government
                            remained entirely free from any commitments. The Ambassador appeared to
                            understand this, but I never know for certain how fully and accurately
                            we understand each other in given instances.</p>
                        <p>I concluded by saying that, if all of these basic principles mentioned
                            above were to be saved, it would require the prompt efforts of every
                            nation still disposed to support them in lieu of Hitler and the Hitler
                            methods of the most arbitrary domination of commercial and political
                            relations just as far across the earth as Hitler can possibly extend
                            domination, either military or economic, or other control by force or
                            threats of force; and that, therefore, it was high time that his
                            Government go forward, if it has such a purpose in mind, as I knew the
                            Ambassador himself has; that I must repeat that from this time forward I
                            do not know what steps of resistance may be taken in this country from
                            one day to another.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his full appreciation of the views and
                            observations I set forth and added that he would urge his country at
                            once to go forward with the proposals, as set forth in his document.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at my hotel apartment at his request. He
                            promptly proceeded to say that his Government had instructed him to hand
                            me certain documents, of which the attached are copies.<note n="18f"
                                xml:id="d246fn18f">These documents were returned upon request to the
                                Japanese Ambassador on May 12, before complete copies had been
                                made.</note> He had still another document, which he said was
                            prepared by his Government and which constituted a part of the written
                            material that he was instructed to deliver to me. The latter document,
                            he stated, was not correctly translated in certain respects, and he
                            added that he would withhold it until the translation was perfected
                            tomorrow, when it would be sent to me in proper form.</p>
                        <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0482"/>
                        <p>I thanked him for coming in and then very clearly and slowly said to him
                            in effect that, in accordance with our past conversations, I was
                            receiving these documents in a purely unofficial way with a view to
                            examining them and ascertaining whether they, accompanied by any
                            suggestions or proposals of our own made in the same unofficial and
                            informal manner, would or might afford a basis for a step in
                            negotiations. I added that, in these circumstances, either Government
                            could deal with any rumors or reports about negotiations by truthfully
                            saying that no negotiations have been instituted; that the rumors or
                            reports on this subject could at the most only relate to a casual
                            reference or remark made at some time by representatives of the United
                            States or Japan regarding some phase of the relations existing between
                            our two Governments, et cetera, et cetera. The Ambassador agreed
                            entirely to the foregoing.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired whether Matsuoka would conduct the negotiations at Tokyo.
                            The Ambassador replied that he would, but that the Army, the Navy and
                            Konoye would participate in the work of carrying on the negotiations,
                            although Konoye did not make it a habit of interfering materially in
                            such work of the Foreign Office. I said that Matsuoka was, of course, a
                            politician and that he had recently been quoted as making, in a purely
                            gratuitous way, numerous unfriendly remarks about the United States, as
                            well as announcing ideas and doctrines diametrically opposed to most of
                            the fundamental principles set out in the document which the Ambassador
                            prepared some weeks ago, and with the contents of which we were all
                            familiar. I added that, in these circumstances, there will be real
                            difficulty to persuade even my associates of the absolute dependability
                            of Matsuoka’s acts and utterances. I said that I mentioned this in order
                            that the Ambassador would fully understand my difficulties in more
                            respects than one. The Ambassador not only did not take issue with
                            anything I said, but I felt that he was really in harmony with the
                            statements I made about Matsuoka.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that Japan was very desirous of keeping war out
                            of the Pacific. I remarked very emphatically that many people in this
                            country strongly believe that Japan’s real purpose was to secure
                            cooperation to aid her in getting out of China and her disastrous
                            Chinese campaign and that this point would be uppermost in the minds of
                            many and it was one of the most important to be guarded against. The
                            Ambassador said he realized that that would be an exceedingly important
                            matter to be made clear. I emphasized this point a number of times in
                            the conversation.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired as to whether there were any definite plans in the mind
                            of his Government in regard to when the Japanese troops would come out
                            of China, and what assurances, if any, there were that they <pb n="417"
                                xml:id="pg_417" facs="0483"/>would actually come out under a
                            mutually satisfactory arrangement. The Ambassador did not know so much
                            about this, but felt it could and would be worked out to the
                            satisfaction of both sides. I said this would, of course, be a vitally
                            important point for determination.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador whether his Government had in mind any method of
                            giving absolute assurances that it would not use either force or threat
                            of force for purposes of conquest in the southwestern area of the
                            Pacific or other countries. The Ambassador had nothing special to offer
                            on this point except to say that his Government had no purpose to use
                            force or threat of force in this entire southwestern area.</p>
                        <p>I spoke generally then and said that, if his Government really desires a
                            settlement of the Pacific situation on a basis of peace and genuine
                            friendliness, there should be no serious difficulty about the matter;
                            that he and his Government know the relations existing between this
                            country and South America, which offer equal opportunity, politically,
                            economically and every other way, to all countries alike, including the
                            United States and Japan; that my Government treats the smallest
                            countries in this hemisphere, such as Haiti, on a basis of absolute
                            equality in every sense with the largest countries, such as Brazil and
                            the Argentine. I then inquired why it was that Japan, with ample
                            capacity and standing to command influence and recognition, both at home
                            and abroad, persists in an effort to use such high-sounding phrases as
                            the “new order in greater east Asia” and variations of this slogan. I
                            added that, unless Japan uses this slogan not as embodying the
                            principles of law, justice, equality and nonintervention, but as a cloak
                            under which Japan would continue her policy of conquest by force, there
                            was absolutely no reason why this trouble-making slogan should be
                            persistently flaunted before the peaceful and sovereign nations, and
                            that Japan could get all of the benefits from contacts with other
                            nations without this slogan that the United States gets from its
                            association with South American countries without such slogan, and,
                            therefore, I cannot understand why Japan persisted in using it. The
                            Ambassador had little comment to make, but did not take issue with what
                            I said. He emphasized from time to time that his country desired to keep
                            war out of the Pacific, and that it did not intend to use force in the
                            South Sea area.</p>
                        <p>I again repeated that we were profoundly convinced that Hitler and
                            Hitlerism will prove not only a scourge to other parts of the world, as
                            it has in Europe, but that it will be applied to Japan herself just as
                            quickly as it was applied to friendly countries in Europe who trusted
                            Hitler and his previous guarantees of friendship, safety and freedom
                            from attack and invasion.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>I took advantage of a remark of the Ambassador to the effect that it
                            would be an incalculable loss to both Japan and the United States, as
                            well as to civilization, if our two countries should become engaged in
                            war, by saying that unless the civilization of the world is to run the
                            great risk of being destroyed anyhow by the world movements of Hitler,
                            it will require all of the united efforts of civilized nations like
                            Japan, the United States and Great Britain to shape the course of the
                            world in a different direction, and that steps looking towards the
                            gradual development of basic programs both for the transition and the
                            post-war periods cannot be taken too soon. The Ambassador, of course,
                            agreed to this.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I reemphasized that this Government is determined that
                            Hitler shall not get control of the seas and that we would feel obliged
                            without the slightest hesitation to resist to a successful conclusion
                            such efforts on his part whether one year, five years or ten years
                            should be involved. The Ambassador again bowed and smiled approvingly
                            without saying anything. I said that, in these circumstances, with
                            things moving so rapidly, no one could tell, as I remarked to him in our
                            previous conversations, what any day might bring forth, I then repeated
                            my former statement to him that, since Hitler avows his movement to be
                            one of world control, and hence of conquest by force, this country does
                            not propose to commit suicide, as so many countries in continental
                            Europe did, by trusting Hitler and by waiting until it was too late to
                            resist; that we propose to resist, when and where such resistance would
                            be most effective, whether within our own boundaries or on the high seas
                            or in aid of such countries as Great Britain, and that such resistance
                            would be to the maximum extent within the minimum of time, and that this
                            in its very nature would constitute necessary self-defense against an
                            avowed world-wide aggressor, and in no sense could be construed as an
                            act of offense, much less aggression, in the light of the world nature
                            of the movement of aggression on Hitler’s part.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at my apartment at his request. He came in
                            apparently more or less concerned and said that he had made a mistake
                            when he handed me yesterday his document of instructions from Tokyo,
                            including one to follow entitled “explanations of the original
                            document.” He added that he should not have handed to me, along with
                            these official instructions, the copy of Premier <pb n="419"
                                xml:id="pg_419" facs="0485"/>Konoye’s statement of December 22,

                                    target="#pg_122">p. 122</ref></note> He then handed to me what
                            he said were the proper documents constituting his instructions, copies
                            of which are hereto attached.<note n="19c" xml:id="d247fn19c"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> At the same time he requested
                            me to return to him the entire set of documents handed to me on
                            yesterday, including that portion of his instructions to which reference
                            has already been made, and copies of which have been placed on file here
                            in the Department.</p>
                        <p>I thanked him and then proceeded to ask a few oral questions. One
                            question related to modification of the provision in his original
                            document about Japan’s keeping out of the South Sea area in a military
                            way. He said that the original language was such as to bind Japan alone,
                            leaving the United States and all other nations free to go in that area
                            if they should see fit, and that the only purpose was to place Japan on
                            a basis of equality with other countries.</p>
                        <p>I brought up the references to the three principles contained in the
                            statement made by Premier Konoye in December 1938, and inquired if they
                            might not constitute the so-called “new order in greater eastern Asia”
                            declaration, and the Ambassador said that the purpose was only to refer
                            to the three principles set out in the explanation which accompanies
                            this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was very earnest in his insistence that his Government had
                            no desire or purpose to go to the southern area with force, and he again
                            repeated that Japan desired to keep war out of the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>In answer to another question, he said that both documents were official,
                            as stated, and that the purpose in having them separated was to enable
                            his Government to give out to the press only the main document with the
                            other manuscript containing the explanations omitted for the purpose of
                            face-saving.</p>
                        <p>I again made it very clear that I would receive these papers entirely
                            unofficially and informally and would study them before passing on their
                            merits in any way even in an informal and unofficial way. The Ambassador
                            agreed to this.</p>

                                of the United States that he enter into negotiations for peace.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at my hotel apartment at his request. He
                            immediately handed me a proposed amendment, copy attached,<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d249fn23"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> to the
                            original draft which we have been discussing for some days.</p>
                        <p>I, of course, was expecting the Ambassador to have other and more
                            important things to talk about, but he disclosed nothing. We had some
                            general conversation, but there was no real reference to the questions
                            at issue except the question of whether this country would be in danger
                            from the war in Europe. Following this we had some discussion as to the
                            facts constituting self-defense on the part of the United States. The
                            Ambassador indicated his views and that of his country that we would not
                            be in danger. I thereupon repeated to him the facts and circumstances,
                            as set forth in my speech of three weeks ago,<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d249fn24">For extracts from address by the Secretary of

                            fact that this hemisphere <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0492"/>and
                            this country would be and are in serious and imminent danger; that the
                            attack would come on South America, and that the entire safety of this
                            hemisphere and this country from Hitler’s movement of unlimited military
                            conquest would depend on whether he conquers Great Britain with a real
                            probability or possibility that he would then come into control of the
                            high seas. The Ambassador appeared and talked as though he were
                            impressed with these facts and conclusions. He reiterated that nobody in
                            his country wanted war with this country except a few scattered
                            individuals and small groups; that his country did not desire or intend
                            to go south with military force.</p>
                        <p>He then made reference to what he considered the somewhat difficult
                            question of dealing with the attitude of this Government towards the
                            war, and that of Japan towards the war under the Tripartite
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that the Ambassador had undoubtedly observed in the press that
                            Ambassador Grew had called on Matsuoka, and I added that Ambassador Grew
                            had reported to me that Matsuoka was more or less offensive in his
                            references to this country.<note n="24a" xml:id="d249fn24a">See telegram

                                    target="#pg_145">p. 145</ref>.</note> I added that I, of course,
                            knew the type of politician Matsuoka is and the loose and often bluffing
                            language he uses, and, therefore, I did not know whether he would
                            undertake to hinder, or, if possible, defeat further conversations along
                            the lines that we have been conducting them. The Ambassador laughed at
                            the Matsuoka reference and made some remarks himself about Matsuoka
                            being out for his own interest politically, and laughed again at the
                            idea of Matsuoka controlling the situation so as to defeat any further
                            conversations looking towards the question of whether negotiations would
                            be permissible.</p>

                        <p>In reply to a question by the Ambassador as to whether the Secretary
                            wished to imply that under the American Government’s interpretation of
                            self-defense the United States might become involved in the European war
                            even if its territory was not attacked, the Secretary observed that if
                            and as an aggressor in the course of his aggression against other
                            countries makes manifest a purpose of unlimited conquest it is necessary
                            for other countries to take appropriate measures of self-protection and
                            self-defense. Our policy of assistance to Great Britain was an
                            illustration of the kind of measures which he meant. As to what other
                            action this Government might take, this would depend upon what the
                            military authorities of this Government would deem essential to our
                            protection and self-defense in any given circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it went without saying that Japan desired only
                            peaceful relations with the United States, but that at the same time
                            Japan might be faced with the question of carrying out in good faith any
                            obligations it might be called upon to perform under Article III of the
                            Axis Alliance. The Secretary said that in his opinion the explanatory
                            statement, consisting chiefly of excerpts from an address he had made
                            some three weeks ago, would make the attitude of this Government on the
                            matter of self-defense very clear. The Secretary said that he felt that
                            the Japanese would feel the same way as we do under similar
                            circumstances. He referred to the suggestions which we had offered for a
                            formula under Section II of the Japanese proposal in regard to relations
                            of the United States and Japan to the European war as defining our
                            respective relations clearly.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it was the earnest hope of Japan that <pb
                                n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0494"/>the Government of the United
                            States would find itself able at the earliest possible moment to request
                            the Chinese Government to enter into negotiations with Japan for a peace
                            settlement. He expressed the hope that there would be no dilatory
                            tactics on the part of the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that if we could dispose of these two points which
                            had been brought up in a preliminary way no reason was perceived why we
                            could not then proceed rapidly with consideration of the proposal as a
                            whole.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the questions of joint defense against
                            communism and the recognition of Manchuria. The Secretary indicated that
                            if China and Japan could agree on the other points listed in the
                            Japanese “Annex and Explanation” he did not believe that difficulties
                            which might arise over these two points would be such as to prevent an
                            agreement between China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred briefly to the reciprocal feature of our suggested
                            redraft of Section V of the Japanese proposal, which relates to the
                            economic activity of the Southwest Pacific area, and expressed the hope
                            that subsequently other countries could be brought in. He alluded in
                            this connection to the fact that the benefits of our trade program in
                            South America are enjoyed by all nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that before proceeding further with our
                            discussion the Ambassador might wish to study the document handed the
                            Ambassador, and he added that he would be ready to see the Ambassador at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and his associates did not offer any critical comment with
                            respect to the Secretary’s observations or give any express indication
                            of their attitude toward the Secretary’s “Oral Statement”. They did not,
                            of course, have an opportunity to examine the document during the
                            interview.</p>

                        <p>There has not yet been time to study carefully the proposal which the
                            Ambassador has presented under instructions from his Government. From
                            such examination as it has been possible to make, however, certain
                            preliminary comments suggest themselves.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the purpose of the present discussions and of the
                            proposal presented by the Japanese Ambassador is to work out a formula
                            whereunder Japan and the United States may make manifest their common
                            desire and definite purpose to refrain from any aggressive act by force
                            and to pledge themselves in honor and in act to maintain and preserve
                            peace in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>Keeping in mind this admirable objective, it would seem advisable to
                            dispose of certain fundamental points before attempting to consider the
                            Japanese proposal as a whole.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the proposed formula in Section II in regard to the
                            relations of Japan and of the United States toward the European war, the
                            United States is, as the Ambassador is aware, engaged in an extensive
                            program of strengthening its national defense, and it regards as an
                            essential part of its program of self-defense aid to Great Britain and
                            to other countries which are resisting the present world-wide movement
                            of conquest and aggression by force. There is annexed a statement<note
                                n="28" xml:id="d251fn28">See annex 1, <hi rend="italic"
                                >infra</hi>.</note> which defines clearly the position of the
                            Government of the United States on this subject. The Japanese Government
                            will naturally wish to give careful consideration to the position of the
                            Government of the United States as set forth in the statement.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that on the basis of the fundamental purpose of pledging
                            themselves in honor and in act to refrain from any aggressive act by
                            force and to maintain and preserve peace in the Pacific area a mutually
                            satisfactory formula defining the relations of the United States and of
                            Japan toward the European war can be arrived at.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, there are offered for the Ambassador’s
                            consideration certain suggestions for possible revision of Section II of
                            the proposal.<note n="29" xml:id="d251fn29">See annex 2, <ref
                                    target="#pg_432">p. 432</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>With reference to the proposed formula in Section III in regard to the
                            relations of the United States and of Japan toward the China Affair, it
                            is noted that in the “Annex and Explanation” it is stated that in
                            Section III of the proposal there are exemplified principles of
                            neighborly friendship; joint defense against communism; economic
                            cooperation free from economic monopoly or limitation of the interests
                            of other countries; mutual respect of sovereignty and territories;
                            mutual respect for the inherent characteristics of each nation
                            cooperating as good neighbors and forming a Far Eastern nucleus
                            contributing to world peace; withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese
                            territory in accordance with an agreement to be concluded between Japan
                            and China; no annexation and no indemnities; and the independence of
                            Manchuria. While one or two of the points might present difficulties, it
                            is believed that, if China and Japan could come to agreement on the
                            basis of the other points mentioned, the remaining points with some
                            modification need not present insuperable obstacles.</p>
                        <p>The principles embodied in the Konoe Statement, as defined in the “Annex
                            and Explanation” as relating to neighborly friendship, joint defense
                            against communism, and economic cooperation free from economic <pb
                                n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0496"/>monopoly or limitation of the
                            interests of other countries, could, with some modification, it is
                            believed, be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore suggested that the Japanese Ambassador might consider
                            substituting for the present draft of Section III of the Japanese
                            proposal a draft which would include a recital of the principles as set
                            forth in the “Annex and Explanation”. Would not such a formula be more
                            likely to influence the Chinese Government to agree to negotiate a peace
                            settlement with Japan? Such assent is obviously essential to the
                            conclusion of an agreement such as is proposed between the Governments
                            of the United States and of Japan.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances, would there not be more prospect of success in a
                            procedure whereby the President would in advance make known in
                            confidence to Chiang Kai-shek the fundamental terms (or the definitive
                            substance thereof) within the framework of which China and Japan might
                            agree to negotiate a peace settlement?</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, there are offered for the Ambassador’s
                            consideration certain suggestions, based upon the principles set forth
                            in the “Annex and Explanation”, for possible alteration of Section III
                            of the Japanese proposal.<note n="30" xml:id="d251fn30">See annex 3,

                        <p>With reference to the proposed formula in Section V in regard to the
                            economic activities of Japan and of the United States in the
                            Southwestern Pacific area, it is suggested that the language of the
                            proposal might advantageously be revised so as (<hi rend="italic"
                            >a</hi>) to make the provisions of this section applicable in common to

                            emphasize the pledge of both countries to maintain and preserve peace in

                            <p>The position of the Government of the United States toward the
                                military movement of conquest inaugurated by Mr. Hitler is set forth
                                in a public address made by the Secretary of State on April 24,
                                1941. Some extracts which are directly in point and which are basic
                                in relation to the entire situation are as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… As waged by them (the aggressor powers) this is not an
                                        ordinary war. It is a war of assault by these would-be
                                        conquerors, employing every method of barbarism, upon
                                        nations which cling to their right to live in freedom and
                                        which are resisting in self-defense. <pb n="431"
                                            xml:id="pg_431" facs="0497"/>… Such is the movement
                                        which is extending rapidly throughout the world.</p>
                                    <p>“If experience shows anything, it shows that no nation
                                        anywhere has the slightest reason to feel that it will be
                                        exempted from attack by the invader, any more than, in a
                                        town overrun by bandits, the wealthiest citizen might expect
                                        to be free from attack.</p>
                                    <p>“… Every thinking man can answer the question for himself by
                                        simply calling the roll of the wretched victims of world
                                        aggression who are now in a condition of semi-slavery, and
                                        whose every hope of again enjoying the blessings of
                                        civilization depends only on the defeat or failure of the
                                        movement of conquest. So it is in Austria, Czechoslovakia,
                                        Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Albania,
                                        Luxemburg, France, Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria,
                                        Yugoslavia.</p>
                                    <p>“… The conclusion is plain. Now, after some fifteen nations
                                        have lost everything that makes life worth living, it is
                                        high time that the remaining free countries should arm to
                                        the fullest extent and in the briefest time humanly possible
                                        and act for their self-preservation.</p>
                                    <p>“… Events have shown beyond possible question that the safety
                                        of this hemisphere and of this country calls for resistance
                                        wherever resistance will be most effective. In my judgment
                                        our safety and security require that, in accordance with the
                                        declared policy of the legislative and executive branches of
                                        the Government, aid must be supplied without hesitation to
                                        Great Britain and those other countries that are resisting
                                        the sweep of the general conflagration. This policy means,
                                        in practical application, that such aid must reach its
                                        destination in the shortest of time and in maximum quantity.
                                        So—ways must be found to do this.</p>
                                    <p>“… Those nations that are making resistance are primarily
                                        seeking to save themselves, their homes and their liberties.
                                        Great Britain for instance is acting primarily for her own
                                        safety. The United States both in its direct defense effort
                                        and in the aid which it extends to the resisting nations is
                                        likewise acting primarily for its own safety. As safety for
                                        the nations that are offering resistance means security for
                                        us, aid to them is an essential part of our own defense.
                                        Every new conquest makes available to the aggressor greater
                                        resources for use against the remaining free peoples. Our
                                        aid to the resisting nations is not the mere crusading of a
                                        world benefactor. It is based on the definite knowledge that
                                        every free nation anywhere is a bastion of strength to all
                                        the remaining free peoples everywhere.</p>
                                    <p>“… Those Americans who, in effect, are saying that a British
                                        defeat would not matter to us, signally overlook the fact
                                        that the resulting delivery of the high seas to the invader
                                        would create colossal danger to our own national defense and
                                        security. The breadth of the sea may give us a little time.
                                        It does not give us safety. Safety can only come from our
                                        ability, in conjunction with other peace-loving nations, to
                                        prevent any aggressor from attaining control of the high
                                        seas.</p>
                                    <p>“… Some among us, doubtless with the best of intentions,
                                        still contend that our country need not resist until armed
                                        forces of an invader shall have crossed the boundary line of
                                        this hemisphere. But this merely means that there would be
                                        no resistance by the hemisphere, including the United
                                        States, until the invading countries had acquired complete
                                        control of the other four continents and of the high seas,
                                            <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0498"/>and thus had
                                        obtained every possible strategic advantage, reducing us to
                                        the corresponding disadvantage of a severely handicapped
                                        defense. This is an utterly shortsighted and extremely
                                        dangerous view.”</p>

                            <p>The foregoing statements make it clear that the attitude of the
                                Government of the United States is one of resolve to take measures
                                of self-defense in resistance to a movement, which, as has been made
                                unequivocally clear by the acts and utterances of Hitler, is
                                directed to world conquest by force from which no country and no
                                area are excepted. This attitude is based upon a most fundamental
                                consideration—that of the inalienable right of self-defense. The
                                only other attitude this Government could assume would be the
                                suicidal attitude of some fifteen countries in Europe which also
                                were told, as our country is being told, that they would not be
                                molested but that if they should undertake to resist beyond their
                                own boundaries they would be charged with being aggressors and with
                                having assumed the offensive. A similar course by this nation from
                                the standpoint of effective defense against the Hitler movement of
                                world conquest would be absurd, futile and suicidal from the
                                standpoint of reasonable precautions for its safety.</p>
                            <p>In the light of the existing situation, Hitler is the one person who
                                can promptly remove the necessity for efforts at effective
                                self-defense by this country and other countries similarly situated,
                                whereas for any other nation to request that the United States
                                desist from any such resistance would in its actual effect range the
                                country making-such request on the side of Hitler and his movement
                                of aggression by force. Hitler is therefore the person who should be
                                addressed in support of peace, rather than those whom he is
                                attacking for the purpose of bringing about their complete
                                subjugation without color of law, or of right, or of humanity.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador, accompanied by Colonel Iwakuro and Mr.

                            at his apartment at 8:30 this evening by arrangement at the suggestion
                            of the Japanese Ambassador.<note n="33" xml:id="d252fn33">Maxwell M.
                                Hamilton, Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs, was also
                                present.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador how in the opinion of the Ambassador
                            the prospects now looked in regard to the proposal under consideration.
                            The Ambassador replied that the Japanese Army and Navy as well as the
                            Foreign Office had approved the matter; that the whole Cabinet had
                            approved it; that it had been referred to the Emperor—in fact the matter
                            was one which would have unanimous support in Japan. He went on to say
                            that if now we should fail to carry the proposal through, he would be in
                            a very embarrassing position vis-à-vis his Government. (The implication
                            of this statement was that he had indicated to his Government that
                            agreement of the American Government was assured.) The Ambassador hoped
                            that we would not be disposed to dwell upon technicalities but would
                            look at the proposal from the point of view of its broad spirit. He
                            observed that it would be a pity if we failed to reach an understanding
                            through disagreement on words. The Ambassador endeavored to emphasize
                            that there was no essential difference in substance between the draft
                            proposal which he had first submitted to his Government and the draft
                            which he had been instructed by his Government to present to us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then observed that there were two points in regard to the
                            section dealing with China which he would like to bring up. One was in
                            regard to the joint defense against communism and the other was in
                            regard to the stationing of Japanese troops in certain parts of Chinese
                            territory. He said that he was not discussing the merits of the two
                            points to which he referred but he felt that if and when this Government
                            should approach Chiang Kai-shek on the <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435"
                                facs="0501"/>matter of negotiating with Japan he would have to tell
                            Chiang the basis on which Japan would propose to negotiate; that this
                            basis should be one on which Chiang could carry his country with him;
                            and that if the Chinese Government should be unwilling to proceed with
                            negotiations on the basis proposed the Secretary would be in a very
                            embarrassing position. He therefore wished to ask whether it would not
                            be possible to cover these two points under some broader provision, such
                            as a provision which would call for special measures of protection for
                            Japanese nationals and property interests against lawlessness in areas
                            where special measures for safeguarding the rights and interests of
                            nationals of third powers were necessary.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that it was a matter of surprise to him that we had
                            brought up these points, as it was his conception that the central
                            objective of the proposal which we were discussing was the peace of the
                            Pacific between Japan and the United States and that the settlement of
                            the China affair was incidental and concerned China and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that the central objective was the peace of the
                            Pacific between Japan and the United States but that a peaceful
                            settlement between Japan and China was an essential element in the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton commented that in dealing with a proposal such as the one
                            before us it was necessary to consider the general effect upon the
                            public of any arrangement that might be entered into, as the success of
                            such an arrangement would depend upon the broad sweep of the support it
                            received from the public. If, for example, there was in one part of the
                            agreement a provision that Japanese troops would be withdrawn and
                            further down a provision for joint defense against communism, critics
                            might say “Ah—here is the joker; Japanese troops will be retained after
                            all under cloak of the provision ‘joint defense against communism’”.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro hastened to renounce any idea that Japanese troops would
                            be retained all over China for joint defense against communism but only
                            in north China along the northern border. He said that in his opinion as
                            between Japan and China the point under discussion would present no
                            difficulty, that Chiang Kai-shek himself was alive to the danger of
                            communism and that, while he could not speak of most recent developments
                            in Chinese governmental attitude toward the subject, his earlier
                            experience in China convinced him that China would be only too ready to
                            collaborate with Japan in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro then went on to say that the term “joint defense against
                            communism” had become a slogan which had been impressed upon the
                            Japanese public as an essential requisite for some years past, that it
                            had become a cardinal objective in Japan’s conflict with China, <pb
                                n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0502"/>and that it would be impossible
                            for the Japanese to abandon it. He suggested that it might be possible
                            to cover it under some broader language in an agreement as between Japan
                            and the United States, but he wished to make it clear that Japan would
                            have to retain the term in its negotiations with China.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion, the Japanese apparently came to see that
                            the problem presented a real difficulty and they agreed to give the
                            point further study.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that a problem was presented in drafting the
                            wording of Section III in regard to the China affair, for if we
                            enumerated the Konoe principles, as the Japanese desired, we were
                            confronted by the fact that “joint defense against communism” was the
                            second of the Konoe principles.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro pointed out that if we referred to the Konoe principles
                            without specifying which ones we had in mind we should be endorsing
                            Konoe’s exhortation for the destruction of Chiang Kai-shek and the “new
                            order in East Asia”.</p>
                        <p>There was then some discussion of whether the Japanese term which was
                            ordinarily translated “joint defense against communism” was not
                            susceptible of some other translation, and reference was made to the
                            term “inimical foreign ideologies” used in recent Pan-American
                            instruments as a possible suggestion. The Japanese agreed to study this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the Document which the Ambassador had
                            presented on May 12 marked “Oral Explanation for Proposed Amendments to
                            the Original Draft” be marked “Annex and Supplement”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary next took up a suggestion in reference to Section V
                            “activities of the two countries in the Southwestern Pacific area”. He
                            asked whether it would not be helpful from the Japanese point of view to
                            insert phraseology recognizing the right of a country to take action to
                            protect itself under international law but qualifying this right in such
                            a way that it would not be used as an occasion for acts of
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro expressed the opinion that to do this would be merely
                            confusing and suggested that it would be unwise to inject any new
                            principles into the proposed agreement. The Secretary then said that he
                            had made this suggestion with the sole idea of being helpful to the
                            Japanese. He then suggested that it would strengthen the proposed
                            agreement very much if language could be put in which would make clear
                            that the central purpose of this agreement was the peace of the Pacific.
                            The Japanese pointed out that this point had already been brought out in
                            the first section of the Japanese proposal “The Concepts of the United
                            States and of Japan Respecting International <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437"
                                facs="0503"/>Relations and the Character of Nations”. The Secretary
                            then suggested that references to the peace of the Pacific in the
                            proposal be assembled together in one place in the document where it
                            would be given special emphasis. He pointed out that in this way the
                            public would become impressed with the fact that it was the purpose of
                            Japan and the United States to bring about an era of peace in the
                            Pacific. This would bring about fresh hope in the world and vitalize the
                            proposed agreement itself. He pointed out also as an illustration of how
                            such emphasis would operate that the proposed agreement would appeal to
                            businessmen and develop their confidence and interest in financial and
                            commercial cooperation in the Far East. The suggestion was well taken by
                            the Japanese who said that they would give the matter study. It was
                            agreed to meet again the following evening.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador, accompanied by Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa,
                            called at 8:30 p.m. at the Secretary’s apartment in accordance with an
                            arrangement made at the meeting of the previous evening.<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d253fn34">Mr. Hamilton was also present.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in approaching the question of dealing with China
                            in regard to the matters which we had been discussing he desired to
                            refer briefly to his experience of the last eight years in relations
                            with the American Republics. He then alluded to the distrust which had
                            been built up in the Latin American countries toward the United States
                            as a result of our previous policies calling for the use of our armed
                            forces to support our interests there. He compared the situation which
                            existed up to the time of the Montevideo conference in 1933 with the
                            situation today, and he spoke of the good will toward and confidence in
                            the United States throughout Latin America which has resulted from our
                            policy of putting the Latin American countries on their honor to treat
                            our interests fairly. The Secretary said that it had occurred to him
                            that Chiang Kai-shek would probably have at his disposal numbers of
                            seasoned and trusted troops which could be utilized to protect areas
                            where special arrangements might be needed during a transitional period
                            on account of prevailing lawlessness and of the extent of the interests
                            of third power nationals to safeguard those interests. The Secretary
                            suggested further that <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0504"
                            />consideration might be given to the possibility, in arranging the
                            schedule for the proposed withdrawal of Japanese troops from China,
                            which would presumably involve a period of perhaps twelve months, to
                            plan on having the troops occupying the areas in question come out last;
                            a further idea would be to have a commission to deal with the problem
                            presented by the need for maintaining order in these areas. He said he
                            did not wish to pass upon the merits of these suggestions but was merely
                            raising them for consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then went on to the question which he had raised during the
                            previous evening of strengthening the emphasis in the document that
                            peace in the Pacific was the central purpose of the instrument. He said
                            that the instrument should, in his opinion, be so worded that it would
                            speak for itself and make its nature clear and unequivocal to the public
                            without the necessity of having its purposes explained by those who were
                            its sponsors. He felt that this was especially important in view of the
                            present situation of the world.</p>
                        <p>At this point a draft which we had prepared of a section numbered VI in
                            regard to peace in the Pacific area was taken up and from this draft
                            there emerged a mutually acceptable tentative formula, after the
                            Japanese had registered their objection to the inclusion of the last
                            sentence of our formula containing provision to the effect that action
                            taken to protect national interests under international law was not to
                            be made the occasion for aggression. The Japanese objection was stated
                            to be on the ground that it might appear that the insertion of such a
                            provision would indicate American suspicion of Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question of whether the Japanese would have
                            objection to describing their oral statement of May 12 as an “Annex and
                            Supplement”. The Ambassador said he believed there would be none.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether objection was perceived to inserting in the
                            “Annex and Supplement” the statement containing excerpts from his speech
                            of April 24 which had been attached to our oral statement of May 16 for
                            the purpose of clarifying our interpretation of what constituted
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wikawa said that he understood that our oral statement had been
                            withdrawn. Mr. Hamilton replied that Mr. Wikawa must have misunderstood.
                            Colonel Iwakuro said he wondered what was the need of supplementing a
                            simple understanding such as was contemplated with an elaborate
                            documentation.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Colonel Iwakuro’s question as to what purpose the Secretary’s
                            proposal would serve, the Secretary replied that he thought it would be
                            helpful both to the Japanese and to us as clarifying our attitude on the
                            subject. The Secretary added that Ambassador Grew had read the
                            Secretary’s speech in question to Mr. Matsuoka <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0505"/>and that Mr. Matsuoka had commented
                            favorably upon it. No indication was given by the Japanese of their
                            attitude on the Secretary’s proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton asked what was the necessity of a reference in Section III
                            to the Wang Ching-wei treaties, and he pointed out that this would be a
                            source of embarrassment to us as we had not recognized the Wang
                            Ching-wei régime and as they contained features which did not seem to us
                            consistent with the principles under which we now proposed to act. He
                            said that we had appreciated the force of the argument that the Japanese
                            people had come to set store by the Konoe principles, but surely the
                            treaty with the Wang Ching-wei régime was too recent to have a similar
                            place in the minds of the Japanese public.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro argued that the Wang Ching-wei treaty gave practical
                            application to the Konoe principles and he considered reference to them
                            necessary to clarify the position of the Japanese Government and the
                            Japanese public. He said he did not see the relevancy of our
                            non-recognition of the Wang régime to the question of making reference
                            to them in the way proposed. He added that in any case the understanding
                            was a confidential document and therefore he did not see how we would be
                            embarrassed as we need not refer to that treaty in taking up the matter
                            with the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton endeavored to make it clear to the Japanese that we could
                            not enter with [<hi rend="italic">into</hi>] any secret arrangement, as
                            such matters would be bound to be known in the course of a few weeks. No

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s apartment at 8:30 by
                            appointment made at the Ambassador’s request.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had gathered … that the Japanese Ambassador
                            was under an impression that the Secretary had said something to someone
                            of a nature indicative that in the Secretary’s opinion Mr. Matsuoka did
                            not carry much weight in the Japanese Government. The Secretary stated
                            that he had not said anything of this kind to anyone.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that under the Japanese constitutional system
                            other ministers in addition to the Foreign Minister are consulted in
                            matters relating to foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in his consideration of the matters we have been
                            exploring a difficulty has been presented by questions involving the
                            relations of our respective countries toward the European war. Mr.
                            Matsuoka since his return from Europe, according to reports widely
                            published in the press, has been making declarations on every occasion
                            in regard to Japan’s obligations under the Tripartite Alliance in the
                            matter of supporting Germany in the event of American entry into the
                            war. He said that, if we went into an agreement with Japan, critics
                            would assert, unless the Japanese Government could clarify its attitude
                            toward its obligations under the Tripartite Alliance in the event that
                            the United States should be drawn into the European war through action
                            in the line of self-defense, that there was no assurance as to Japan’s
                            position. The Secretary referred to the President’s speech of the
                            previous evening<note n="35" xml:id="d255fn35">Radio address of
                                President Roosevelt on May 27, 1941, printed in Department of State,

                                    rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, No. 101), p. 647.</note> and reviewed
                            what the Secretary had previously said publicly and also to the
                            Ambassador in regard to the attitude of this country toward maintaining
                            the freedom of the seas against Hitler as an essential measure of
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he had known Mr. Matsuoka for many years,
                            that Matsuoka was given to talking a great deal for domestic consumption
                            in Japan, but that the Ambassador was convinced that Matsuoka desired
                            only friendly relations with the United <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441"
                                facs="0507"/>States. The Ambassador said that in his personal
                            opinion there would be no war between Japan and the United States, as he
                            felt that once the proposed agreement was concluded it would have a
                            profound effect upon Japanese psychology which would cause a weakening
                            in the influence of the jingoes. He added that the Japanese people were
                            heartily sick of the idea of an economic bloc and desired to return to
                            the spirit of the Meiji restoration in which their horizon had been
                            broadened to intercourse and trade with the whole world. He said that
                            the American embargoes had made the Japanese feel that there was no
                            alternative at present to seeking an economic bloc, but they were
                            feeling the pinch of a restricted economy and would welcome a resumption
                            of normal trade.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he felt sure that the Ambassador and many of his
                            associates were sincere in their desire to have friendly relations, but
                            he suggested that it would be helpful if the Japanese Government could
                            offer something by way of clarification on the points which the
                            Secretary had raised.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he doubted very much whether the Japanese
                            Government would be willing to add anything to what it already proposed
                            saying, as the Japanese Government would be placed in a very difficult
                            position vis-à-vis Germany and Italy and there would also be domestic
                            difficulties from the pro-Axis group in Japan. The Ambassador added,
                            however, that the Japanese Government would make its own independent
                            decision and would not be dictated to by Germany and Italy in the matter
                            of interpreting Japan’s obligations under the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then brought up the question of the withdrawal of Japanese
                            troops from China and asked the Ambassador to indicate what the Japanese
                            Government had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that this was a matter concerning which he could not
                            say precisely what the Japanese army had in mind but would be dealt with
                            in direct negotiations between the Japanese and the Chinese Governments.
                            The Ambassador said he was of the personal opinion that negotiations
                            over this matter might be protracted—say, over a period of six
                            months—and that after that a period of two years would be required
                            before complete evacuation would be effected.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated, in reply to specific questions, that such
                            evacuation would not include troops retained in China under the
                            provision of cooperative defense against communistic activities. He
                            contemplated an arrangement being negotiated with China similar to the
                            Boxer Protocol<note n="36" xml:id="d255fn36"><ref
                                    target="frus1901China#pg_312"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    312</ref>.</note> under which Japanese troops would be stationed
                            for an indefinite period in north China and Inner Mongolia. The
                            Ambassador said he could not indicate approximately how many <pb n="442"
                                xml:id="pg_442" facs="0508"/>troops it was proposed to station in
                            China under such an arrangement or define precisely the areas in which
                            the arrangement would be operative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that it seemed to him important that relations
                            between China and Japan should be adjusted on a basis which would offer
                            permanent promise of friendship between the two countries; that the
                            continued presence of Japanese troops in China would be a factor
                            operating against such friendship, as the presence of these troops
                            tended to produce incidents and friction; and that we had found from our
                            experience in our relations with Latin American countries that a policy
                            of sending troops to settle claims did not pay. The Secretary then
                            outlined briefly the arrangements which have been set up for the
                            adjustment through peaceful means of claims and disputes among the
                            American countries to replace former practices. He said he thought that
                            Japan would find that similar arrangements as between Japan and China
                            would be a progressive step, as the sending to and stationing in China
                            of Japanese troops would not be profitable in the long run to Japan or
                            China. He asked whether the Japanese Government would not consider some
                            other means of dealing with the problems under reference than by
                            arrangements such as seemed to be under contemplation for the stationing
                            of troops.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he personally agreed with the Secretary’s view
                            that the stationing of troops was productive of incidents and
                            difficulties, but that he did not think that the Far East had progressed
                            to a point where it would be feasible at present to carry out a program
                            such as the Secretary suggested. He said that when Prince Konoe came out
                            with his statement of principles two years ago he was bitterly
                            criticized in Japan for such moderation in the face of the sacrifices
                            that Japan had made. Now, however, the Japanese public after four years
                            of fighting had come to accept Prince Konoe’s plan, and a suggestion of
                            further modification in the direction of moderation would present
                            difficulties to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in connection with the question of a possible
                            approach by this Government to the Chinese Government he had it in mind,
                            before entering into any negotiations, talking over in strict confidence
                            with the Chinese Government the general subject matter involved in the
                            proposals under discussion. In the meantime, our conversations would
                            continue, as they had so far on a purely unofficial and informal basis.
                            He explained that he was raising this question in regard to the question
                            of Japanese troops only because our conversations were in this
                            unofficial and informal exploratory stage and that he would not have
                            otherwise brought the question up.</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he did not expect that the American Government
                            would negotiate this question with the Chinese Government but would
                            merely serve as a bridge to bring the Chinese and Japanese together into
                            direct negotiations. He cited as examples of such action American good
                            offices in connection with the Sino-Japanese peace negotiations of 1895
                            and the Russo-Japanese peace negotiations of 1905.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Secretary’s question as to how the Chinese Government
                            would be likely to react to such a proposal as the one in regard to
                            stationing of troops for cooperative defense against communistic
                            activities, the Ambassador said that in his opinion the Chinese
                            Government had become very much weakened as a result of the continued
                            hostilities, that they had lost so much equipment that a Japanese force
                            was a match for a Chinese force twenty times as numerous. He thought
                            that Russian aid was now practically limited to that accorded the
                            Chinese Communists; that British aid was negligible; that the only thing
                            that was now sustaining Chiang Kai-shek was reliance upon American aid;
                            and that, if the United States should discontinue its aid, China would
                            be forced to come to terms with Japan on this matter. The Ambassador
                            added further that Chiang Kai-shek was riding on two horses—the Chinese
                            Communists and the Kuomintang; that the only factor which kept the two
                            horses together was Japanese pressure; and that in this situation Chiang
                            Kai-shek would find it very difficult to continue the conflict.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that these two points which he had brought out
                            presented difficulties to us and he asked whether the Japanese
                            Government could not give them further consideration. The Ambassador
                            replied that, if he should ask his Government for further instructions
                            in regard to the point about relations of Japan and the United States to
                            the European war, the Japanese Government would probably be unwilling to
                            give any further clarification. He made no definite statement as to
                            further consideration by the Japanese Government of the other point in
                            regard to the question of Japanese troops in China, but said that he
                            would consult further with Colonel Iwakuro. The Secretary said that he
                            also would give further thought to these matters.</p>
                        <p>As the Japanese Ambassador was leaving the Secretary reiterated the
                            points mentioned by him above that before entering into any negotiations
                            he had in mind to talk over the China matter with the Chinese Government
                            and that in the meantime our conversations would continue on ah entirely
                            informal and unofficial basis. He repeated also that it was only because
                            these conversations were of an informal and unofficial character that he
                            had discussed in this way the question of Japanese troops in China.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton<note n="36a" xml:id="d256fn36a">Mr. Hamilton was meeting
                                with Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa.</note> referred to the previous
                            conversations which the Secretary had had with the Japanese Ambassador
                            in which the Secretary had made mention of two points in the Japanese
                            proposal which presented specially important difficulties to us, and
                            expressed the view that with regard to one of them, the proposed
                            cooperative defense against communistic activities, it might be helpful
                            if Colonel Iwakuro could outline to us what the Japanese Government had
                            in mind as to what was involved in this point.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro reviewed briefly the historical background relating to
                            Japan’s efforts to prevent the spread of communism into Manchuria and
                            Japanese territory and discussed the need from the point of view of
                            Japan’s security of including in Japan’s terms for a peaceful settlement
                            with China provision for cooperative resistance against communistic
                            activities. He drew a rough sketch map of the general region of North
                            China, Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia to indicate the strategic
                            problem involved in protecting Manchuria from infiltration across Inner
                            Mongolia and North China of communistic elements. He drew a line along a
                            distance east and west showing the general region in Inner Mongolia
                            where it was proposed to station Japanese troops for protection against
                            the entry of communistic elements from Outer Mongolia. He also drew
                            lines of communication leading southward from this line to the
                            Peiping-Tientsin area with one extension leading southward along what
                            appeared to be the railway to Tsinan and thence through Shantung to
                            Tsingtao. He said it was proposed to station some troops to maintain
                            these lines of communication.</p>
                        <p>Asked how many Japanese troops it was contemplated stationing under such
                            an arrangement, the Colonel said that he had in mind a number between
                            one tenth and one fifth of the present force garrisoned in North China.
                            He said that the present number of the latter force was a military
                            secret. The Colonel wished to assure us positively that the troops which
                            would be maintained for resistance against communistic activities would
                            not under any circumstances interfere in Chinese internal affairs and
                            that in no circumstances would the provision, if adopted, for
                            cooperation for resistance against communistic activities be made the
                            occasion for the stationing of Japanese troops in areas in China other
                            than specified areas in Inner Mongolia or North China. The Colonel said
                            that there was envisaged, as the Ambassador had previously indicated, an
                            arrangement along <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0511"/>lines of the
                            Boxer Protocol to take care of this matter. Asked for how long a period
                            it was envisaged stationing Japanese troops in China for the purpose
                            under reference, Colonel Iwakuro replied that Japan did not intend to
                            make such stationing permanent but only so long as necessary for
                            protection against communistic activities from external sources. He
                            suggested that there was a possibility before many years of a war
                            between Japan and the Soviet Union, the outcome of which might alter the
                            situation with reference to the threat of communistic activities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said he wished to make it clear that we did not wish to
                            enter into the merits of the question presented, but that, in as much as
                            the Japanese proposal called for presentation by this Government to the
                            Chinese Government of Japan’s terms for a peaceful settlement, we could
                            not divest ourselves of a certain degree of responsibility in the
                            matter, and that the American people being a people devoted to
                            principles as well as a practical people, would expect this Government
                            to adhere to its declared principles. He raised for consideration the
                            question whether it might be possible to work out a formula whereby
                            under the point in regard to defense against communistic activities
                            there would be no reference to stationing of Japanese troops in Chinese
                            territory and under the point in regard to withdrawal of Japanese troops
                            a statement might be made somewhat to the effect that under a schedule
                            to be arranged with the Chinese Government for the withdrawal of
                            Japanese troops from China evacuation of forces in North China and Inner
                            Mongolia would be left to the last, and that shortly before the due date
                            of completion of evacuation the Japanese Government might propose to the
                            Chinese Government consultation in regard to measures called for by any
                            situation that might exist, including any situation with reference to
                            communistic activities.</p>
                        <p>Various suggestions were then offered in regard to a possible draft, and
                            the Japanese endeavored to get Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine to
                            collaborate in drafting something on this point, but Mr. Hamilton said
                            that it was already late and that it might be more helpful if each side
                            should give further consideration to this point independently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton also paid a tribute to the frankness which Colonel Iwakuro
                            had manifested in all his talks and said that we had all been much
                            impressed by his broad grasp of the problems involved in our
                            discussions.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Japan accept joint
                            responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general agreement
                            of understanding as expressed in a joint declaration.</p>
                        <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is the
                            sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led to the
                            deterioration of amicable sentiment between their countries should be
                            prevented from recurrence and corrected in their unforeseen and
                            unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is our present hope that, by a cooperative effort, the United States
                            and Japan may contribute effectively toward establishment and
                            preservation of peace in the Pacific area; and, by the rapid
                            consummation of an amicable understanding, arrest, if not dispel, the
                            tragic confusion that now threatens to engulf civilization.</p>
                        <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem ill-suited
                            and weakening. Both Governments, therefore, desire that adequate
                            instrumentalities should be developed for the realization of a general
                            understanding which would bind, meanwhile, both Governments in honor and
                            in act.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the two Governments that such an understanding should
                            comprise only the pivotal issues of urgency and not the accessory
                            concerns which could be deliberated at a conference.</p>
                        <p>Both Governments presume to anticipate that they could achieve harmonious
                            relations if certain situations and attitudes were clarified or
                            improved; to wit: <list>

                                1941. Some extracts which are directly in point and which are basic
                                in relation to the entire situation are as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… As waged by them (the aggressor powers) this is not an
                                        ordinary war. It is a war of assault by these would-be
                                        conquerors, employing every method of barbarism, upon
                                        nations which cling to their right to live in freedom and
                                        which are resisting in self-defense.… Such is the movement
                                        which is extending rapidly throughout the world.</p>
                                    <p>“If experience shows anything, it shows that no nation
                                        anywhere has the slightest reason to feel that it will be
                                        exempted from attack by the invader, any more than, in a
                                        town overrun by bandits, the wealthiest citizen might expect
                                        to be free from attack.</p>
                                    <p>“… Every thinking man can answer the question for himself by
                                        simply calling the roll of the wretched victims of world
                                        aggression who are now in a condition of semi-slavery, and
                                        whose every hope of again enjoying the blessings of
                                        civilization depends only on the defeat or failure of the
                                        movement of conquest. So it is in Austria, Czechoslovakia,
                                        Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Albania,
                                        Luxemburg, France, Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria,
                                        Yugoslavia.</p>
                                    <p>“… The conclusion is plain. Now, after some fifteen nations
                                        have lost everything that makes life worth living, it is
                                        high time that the remaining free countries should arm to
                                        the fullest extent and in the briefest time humanly possible
                                        and act for their self-preservation.</p>
                                    <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0516"/>
                                    <p>“… Events have shown beyond possible question that the safety
                                        of this hemisphere and of this country calls for resistance
                                        wherever resistance will be most effective.… This policy
                                        means, in practical application, that … aid must reach its
                                        destination in the shortest or time and in maximum quantity.
                                        So—ways must be found to do this.</p>
                                    <p>“… Those nations that are making resistance are primarily
                                        seeking to save themselves, their homes and their liberties.
                                        Great Britain for instance is acting primarily for her own
                                        safety. The United States both in its direct defense effort
                                        and in the aid which it extends to the resisting nations is
                                        likewise acting primarily for its own safety. As safety for
                                        the nations that are offering resistance means security for
                                        us, aid to them is an essential part of our own defense.
                                        Every new conquest makes available to the aggressor greater
                                        resources for use against the remaining free peoples. Our
                                        aid to the resisting nations is not the mere crusading of a
                                        world benefactor. It is based on the definite knowledge that
                                        every free nation anywhere is a bastion of strength to all
                                        the remaining free peoples everywhere.</p>
                                    <p>“… Those Americans who, in effect, are saying that a British
                                        defeat would not matter to us, signally overlook the fact
                                        that the resulting delivery of the high seas to the invader
                                        would create colossal danger to our own national defense and
                                        security. The breadth of the sea may give us a little time.
                                        It does not give us safety. Safety can only come from our
                                        ability, in conjunction with other peace-loving nations, to
                                        prevent any aggressor from attaining control of the high
                                        seas.</p>
                                    <p>“… Some among us, doubtless with the best of intentions,
                                        still contend that our country need not resist until armed
                                        forces of an invader shall have crossed the boundary line of
                                        this hemisphere. But this merely means that there would be
                                        no resistance by the hemisphere, including the United
                                        States, until the invading countries had acquired complete
                                        control of the other four continents and of the high seas,
                                        and thus had obtained every possible strategic advantage,
                                        reducing us to the corresponding disadvantage of a severely
                                        handicapped defense. This is an utterly shortsighted and
                                        extremely dangerous view.”</p>

                            <p>The foregoing statements make it clear that the attitude of the
                                Government of the United States is one of resolve to take measures
                                of self-defense in resistance to a movement, which, as has been made
                                unequivocally clear by the acts and utterances of Hitler, is
                                directed to world conquest by force from which no country and no
                                area are excepted. This attitude is based upon a most fundamental
                                consideration—that of the inalienable right of self-defense. The
                                only other attitude this Government could assume would be the
                                suicidal attitude of some fifteen countries in Europe which also
                                were told, as our country is being told, that they would not be
                                molested but that if they should undertake to resist beyond their
                                own boundaries they would be charged with being aggressors and with
                                having assumed the offensive. A similar course by this nation from
                                the standpoint of effective defense against the Hitler movement of
                                world conquest would be absurd, futile and suicidal from the
                                standpoint of reasonable precautions for its safety.</p>

                            <p>In the light of the existing situation, Hitler is the one person who
                                can promptly remove the necessity for efforts at effective
                                self-defense by this country and other countries similarly situated,
                                whereas for any other nation to request that the United States
                                desist from any such resistance would in its actual effect range the
                                country making such request on the side of Hitler and his movement
                                of aggression by force. Hitler is therefore the person who should be
                                addressed in support of peace, rather than those whom he is
                                attacking for the purpose of bringing about their complete
                                subjugation without color of law, or of right, or of humanity.</p>

                            clarifying the meaning.</p>
                        <p>In the list of points enumerated on page two of the Japanese draft, the

                            subject matter, the word “Southwestern” has been omitted from point
                            numbered five and, in view of the new subject matter under point six

                            of which is therefore listed, and part of the subject matter in Section
                            VI of the Japanese draft has been omitted (for explanation see <hi
                                rend="italic">infra</hi>).</p>

                        <p>The first paragraph has been omitted in as much as the statement of fact

                        <p>In the third paragraph of the Japanese draft there has been substituted
                            for the word “backward” the word “other” in order to maintain
                            consistency with principles relating to equality of races and

                        <p>The first paragraph of the Japanese draft has been omitted in order to
                            avoid any implication of inconsistency with statements made by the
                            President to the effect that the present is not an opportune time for
                            the American Government to endeavor to bring about peace in Europe.</p>
                        <p>To the second paragraph of the Japanese draft a new sentence has been

                        <p>The third paragraph has been omitted in as much as the text of the

                        <p>The fourth paragraph of the Japanese draft has been revised to emphasize

                            States toward the European hostilities.</p>

                            the contents.</p>
                        <p>The statement in the Japanese draft has been rewritten to keep the
                            underlying purport and at the same time to avert raising questions which
                            do not seem fundamental to the basic subject and which are controversial
                            in character and might present serious difficulties from the point of
                            view of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The statement in the Japanese Annex and Supplement in regard to this
                            section has also been revised in a few particulars in conformity with
                            the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. In addition,
                            point numbered three in regard to economic cooperation has been
                            rephrased so as to make it clear that China and Japan intend to follow
                            in their economic relations the principle of nondiscrimination <pb

                            and the Chinese Government have long subscribed and which principle
                            forms the foundation of the commercial policy of the United States. As
                            it is assumed that the term “troops” in point numbered six is meant to
                            include all armed forces, the language of this point has been slightly
                            rephrased to avoid possible ambiguity.</p>
                        <p>As already stated, the question relating to communistic activities,
                            including the stationing of Japanese troops in Chinese territory, is
                            subject to further discussion.</p>

                            United States clarifying the point that as a temporary measure during
                            the present international emergency it is understood that each country
                            may restrict export of commodities which it needs for its own purposes

                            of the fundamental purpose of the understanding. The thought in mind is
                            to give emphasis to this purpose so that the document may speak for
                            itself on this all-important subject.</p>
                        <p>The statement of fundamental purpose has been assigned a section by
                            itself in order that it may gain added emphasis.</p>

                        <p>The statement in regard to Japanese immigration has been omitted in view
                            of the established position of the United States that the question of
                            immigration is a domestic matter. For that reason, to attempt to include
                            a statement on this subject would stand in the way of the underlying
                            purposes of the agreement.</p>

                            could probably arrange to keep the understanding secret for a period of
                            a few weeks, during which time it believes that the two Governments

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan came to my hotel apartment at his request. He
                            said he merely desired to call for a few minutes to say he thought that
                            he and his associates were in agreement with the document which Mr.
                            Ballantine had handed to him entitled “Unofficial, Exploratory and
                            without Commitment”, dated May 31, 1941, with the exception of some of
                            the phraseology. He then said that he would like to have his
                            subordinates and my associates talk over this phase while he was absent
                            in New York during the next few days. I replied that his statement was
                            interesting and that I would be pleased to notify my two associates,
                            Messrs. Hamilton and Ballantine, to the end that the desired
                            conversation might be had.</p>
                        <p>I then very slowly and deliberately asked the Ambassador whether it was
                            his considered judgment that his Government seriously and earnestly
                            desired to enter into a settlement for peace and non-discriminatory
                            commercial relations and friendship generally in the Pacific area. He
                            promptly replied that that was his judgment. I remarked that, in the
                            light of the loud statements which Matsuoka and others were daily
                            making, the question which I propounded was sharply raised, and that one
                            was forced back to the inquiry of whether Japan really is seeking this
                            sort of settlement, or whether she is only seeking a way to get out of
                            China, and otherwise to go forward with methods and practices entirely
                            contrary to the principles which would have <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455"
                                facs="0521"/>to underlie a settlement establishing peace,
                            non-discriminatory commerce and fair friendly relations in the Pacific
                            area. The Ambassador reiterated his view that an earnest and fair
                            settlement was desired.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired about the policy of keeping Japanese troops stationed in
                            China indefinitely, and added that this was an extremely important point
                            in the situation and expressed the hope that the Government of Japan was
                            considering the viewpoint we had expressed. The Ambassador did not offer
                            anything encouraging in his comment. I again emphasized the great
                            importance of Japan’s giving this matter most serious study before
                            taking the opposite course which is so completely discredited everywhere
                            in the world. The Ambassador added nothing appreciably in his further
                            comment.</p>

                        <p>In pursuance of an arrangement made by the Japanese Ambassador with the
                            Secretary on June 3, Mr. Wakasugi,<note n="37a" xml:id="d261fn37a"

                                >Koto Matsudaira, Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy.</note>
                            met with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine at the Wardman Park Hotel at
                            three o’clock. Mr. Wakasugi said that it was their desire that we should
                            discuss unofficially and tentatively various points arising in
                            connection with the Japanese proposal and the revision of that proposal
                            which was handed to the Japanese Ambassador on May 31.</p>
                        <p>Our discussion was made on the basis of the draft of May 31.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Preamble, Mr. Wakasugi raised the question whether
                            by the reference to “a joint declaration” in the first paragraph it was
                            intended that there was to be another instrument in addition to the
                            draft now before us. Mr. Hamilton said that it was our understanding
                            that this draft itself constituted the joint declaration. No objection
                            was raised to this explanation. Mr. Wakasugi then asked whether the
                            principle of the <hi rend="italic">alternat</hi> (rotation in precedence
                            in naming the two countries in the document) would be observed in
                            drawing up the Japanese and the American texts of the understanding. Mr.
                            Hamilton said that he perceived no difficulty in this but that it was
                            his thought that there would be but one document. He added that we would
                            take note of that point which they had raised for further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi indicated that the Japanese desired to substitute in the
                            fifth line of the second paragraph the word “arrest” for “corrected”, as
                            there was an implication in the word “corrected” of censure of the
                            conduct of one or both of the two countries. In the first line of the
                            third paragraph they desired to alter the word “present” to “earnest” or
                            to omit the word “present” altogether, as the implications of the word
                            “present” were not clear. In the fifth paragraph of the Preamble they
                            desired to delete the words appearing in the last line “at a conference”
                            and to substitute the word “later”, as they felt that reference to a
                            conference might be interpreted as committing them to a conference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton observed that all of these words which they desired to
                            change were taken over from the Japanese draft, but that we would note
                            their desire to have these changes made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that with reference to the wording of caption five they
                            would like to have a change made which they would take up when we came
                            to a discussion of Section V.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Section I, relating to the general concepts of Japan
                            and of the United States, Mr. Wakasugi said that they would like to
                            insert after “one household” in line three of paragraph two the phrase
                            “under the ideal of universal concord, justice and equity”. Mr. Hamilton
                            raised question whether the Japanese were thinking of some vague
                            idealistic concept or of something which had present-day, practical
                            application. Mr. Wakasugi explained that the purpose of the Japanese
                            suggested addition was to define Japan’s ethical concept of a household
                            in the sense used in this document. In the last line of the same
                            paragraph they desired to substitute “peoples” for “nations”, as you
                            could, for example, speak of a Malayan people but not of a Malayan
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>In Section II, relating to the European war, Mr. Wakasugi asked that
                            there be deleted the second sentence of the first paragraph, reading as
                            follows: “Obviously, the provisions of the Pact do not apply to
                            involvement through acts of self-defense.” Mr. Wakasugi said that Japan
                            does not want to be bound by our interpretation of self-defense and that
                            Japan cannot commit itself in advance to what action it might take in
                            respect to the acts of some other countries. Mr. Hamilton commented that
                            it might be helpful to us toward gaining an understanding of what the
                            Japanese had in mind in reference to this whole section if they would
                            disregard the text of the proposed section and explain to us in their
                            own words their underlying thought. After some inconclusive statements
                            by Mr. Wakasugi, Mr. Hamilton commented that we had been given to
                            understand by certain persons that the Japanese Government desired
                            gradually to move away from its affiliations with the Axis powers and
                            that one purpose of the proposed understanding between the Japanese and
                            the American <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0523"/>Governments was to
                            create an atmosphere which would facilitate such action on the part of
                            Japan. Mr. Hamilton asked Mr. Wakasugi to comment on this and, if Mr.
                            Wakasugi confirmed the impressions conveyed to us by some other people,
                            to explain how the proposed understanding would accomplish such purpose.
                            Mr. Wakasugi stated categorically that if we had received any such
                            impressions they were not in accord with fact. He said that Japan had no
                            intention of not discharging its obligations under the Tripartite
                            Alliance and that Japan must be left free to make its own decision
                            whether any action by the United States in reference to the European
                            situation would cause Japan to fulfill her obligations under the Pact.
                            Mr. Hamilton then said that he would be interested in hearing Colonel
                            Iwakuro’s comment. Colonel Iwakuro explained that it was entirely
                            incorrect to assume that the purpose of the understanding was to enable
                            Japan to drift away from the Tripartite Pact and that, if the United
                            States should become involved in the European war under circumstances
                            such as would call for Japan to act under its interpretation of its
                            obligations, Japan would feel obliged to discharge those obligations,
                            much as Japan would regret taking up arms against the United States.
                            Colonel Iwakuro explained, however, that the situation as he saw it was
                            this: For ten years relations between Japan and the United States had
                            been deteriorating; at the present time there were two sources of
                            possible conflict between the two countries. One source was matters
                            affecting the Pacific region and the other source was through
                            circumstances under which the United States might become involved in the
                            European war. The proposed understanding was designed to take care of
                            the first source. It did not provide freedom from anxiety from the
                            second source. When world affairs are developing as rapidly as they are
                            now it is difficult to tell what contingencies might arise in the future
                            and it is impossible to cover in the text of any agreement all possible
                            contingencies that might arise. The best that we can hope for is that
                            the proposed agreement will improve the atmosphere between the two
                            countries and in this way the two countries might be expected to
                            collaborate toward contributing toward the restoration of world
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that we would take note of the Japanese desire to have
                            deleted the second sentence of the first paragraph of our draft, as the
                            Japanese had already indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi next said that the Japanese would like to have withdrawn our
                            annex containing excerpts from the Secretary’s address of April 24,
                            1941, in elaboration of our Government’s position in regard to
                            self-defense. Colonel Iwakuro said that they had no objections to the
                            speech itself, but that if it were placed in the annex Mr. Matsuoka
                            would be likely to ask to have his statements in regard to Japan’s
                            obligations under the Tripartite Pact included in an annex <pb n="458"
                                xml:id="pg_458" facs="0524"/>on the part of the Japanese Government.
                            Mr. Wakasugi said that it would be difficult for Mr. Matsuoka to accept
                            the Secretary’s statement as an integral part of the agreement. When Mr.
                            Hamilton said that it was our desire to avoid any possible
                            misunderstanding on the part of Japan as to our position, Colonel
                            Iwakuro proposed that the Embassy might communicate the Secretary’s
                            statement separately to the Japanese Government as indicating the
                            position of our Government. Mr. Hamilton said that we would take note of
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then proposed the inclusion of an annex on the part of the
                            Government of the United States reading as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Annex and Supplement on the Part of
                                the Government of the United States</hi></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. The attitudes of both Governments
                                toward the European war</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States declares that, so far as its attitude
                            toward the European war is concerned, it does not and will not resort to
                            any aggression aimed to assist any one nation against another.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">Colonel Iwakuro said that the Japanese would be quite
                            prepared to drop the foregoing suggestion if we on our part would be
                            prepared to drop our proposed sentence in the first paragraph reading,
                            “Obviously, the provisions of the Pact do not apply to involvement
                            through acts of self-defense.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that they desired to have inserted at the beginning of
                            Section II a new paragraph reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It being the common aim of both Governments of Japan and the
                                    United States to establish world peace, they will join forces
                                    with a view to preventing the extension of the European war and
                                    restoring peace.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton raised for consideration the question of whether the idea
                            underlying the proposed paragraph could not be incorporated in the first
                            section. He pointed out that an express reference of this kind under
                            Section II, which deals with the attitude of the two countries to the
                            European war, might be regarded as inconsistent with the President’s
                            declared attitude in regard to the question of a present American effort
                            to bring about peace in Europe. He suggested also for consideration
                            whether it might not serve the purpose desired to change the word “our”
                            to “all” in the first paragraph of Section I, which in our draft reads
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Both Governments affirm that their national policies are
                                    directed to [<hi rend="italic">toward</hi>] the foundation of a
                                    lasting peace and the inauguration of a new era of reciprocal
                                    confidence and cooperation among our peoples.”</p>

                        <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that they would leave this point for further
                            consideration and that we might also consider whether the words could
                            not be incorporated in some other section or in a section by itself.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Section III, Mr. Wakasugi proposed an entirely

                        <p>The reason adduced by Mr. Wakasugi for this change was that it was
                            desired to avoid giving any impression to the Japanese people that there

                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese then offered an alternative formula, concerning which they
                            wished to make reservations on minor points, reading as follows: <quote

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton then asked Colonel Iwakuro whether it was his conception
                            that upon the conclusion of this agreement it would be the Wang
                            Ching-wei regime or the Government at Chungking which would constitute
                            the Government of China.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that the Japanese now recognized the Wang Ching-wei
                            regime as the Government of China and regarded the Government at
                            Chungking as a local regime. The proposed understanding contemplated
                            negotiations by the Japanese Government with Chungking. As regards the
                            outcome of the negotiations, there were three possibilities, which he
                            charted on a piece of paper, attached:<note n="39" xml:id="d261fn39">Not
                                printed.</note> (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the Chungking

                            Chungking Government might be coalesced into a new government. The
                            Japanese Government proposed to leave this matter to be decided by the

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi explained that, with reference to caption three of the
                            foregoing annex, the Japanese did not wish to expand the wording in the
                            caption beyond the mere statement “economic cooperation”, as they wished
                            to leave the matter to be dealt with by negotiations between Japan and
                            China. Mr. Hamilton observed that in the Japanese Oral Explanation of
                            May 12 this point had been expanded by the statement “by which Japan
                            does not intend to exercise economic monopoly in China nor to demand of
                            China a limitation in the interests of Third Powers” and that we had
                            substituted the phraseology “by which China and Japan will proceed on
                            the basis of non-discrimination in international commercial relations”
                            in the interest of clarity. Mr. Hamilton here emphasized the importance
                            which this Government attached to the application of the principle of
                            non-discrimination in international commercial relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton noted that in caption six where we had suggested the wording
                            “military and naval forces” the Japanese in their new draft had restored
                            the term “troops”. He asked whether it was not intended by Japan to
                            withdraw their naval forces. Colonel Iwakuro said that in normal
                            international intercourse war vessels visited ports of other countries,
                            and, moreover, at Shanghai foreign powers, including the United States,
                            normally maintained marines or corresponding naval units. They had used
                            the English word “troops” as translation of the Japanese term “guntai”
                            which was not restricted to army forces. He said that it was Japan’s
                            clear intention to withdraw all armed forces whether of the army or the
                            navy engaged in the present hostilities, and he had no objection to the
                            use of the term “armed forces” if that would cover better what was
                            meant. He added that it was his understanding that “Chinese territory”
                            included Chinese territorial waters.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that we would take note of all the points made in
                            connection with Section III and the annex pertaining thereto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that the Japanese had no changes to offer with respect
                            to the text of Section IV, but that they desired the withdrawal of our
                            annex relating to restrictions upon trade during the present
                            international emergency. He stated that such an annex would weaken the
                            force of the stipulation in Section IV. He said that they thought that
                            the word “available” in section IV would cover what we had in mind. Mr.
                            Hamilton said that we would make note of the point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that they wished to offer an alternative wording for
                            Section V. The formulae of our draft of May 31 and of the Japanese

                        <p>Asked what were the reasons for the proposed changes, Colonel Iwakuro
                            explained that Japan had no suspicion that the United States would
                            engage in activities other than peaceful in the Southwest Pacific area,
                            and he felt that the United States should accept Japanese declarations
                            in regard to the peaceful character of their aims. The reason for
                            restricting the application of this section to the Southwestern Pacific
                            area, which we had broadened to include <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463"
                                facs="0529"/>the whole Pacific area, was that it was the Japanese
                            desire to devote this section specifically to the Southwestern Pacific
                            area on account of the special interest which the Japanese people had
                            developed therein. He pointed out that Section VI covered the whole
                            Pacific area. Mr. Hamilton raised the question whether the pledge in
                            regard to peace might be incorporated in Section VI, retaining, however,
                            in Section V a statement pledging both countries to the application of
                            non-discrimination in international commercial relations. He emphasized
                            the importance which this Government attached to such statements. He
                            pointed out in reference to commercial relations that in an earlier
                            draft we had proposed the wording “on the basis of equality of
                            opportunity”; that the Japanese had objected to that phraseology on the
                            ground that Japanese had no clear concept of the implications of the
                            term; and that, as we had been given to understand that the Japanese
                            would not object if we used phraseology contained in a recent speech by
                            the Secretary, we had in our draft of May 31 substituted such
                            phraseology. Mr. Hamilton said that we would make note of the question
                            of a possible change in the draft.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Section VI, Mr. Wakasugi offered an alternate draft,
                            which includes an additional paragraph. The formulae of our draft of May

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s apartment at 8:30 by
                            appointment made at the Ambassador’s request. He was accompanied by
                            Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that when he had examined our draft of May 31 he had
                            felt that our respective views were close together, and he went to New
                            York with the feeling that the “drafting committee” would be able to
                            carry on the work of ironing out the details. He therefore regretted
                            that it was necessary to trouble the Secretary about the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and Colonel Iwakuro both emphasized that not only they
                            individually but the Japanese Government were sincerely desirous of
                            concluding the understanding as speedily as possible. They thought that
                            perhaps there had been some misunderstanding on our part as to the
                            attitude of the Japanese Government. They felt convinced that even
                            Matsuoka, notwithstanding his part in the conclusion of the Tripartite
                            Pact, was sincerely desirous of establishing amicable relations with the
                            United States, and that such an attitude was clearly revealed in their
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was glad to hear this; that he had no doubt
                            whatever in his mind about the complete sincerity and the real purpose
                            of the Ambassador and his associates present. He said that he felt that
                            at this juncture when the world was on the brink of collapse our two
                            Governments ought to be able to get together and achieve something to
                            save the world through providing for the restoration of world trade on a
                            sound basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary discussed our desire to lay the foundation for peace in the
                            Pacific, with which question were involved the relations of our two
                            countries to Europe. The Secretary went over again the position of this
                            Government in regard to self-defense. He emphasized our determination to
                            prevent Nazi Germany from getting control of the seas. He expressed the
                            view that Japan in our position would take the same attitude and he
                            added that if Japan were situated where England is we would in the
                            interest of our self-defense feel it necessary to help Japan as we are
                            helping England.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether it would not be possible for the President,
                            having in view not merely America’s own interest but a wider interest in
                            the peace of the world, to act on his own initiative in proposing to the
                            Chinese Government that it enter into negotiations with Japan. Colonel
                            Iwakuro added that this suggestion was prompted by the idea that it
                            would better befit Japan’s dignity as <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466"
                                facs="0532"/>a great power if there could be avoided any appearance
                            that Japan was coming around to the United States in a suppliant
                            attitude asking the United States to help in settling difficulties
                            between Japan and China. He thought that we might feel the same way
                            about going around to England and asking England to help straighten out,
                            for example, a dispute that might arise between the United States and
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that in his opinion the President should have an
                            agreement of the character we had in mind to stand on before undertaking
                            to make an approach to the Chinese Government. He dwelt on the need of
                            drawing up the proposed agreement in clear-cut and unequivocal terms so
                            that the agreement would speak for itself. He said that this was
                            especially important at this time when the world has had so much
                            experience with bad faith in international dealings and when there was
                            so much skepticism and suspicion among the public in regard to matters
                            concerned with international relations. The Secretary emphasized that he
                            would like an agreement which would stand out as a monument to wise and
                            farsighted statesmanship and that he was not interested in an agreement
                            of a temporizing character which would not contain promise for future
                            stability along sound progressive lines. The Secretary then reviewed
                            briefly our reactions to the revisions proposed by the Japanese on June
                            4, along lines set forth in the attached copy of an oral statement<note
                                n="40" xml:id="d262fn40"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> the
                            original of which the Secretary handed to the Ambassador. The Secretary
                            referred specifically to the proposed omission both in the section
                            relating to China and in the section relating to the Pacific area of
                            clear-cut provisions in regard to non-discrimination in international
                            commercial relations. He referred also to the weakening effect of the
                            proposed revisions upon the emphasis which we had desired to place upon
                            a pledge of peace in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador and Mr. Wikawa read over together the oral statement and
                            told Colonel Iwakuro of the gist thereof. Colonel Iwakuro then said that
                            he himself was very much surprised to learn that we felt that the two
                            sides were not approaching closer together on a meeting of minds. He
                            himself had felt when he left us on June 4 that we had crossed the
                            mountain and the valley which separated us and that only a ditch
                            remained to be bridged. He wondered whether there was not some
                            misunderstanding on our part as to their attitude and he was now forced
                            to ask himself whether the valley and the mountain had been crossed as
                            he had hoped. The Ambassador said that he had had many talks with the
                            Secretary and felt that he understood perfectly the Secretary’s views in
                            regard to the principles <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0533"/>and
                            that the Ambassador and his associates were in general agreement with
                            the Secretary in regard to those principles. The Ambassador said that
                            what he now proposed to do was to examine carefully our oral statement
                            which we had given him and review the proposed revisions in the light of
                            the oral statement.… No arrangement was made for any further
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro in an aside to Mr. Ballantine made reference to Mr.
                            Wakasugi’s having been brought into the meeting on June 4. He said that
                            Mr. Wakasugi had been brought back from retirement by Admiral Nomura.
                            Mr. Ballantine took what Colonel Iwakuro said as a hint that the Colonel
                            feared that perhaps Mr. Wakasugi’s presence might have been prejudicial
                            rather than helpful.</p>

                        <p>From the outset of the informal and exploratory conversations which the
                            Secretary of State and the Japanese Ambassador have had, the Secretary
                            of State has consistently pointed out that if the Government of Japan
                            should decide to adopt courses which are in conformity with principles
                            which the Government of the United States believes constitute the only
                            basis for sound international relations the problem of reaching a
                            satisfactory understanding between the United States and Japan should
                            not present insuperable difficulties.</p>
                        <p>As these conversations have proceeded the practical application of the
                            principles supported by this Government to the concrete problems which
                            affect the relations of the two countries has been gone into. As the
                            Secretary of State has stressed, the basic problem is to insure peace in
                            the Pacific area. Involved in this are the question of the relations of
                            the United States and Japan to the European war and the question of the
                            Chinese-Japanese conflict. After a careful study of the documents which
                            the Japanese Ambassador handed the Secretary of State on May 12, the
                            Secretary of State offered on May 31 certain suggested revisions
                            designed to make stand out the underlying purpose of the proposed
                            understanding as an instrument of peace. It was his thought that in this
                            way the document would speak for itself, and make it unnecessary for the
                            two Governments to explain to those who might be inclined to be critical
                            what the document was intended to mean.</p>
                        <p>From such study as it has so far been possible to make of the revisions
                            which the associates of the Japanese Ambassador offered on June 4 <pb
                                n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0534"/>it is disappointing to note a
                            vast difference between the proposal as it now stands with these
                            revisions and the original document on which earlier discussions were
                            based. The successive Japanese revisions appear to have gradually
                            narrowed down the extent of the advances in the direction of a liberal
                            policy and to have carried the proposal away from the fundamental points
                            which the Government of the United States considers are involved in
                            establishing and preserving peaceful conditions in the Pacific area. The
                            impression that the Secretary of State derives from the proposed
                            revisions as a whole and from recent manifestations of the Japanese
                            Government’s attitude is that they evince a disposition (1) to stress
                            Japan’s alignment with the Axis, (2) to avoid giving a clear indication
                            of an intention to place Japan’s relations with China on a basis which
                            in the opinion of the Government of the United States would contribute
                            to a lasting peace and thus to future stability in the Far East, and (3)
                            to veer away from clear-cut commitments in regard to policies of peace
                            and of nondiscriminatory treatment which are the fundamentals of a sound
                            basis for peace in the Pacific area. As the Secretary of State has
                            indicated, this Government has not wished to take an initiative in
                            commenting upon the merits of the proposed peace terms between Japan and
                            China; comment has been offered upon this matter because under the
                            proposed understanding this Government would be expected to take some
                            action with regard to those terms.</p>
                        <p>Referring again expressly to the revisions which the associates of the
                            Japanese Ambassador offered on June 4, the Secretary of State is always
                            ready to consider suggestions as to ways in which ideas may be more
                            accurately and effectively expressed. Before proceeding to further
                            consideration of suggested phraseological changes, however, it would
                            seem important that there be a meeting of minds and mutual understanding
                            of the underlying purposes of the proposed understanding. With this in
                            view, it is suggested that the Japanese Ambassador review the
                            suggestions proposed by the Ambassador’s associates from the point of
                            view which the Secretary of State has endeavored to bring out in the
                            foregoing comments.</p>

                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro endeavored to draw Mr. Ballantine out by seemingly casual
                            questions on the attitude of the Department to the Japanese <pb n="469"
                                xml:id="pg_469" facs="0535"/>proposal as it now stood, such as, how
                            are things going and has there been any opposition in the Department to
                            an agreement such as is proposed. Mr. Ballantine replied that the
                            Secretary is the State Department and speaks for this Government in
                            matters of foreign policy and that in this way our Government is
                            integrated differently from Japan’s. Mr. Ballantine said that he was not
                            in position to add anything beyond what the Secretary said on June 6 to
                            the Colonel and to the Ambassador; that he would be glad to go over any
                            points which were not clear in what the Secretary had said; that he
                            desired at all times to be helpful and would be glad to communicate to
                            the Secretary anything they might wish to say but could not undertake to
                            express an attitude on any points which they might bring up.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that they had understood very well what the
                            Secretary had said on June 6 and the contents of the oral statement left
                            with them. He then proceeded to say that they had given much thought to
                            our proposed sentence in the first paragraph of Section II, reading,
                            “Obviously, the provisions of the Pact do not apply to involvement
                            through acts of self-defense.” He said that in suggesting that this
                            sentence be deleted the Japanese did not wish to imply that they did not
                            recognize our right of self-defense; that that right is so universally
                            recognized that its inclusion in the proposed agreement seemed
                            superfluous; and that being superfluous its inclusion would merely raise
                            difficult questions for Japan at home. Moreover, he felt personally that
                            the relations of Japan and the United States to the European war were
                            not an important factor in the relations of the two countries to each
                            other and that the tenor of any interpretation that Japan might have
                            occasion to make in regard to its obligations under the Tripartite Pact
                            as these obligations should relate to Japan’s relations with the United
                            States would be influenced by the fact of Japan’s having concluded the
                            proposed agreement with the United States. He repeated what he had said
                            on June 4 that Japan could not undertake to provide in any agreement now
                            for all possible situations that might arise in which the United States
                            might consider its self-defense involved. He said that they took no
                            exception in any way to what the Secretary had said in regard to this
                            Government’s attitude on the question.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro stated that they now proposed to accept our redraft of
                            the section in regard to peace in the Pacific area. With regard to
                            mutual pledges that the activities of the two countries in the Pacific
                            area should be conducted by peaceful means, he proposed to include
                            something on this in the preamble rather than in Section V, where such
                            phraseology was included in our draft. He did not indicate definitely
                            how they proposed to deal with our suggestion for <pb n="470"
                                xml:id="pg_470" facs="0536"/>inclusion in Section V of mutual
                            pledges of respect for the principle of non-discrimination in
                            international commercial intercourse in the Pacific area, but Mr.
                            Ballantine gathered that the Japanese would agree to retaining the
                            pledges. In Section III of the Japanese Annex, in regard to China, he
                            proposed to put back under caption three of Japan’s peace terms to China
                            the phraseology originally proposed in the Japanese oral explanation of
                            May 12, namely, “Economic cooperation—by which Japan does not intend to
                            exercise economic monopoly in China nor to demand of China a limitation
                            in the interest[s] of Third Powers”. He said that the Japanese desired
                            to retain the language used by Prince Konoe in his statement of the
                            three principles for a settlement of the conflict with China.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro explained more clearly the reference which the Ambassador
                            and he had made on June 6 to an initiative by the President vis-à-vis
                            China. What they meant was that it should be made to appear that, as the
                            United States had now reached an agreement with Japan providing for
                            peaceful relations between them in the Pacific, it only remained to
                            dispose of the conflict between China and Japan to clear up the
                            situation in the Far East and that accordingly the President on his own
                            initiative desired to propose to China that China seek a peaceful
                            settlement with Japan. Colonel Iwakuro did not indicate whether the
                            Japanese had a new formula in mind on this point.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question of the retention of Japanese troops in China
                            for the proposed cooperative action with China in resisting communistic
                            activities, Japan could not agree to limit the retention of troops in
                            China for this purpose for one or two years, but he explained that, as
                            the Japanese did not wish to keep troops in China longer than necessary,
                            the troops would be withdrawn as soon as the cause for keeping them
                            there should cease to exist.</p>
                        <p>The Colonel concluded by saying that he was not holding anything back but
                            would be glad to speak his mind freely to us in regard to any points we
                            might wish to raise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wikawa indicated that the Japanese were preparing new revised drafts
                            which they would give to us. Mr. Ballantine thanked the Colonel and Mr.
                            Wikawa for their frank and detailed comments and said he would report
                            fully to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The atmosphere of the interview was entirely cordial.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and his associates<note n="41a"
                                xml:id="d265fn41a">Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa.</note> called at
                            the Secretary’s apartment by appointment made at the Japanese
                            Ambassador’s request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, after some preliminary observations, said that he desired
                            to assure the Secretary that he was absolutely sure that the Japanese
                            Government was sincerely desirous of concluding the proposed
                            understanding with the United States, and that he was also sure that in
                            the higher Army and Navy circles in Japan there was no feeling of
                            hostility toward the United States. The Ambassador then went on to say
                            that he considered it a matter of urgency that he now report to his
                            Government in regard to how matters stood with respect to our
                            conversations and that he would like to come to an understanding with
                            the Secretary as to what were the points in the Japanese proposal on
                            which we were agreed and what were the points on which we differed so
                            that he could inform his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he believed that such a procedure might give
                            rise to misundertanding on the part of the Japanese Government and that
                            he thought that in the interest of the Japanese themselves it would be
                            preferable for the Japanese Ambassador in anything he might consider it
                            desirable to report to his Government on the progress of our
                            conversations to base such report on his own judgment as to the
                            situation. The Secretary pointed out that the Ambassador and his
                            associates had had a number of conversations with the Secretary and
                            other officers of this Government, and that in those conversations our
                            attitude in respect to the various points had been made clear.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred also to the fact that there was also involved the
                            question of our sounding out the Chinese Government in regard to this
                            matter before any definitive steps could be taken. In the course of the
                            conversation the Ambassador, in reply to a question by the Secretary as
                            to the Ambassador’s estimate of the likelihood that the Chinese
                            Government would find acceptable the Japanese terms as communicated to
                            us, replied in the same tenor as he had done on a previous occasion that
                            the Chungking Government was in a weakened position, and was only being
                            sustained by American help, and that if we withdrew this help, Chiang
                            Kai-shek would be obliged to accept Japanese terms.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed a wish to have discussions continued between his
                            associates and officers of the Department. The Secretary asked Mr.
                            Ballantine to arrange to keep in touch with the Ambassador’s
                            associates.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine met Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa at the
                            latter’s apartment in pursuance of an arrangement made earlier in the
                            day after the Japanese Ambassador had expressed to the Secretary the
                            wish that such a meeting might be held as soon as possible for further
                            conversations. Mr. Matsudaira was also present.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese asked whether we could base our conversation upon a
                                paper<note n="42" xml:id="d266fn42"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Infra</hi>.</note> which they said they had received the previous
                            day … and which we found to be a redraft of the Japanese draft of June
                                8.<note n="43" xml:id="d266fn43">Japanese draft of June 8 not
                                printed.</note> As the paper was one which we had not previously
                            seen, it was suggested to the Japanese that we defer discussing it until
                            a subsequent occasion after we had had an opportunity to have copies
                            made and to study the paper. This was agreed to and the Japanese let us
                            have the paper to keep overnight.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the subject of the application to Japanese
                            practices in China of the principle of non-discrimination in
                            international commercial relations. We emphasized that we were not
                            trying to argue points which had been under discussion between our two
                            Governments, but we thought it necessary to explore the subject in order
                            that we might be sure that we had an identity of understanding as to
                            what this principle meant. We referred to the special companies which
                            the Japanese had organized to carry on operations of a monopolistic
                            character, to the system of exchange, currency, and trade control which
                            the Japanese have established in north China and which operates to place
                            Japanese trade and enterprise in that region in a preferential position
                            over the trade and enterprise of third countries, and to the
                            restrictions upon trade and travel in China imposed by the Japanese
                            authorities which operate to interfere with the trade of third
                            countries. The Japanese denied that the two special Japanese companies
                            which we mentioned (the North China Development Company and the Central
                            China Promotion Company) had a monopolistic character, as they averred
                            that there was no restriction upon <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                                facs="0539"/>the purchase of shares of those companies by
                            foreigners; they did not deny that subsidiaries of these companies had
                            exclusive privileges in certain fields of economic activity, but they
                            said that these companies were Chinese with not more than fifty percent
                            Japanese participation. We said that we were not making any point as to
                            whether Japanese companies permitted foreign capital to invest therein,
                            but our contention was that so long as enterprise of third countries was
                            prevented from competing there existed preference in favor of Japan
                            which was contrary to our conception of non-discrimination.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese admitted that owing to hostilities there were restrictions
                            upon the movement of goods, but they said that these restricttions would
                            be removed as soon as hostilities should cease. They would not admit
                            that there were general restrictions upon the trade activities of
                            American firms. When we raised the point in regard to difficulties
                            experienced by American firms in obtaining raw silk because of the
                            preferential position occupied by the Central China Silk Company, one of
                            the special Japanese-supported companies to which we had referred, Mr.
                            Wikawa said that he was sure that this company, in the formation of
                            which his bank had had a part, was not monopolistic in character and
                            that there was no reason why its operations should preclude American
                            participation in the silk business in China.</p>
                        <p>Further discussion was postponed until the following day.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Japan accept joint
                            responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general agreement
                            of understanding as expressed in a joint declaration for the resumption
                            of traditional friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is the
                            sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led to the
                            deterioration of amicable sentiment between their countries should be
                            prevented from recurrence and corrected in their unforeseen and
                            unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is our earnest hope that, by a cooperative effort, the United States
                            and Japan may contribute effectively toward the establishment and
                            preservation of peace in the Pacific area and, by the rapid consummation
                            of an amicable understanding, encourage world peace and arrest, if not
                            dispel, the tragic confusion that now threatens to engulf
                            civilization.</p>

                        <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem ill-suited
                            and weakening. Both Governments, therefore, desire that adequate
                            instrumentalities should be developed for the realization of a general
                            understanding which would bind, meanwhile, both Governments in honor and
                            in act.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the two Governments that such an understanding should
                            comprise only the pivotal issues of urgency and not the accessory
                            concerns which could be deliberated later at a Conference.</p>
                        <p>Both Governments presume to anticipate that they could achieve harmonious
                            relations if certain situations and attitudes were clarified or
                            improved; to wit: <list>

                            reciprocal confidence and cooperation between our peoples.</p>
                        <p>Both Governments declare that it is their traditional, and present,
                            concept and conviction that nations and races compose, as members of a
                            family, one household living under the ideal of universal concord
                            through justice and equity; each equally enjoying rights and admitting

                            of social order and national life will continue to be preserved and

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine met Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa in
                            pursuance of an arrangement agreed upon the previous evening. Mr.
                            Matsudaira was also present. The conversation of the previous evening
                            was continued at the point at which it had been left off.</p>
                        <p>With regard to exchange and currency control, Colonel Iwakuro said he
                            felt that upon the conclusion of a peace settlement this matter would
                            rest with the Chinese Government as provided in paragraph four of the
                            “Agreed Terms of Understanding” in connection with the <pb n="477"
                                xml:id="pg_477" facs="0543"/>stipulations of the protocol annexed to
                            the treaty concluded by the Japanese Government with the Wang Ching-wei
                            regime. He said, in reply to questions, that the Japanese Government
                            would, of course, in connection with the withdrawal of its troops, enter
                            into arrangements with China providing for the redemption by Japan of
                            the military script issued by the Japanese in central China and also of
                            the Federal Reserve currency issued in north China. When asked how he
                            interpreted the provision in paragraph four of the “Agreed Terms of
                            Understanding” to the effect that control by China of its foreign trade
                            must not affect the principle of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation,
                            Colonel Iwakuro pointed out that the Japanese must be allowed to operate
                            the mines and other economic enterprises which they had acquired in
                            north China and which they had paid for, as Japan depended upon these
                            enterprises for the supply of vital raw materials which Japan lacked and
                            which Japan needed. He said that the economic provisions of the peace
                            terms which they desired to seek from the Chungking Government were
                            along the lines of those in the treaty with the Wang Ching-wei regime.
                            He expressed his conviction that those terms were unprecedentedly
                            generous, that Japan was getting no indemnities and no territory, but he
                            felt that Japan should at least be secure in these mining and other
                            properties and that as Japan had paid for them they should not be in
                            danger of confiscation by the Chinese Government. He hoped that we would
                            consider these properties as lying outside the scope of the principle of
                            non-discrimination. He said, otherwise, so far as trade was concerned,
                            there would be no discrimination or preferences in favor of Japan.
                            Colonel Iwakuro said that the Japanese would be very glad to consider
                            any suggestion that we might have to offer with regard to a formula for
                            dealing with these economic questions. We said that we would consider
                            what the Japanese had said and we might have further questions to ask
                            them at a later meeting.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to the question of retention of Japanese
                            troops in connection with cooperation with China in resistance against
                            communistic activities. We went over again the same ground that we had
                            previously covered again and again on this subject. Colonel Iwakuro
                            finally said that they could not fix a time limit within which they
                            would undertake to withdraw troops retained in Inner Mongolia and North
                            China for this purpose, that they desired to present this matter to the
                            Chinese Government as a part of the general settlement and not at some
                            future date just prior to completion of withdrawal of their troops, and
                            that the retention of troops in China for resistance against communistic
                            activities was an absolute point on which the Japanese Government would
                            have to insist. He hoped that we could devise some formula in which
                            possible criticisms from the American public might be met.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the formula covering the relations of Japan and the United
                            States with the European war, Mr. Wikawa offered a tentative thought
                            which he wished us to consider, reading as follows: <quote

                        <p>Conformably with an arrangement made earlier in the day, Mr. Hamilton,
                            Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Schmidt<note n="43a" xml:id="d269fn43a">Max W.
                                Schmidt, of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs.</note> met with
                            Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa at the latter’s apartment.<note n="44"
                                xml:id="d269fn44">Mr. Matsudaira was also present.</note></p>
                        <p>Asked by Colonel Iwakuro whether we had any suggestions, Mr. Ballantine
                            suggested a rewording of paragraph one of section two on the basis of
                            wording which the Japanese had proposed in their draft of June 8<note
                                n="45" xml:id="d269fn45">Not printed.</note> for inclusion in the
                            third paragraph of the preamble with the addition of the word
                            “unprovoked” … Section two, paragraph one, as reworded would thus read
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of Japan maintains that the purpose of the
                                    Tripartite Pact was, and is, defensive and is designed to
                                    contribute to the prevention of the unprovoked extension of the
                                    European war.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">In reply to the question whether this represented
                            everything which we desired in this paragraph, Mr. Ballantine said that
                            these suggestions were purely tentative. He added, however, that this
                            rewording was only part of an idea which we wished to discuss. The
                            Japanese had objected to the incorporation of excerpts from the
                            Secretary of State’s speech in the Annex and Supplement on the part of
                            the Government of the United States drafted May 31, 1941. It had
                            occurred to us that there might be arranged an exchange of letters in
                            which the Secretary of State would set forth fully the attitude of <pb
                                n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0545"/>the United States toward the
                            European war and would incorporate parts of his speech clarifying that
                            attitude. The Japanese would then on their part reply to this
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that the reaction in Japan to the incorporation of
                            statements from the Secretary’s speech would be unfavorable, whether in
                            the form of an exchange of letters or as an annex and supplement to the
                            agreement, and he urged that this question be set aside for
                            clarification after the agreement had been reached and an atmosphere of
                            cordiality created in the relations between Japan and the United States.
                            He added that they had already fully informed the Japanese Government of
                            the attitude of the United States toward the European conflict as
                            expressed in speeches by the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wikawa asked what type of reply would be expected and whether it
                            would be “secret” or “published”. Mr. Hamilton said that he did not
                            believe the reply could be treated as “secret” but that it need not
                            necessarily be published.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton inquired if it would be possible, as the Secretary of State
                            had suggested, for Japan by some unilateral act to indicate that it
                            appreciates and understands the attitude of the United States toward the
                            European war and realizes that that attitude is based on self-defense.
                            In reply, Colonel Iwakuro asked whether the United States would
                            entertain an expression by Japan of its own views of self-defense. Mr.
                            Hamilton immediately pointed out that this question was not one merely
                            of self-defense for Japan and that it would not have arisen except for
                            the Japanese attitude toward the European war as expressed by the
                            conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. Colonel Iwakuro then said that Japan
                            would want to send a letter incorporating various statements which had
                            been made by Japanese leaders. Mr. Hamilton expressed the opinion that
                            such a reply would probably not lead to a meeting of minds.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro discussed at some length the deterioration of relations
                            between the United States and Japan and the division of opinion in
                            Japanese circles which had preceded the conclusion of the Tripartite
                            Pact. The attitude of the United States, Colonel Iwakuro said, had left
                            to Japan no other course than to sign the Tripartite Pact. For this
                            reason, he said, it was most desirable that an improvement in
                            American-Japanese relations be accomplished before taking up the
                            consideration of such detailed controversial issues. He stated
                            emphatically that Japan cannot at this time repudiate the Tripartite
                            Alliance. He felt that once “good feeling” had been restored, other
                            differences would be satisfactorily ironed out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton suggested that we take careful note of what had been said
                            and that we turn to the consideration of economic matters. The question
                            of Japanese special companies, particularly the North <pb n="480"
                                xml:id="pg_480" facs="0546"/>China Development Company and the
                            Central China Promotion Company, was brought up. Speaking
                            hypothetically, Mr. Ballantine inquired whether American companies would
                            be allowed to operate similar enterprises to those engaged in by
                            subsidiary concerns. Colonel Iwakuro replied that Japan’s policy was to
                            welcome other companies and that they would be allowed to operate
                            similar enterprises. Regarding present monopolies, Mr. Wikawa said that
                            under Chinese law companies engaged in certain enterprises must
                            necessarily have more than fifty percent Chinese ownership, but that
                            with this exception there were no restrictions or monopolies and that
                            Japan’s policy would be strictly in accordance with Chinese law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton pointed out that we are continually receiving reports which
                            indicate that American citizens engaged in business enterprises in
                            occupied China are very bitter because of the Japanese restrictions and
                            obstructions interfering with the prosecution of their business affairs.
                            He inquired how we could justify the Japanese acts to these American
                            businessmen. Colonel Iwakuro replied that this situation prevails but
                            that it is caused by the existence of hostilities and the necessity of
                            taking extraordinary measures for the prosecution of the hostilities. In
                            reply to a question by Mr. Hamilton, Colonel Iwakuro said that all
                            restrictions had been inspired by war conditions and that when peace had
                            been restored these restrictions would all be removed and “fair and
                            square” treatment accorded to nationals of all third powers. In reply to
                            the question whether the Japanese would consider putting in a letter or
                            an annex clarification of Japan’s intentions regarding currency,
                            equality of economic opportunity and of treatment, et cetera, the
                            Japanese said that if we would present a letter asking any questions of
                            that nature, the Japanese Government would be glad to reply fully and
                            satisfactorily. The Japanese reiterated assurances that American
                            citizens and companies would be welcomed in China and that there will be
                            no discrimination.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine then pointed out that in certain places in occupied China
                            it was possible for American citizens to do business only through the
                            agency of Japanese subjects and Japanese banks. Colonel Iwakuro said
                            that this situation also was the result of war conditions and certain
                            extraordinary circumstances deriving therefrom, for example, the
                            necessity to maintain the value of Japanese military notes circulating
                            in central China. Mr. Hamilton pointed out that our present discussion
                            was directed toward peace and therefore not concerned with the existing
                            situation and conditions. He inquired whether, when peace is restored,
                            these restrictions resulting from war exigencies would disappear at once
                            or after one year or two years and asked for an expression of whatever
                            thoughts the Japanese might have on this subject. Colonel Iwakuro
                            immediately replied that these restrictions would disappear as soon as
                            peace <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0547"/>and order were restored.
                            Mr. Hamilton asked for a more specific answer, pointing out that in 1903
                            the United States had in a treaty with China stated that
                            extraterritorial rights would be given up as soon as conditions were
                                right.<note n="46" xml:id="d269fn46">See art. XV of treaty of
                                October 8, 1903, <ref target="frus1903#pg_91"><hi rend="italic"

                                    target="frus1903#pg_98">98</ref>.</note> Colonel Iwakuro replied
                            that the exact moment of the removal of restrictions would depend upon
                            the type of transaction or commodity involved and cited the example of
                            the military notes in central China which must be taken up and converted
                            into the legal currency of China.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by Mr. Ballantine, Mr. Wikawa said that even some
                            Japanese merchants were complaining of the lack of a free market in
                            China, but that when peace and order were restored free markets would
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine brought up the question of the relations between the
                            Chinese Government at Chungking and the Government of Wang Ching-wei
                            following the negotiation of peace between Japan and the Chinese
                            Government at Chungking. Mr. Ballantine said that in a previous
                            conversation the Japanese had indicated a desire to leave to the Chinese
                            the working out of the relationship between the Government of China at
                            Chungking and the Wang Ching-wei Government at Nanking. Colonel Iwakuro
                            stated that Japan desires that representatives from both Chiang Kai-shek
                            and Wang Ching-wei be present at the negotiations of peace between Japan
                            and China and that those negotiations were to be preceded by informal
                            conversations with both parties. Mr. Hamilton suggested that such an
                            arrangement would mean that Chiang Kai-shek would probably be required
                            to recognize, at least informally, the position of Wang Ching-wei. Mr.
                            Wikawa replied that the Chinese were very clever politicians and
                            negotiators and that they would be able to get together. He added that
                            even at present, although the two groups are supposed to be entirely
                            separate, the Nanking officials fully inform Chungking of everything the
                            Japanese tell them and in many ways the two “factions” are really one
                            government. Colonel Iwakuro said that such a general peace treaty would
                            be concluded, but that the Governments of Wang Ching-wei and Chiang
                            Kai-shek would coalesce and form one Chinese Government before
                            signatures were affixed to that treaty. Mr. Hamilton said that we would
                            give careful consideration to what had been said with a view to
                            furthering future conversations.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that he would like to pose a question as to what we
                            thought of his suggestion for a statement to be incorporated in an annex
                            or an exchange of letters to the effect that the Governments of Japan
                            and of the United States mutually recognize the defensive position each
                            maintains respectively in the East Asia area and in the Western
                            Hemisphere. Mr. Hamilton pointed out that the <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0548"/>policy of this Government was to treat
                            each and every nation in the Western Hemisphere as equal sovereign
                            countries in all respects and that an era of good feeling had been
                            created in the Western Hemisphere only after the adoption of our
                            so-called Good Neighbor policy. Colonel Iwakuro’s suggestion might
                            offend some of the American Republics and would raise many difficulties.
                            As this suggestion had not been contained in any of the other drafts,
                            Mr. Hamilton believed that it would be better to leave it out.</p>
                        <p>As a second question, the Japanese asked whether a statement could not be
                            made by the United States that it has no ambitions for new political or
                            military bases in East Asia. In reply to a suggestion that the statement
                            in section six to the effect that neither Government has territorial
                            designs in the Pacific area covered this question, Colonel Iwakuro said
                            that there was in that statement no mention of military bases. Mr.
                            Hamilton pointed out that to bring up the question of military bases at
                            the present time might raise many new issues and that such questions
                            might better be left for consideration at a conference after peace had
                            been restored. Colonel Iwakuro agreed that details might be left for
                            later negotiations but urged consideration of a statement of certain
                            broad principles having to do with the question of military bases. Mr.
                            Hamilton agreed that principles which could be generally accepted might
                            be included, but that it would be better to leave all debatable
                            questions for later consideration. Colonel Iwakuro asked whether the
                            United States could make a statement that no <hi rend="italic">new</hi>
                            bases would be acquired and added that an enunciation on the part of the
                            United States of such a principle would emphasize the peaceful intent of
                            this country. Mr. Hamilton pointed out that Japan has been demanding and
                            moving toward the establishment of bases in Thailand, Indochina, Hainan
                            and other areas in the Southwest Pacific and that the American public
                            would obviously immediately object to the United States’ making such a
                            statement limiting its freedom of action under present circumstances. He
                            went on to point out that, if Japan considered the question of acquiring
                            military bases separate and apart from the renunciation of any
                            territorial designs, a new question was brought up. He asked whether
                            Japan would expect to obtain military bases in the Pacific area despite
                            the fact that Japan does not have territorial designs there. He inquired
                            whether the Japanese concept of this question included the possibility
                            of acquiring military bases. Colonel Iwakuro replied that it did not,
                            but that a statement by the United States that no new military bases
                            would be acquired by this country was closely related to Japan’s
                            possible need for military bases in the Southwest Pacific. He mentioned
                            in passing the possibility of <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0549"
                            />the United States’ acquiring a military base at Singapore and
                            requested that this question be given careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese urged that discussions be carried on with all possible speed
                            and asked when they could telegraph Tokyo. Mr. Hamilton pointed out that
                            there were outstanding three large questions: economic
                            non-discrimination in China, stationing of Japanese troops in China,
                            attitude of the two Governments toward the European war, and added that
                            the question of a statement regarding military bases presented an
                            additional serious question. He said that we would want to consider the
                            possibility of discussing these questions with Mr. Hull, but that Mr.
                            Ballantine would telephone Mr. Wikawa tomorrow with a view to arranging
                            a further discussion.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s apartment by
                            appointment made at the Secretary’s request. The Secretary handed the
                            Japanese Ambassador a complete rewrite of the draft proposal.<note
                                n="47" xml:id="d270fn47"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                    target="#pg_486">p. 486</ref>.</note> The Secretary also handed
                            the Ambassador an oral statement,<note n="48" xml:id="d270fn48"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> which he asked the Ambassador
                            to read over. After the Ambassador had read over the oral statement, the
                            Secretary elaborated on the points contained therein along lines as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>At a time when Nazi Germany had invaded some fifteen or twenty countries
                            the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs was declaring in effect that
                            measures of resistance by countries not already actually invaded would
                            call for action by Japan under the Tripartite Pact. This would be like
                            saying that if a tiger should break loose in the countryside and if a
                            villager living a mile or so away from where the tiger is committing
                            depredations and killing neighbors should go out and attack the tiger in
                            order to protect his own family the action of the villager would
                            constitute aggression.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question which had been raised by the associates of
                            the Japanese Ambassador with Mr. Hamilton in regard to American military
                            bases in the Western Pacific region, Japan had seen this country
                            gradually withdrawing from that region. The Ambassador would recall the
                            treaty into which we had entered with Japan along with other nations in
                            1922 providing for the non-fortification <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484"
                                facs="0550"/>of our territory in the Western Pacific,<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d270fn49">See art. XIX of naval treaty of February 6, 1922,

                            which treaty we had expressed our willingness to renew in 1936. How much
                            more evidence was there needed to carry conviction of our peaceful
                            intentions?</p>
                        <p>It seemed to us that the Japanese Government would decide either to
                            assume control of those elements in the Japanese body politic which
                            supported Nazi Germany and its policies of aggression or to allow those
                            elements to take over entire charge of Japan’s policies. If the Japanese
                            Government decided before it was too late that Hitler was dangerous to
                            Japan and if then Japan decided to come forward with a program which
                            offered a basis for cooperation along peaceful courses, we should be
                            glad to consider such a program.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then dwelt upon the importance of an understanding such as
                            we had been discussing at a time when the world is hovering on the brink
                            of a precipice. He said he was sure that the Ambassador shared the
                            Secretary’s views on the need of far-sighted statesmanship which would
                            look beyond just immediate advantages. The Secretary said that he was
                            leaving for the country for a few days to recuperate, but that he would
                            be where he could be reached and he said that his associates would be
                            available for consultation with the Ambassador and his associates should
                            there be any points which the Ambassador might wish to bring up with
                            them. The Ambassador said nothing significant by way of comment other
                            than that he would study the oral statement and the redraft of the
                            proposed understanding and would be glad to take up with the associates
                            of the Secretary any matters on which he might desire to seek their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The documents handed to the Japanese Ambassador are as follows:</p>

                                the request of the Japanese Ambassador, the Chief of the Division of
                                Far Eastern Affairs (Hamilton), acting under instruction from the
                                Secretary of State, accepted the return of this document from the
                                Japanese Minister (Wakasugi) on July 17, 1941. See memoranda of

                        <p>The Secretary of State appreciates the earnest efforts which have been
                            made by the Japanese Ambassador and his associates to bring about a
                            better understanding between our two countries and to establish peace in
                            the Pacific area. The Secretary of State appreciates also the frankness
                            which has characterized their attitude throughout the conversations
                            which have been held. This Government is no less desirous than the
                            Japanese Ambassador to bring about better relations between our two
                            countries and a situation of peace in the Pacific area, and in that
                            spirit the Secretary of State has given careful study to every aspect of
                            the Japanese proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State has no reason to doubt that many Japanese leaders
                            share the views of the Japanese Ambassador and his associates as
                            indicated above and would support action toward achieving those high
                            objectives. Unfortunately, accumulating evidence reaches this Government
                            from sources all over the world, including reports from sources which
                            over many years have demonstrated sincere good will toward Japan, that
                            some Japanese leaders in influential official positions are definitely
                            committed to a course which calls for support of Nazi Germany and its
                            policies of conquest and that the only kind of understanding with the
                            United States which they would endorse is one that would envisage
                            Japan’s fighting on the side of Hitler should the United States become
                            involved in the European hostilities through carrying out its present
                            policy of self-defense. The tenor of recent public statements
                            gratuitously made by spokesmen of the Japanese Government emphasizing
                            Japan’s commitments and intentions under the Tripartite Alliance
                            exemplify an attitude which cannot be ignored. So long as such leaders
                            maintain this attitude in their official positions and apparently seek
                            to influence public opinion in Japan in the direction indicated, is it
                            not illusory to expect that adoption of a proposal such as the one under
                            consideration offers a basis for achieving substantial results along the
                            desired lines?</p>
                        <p>Another source of misgiving in the Japanese proposal relates to the
                            desire of the Japanese Government to include in its terms for a peaceful
                            settlement to be offered to the Chinese Government a provision which
                            would permit the stationing of Japanese troops in certain areas in Inner
                            Mongolia and North China as a measure of cooperation with China in
                            resisting communistic activities. While this <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486"
                                facs="0552"/>Government has given careful thought to the
                            considerations which have prompted the Japanese Government to make such
                            a proposal, and while this Government does not desire to enter into the
                            merits of such a proposal, it feels that the liberal policies to which
                            the United States is committed, as explained on numerous occasions to
                            the Japanese Ambassador and his associates, would not permit this
                            Government to associate itself with any course which appears to be
                            inconsistent with these policies. Furthermore, although in matters
                            affecting only this country there might be some latitude of decision as
                            to the qualifying of rights, the matter under discussion affects the
                            sovereign rights of a third country, and accordingly it is felt that
                            this Government must be most scrupulous in dealing with such a
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State has therefore reluctantly come to the conclusion
                            that this Government must await some clearer indication than has yet
                            been given that the Japanese Government as a whole desires to pursue
                            courses of peace such as constitute the objectives of the proposed
                            understanding. This Government sincerely hopes that the Japanese
                            Government will manifest such an attitude.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Japan accept joint
                            responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general agreement
                            of understanding as expressed in a joint declaration for the resumption
                            of traditional friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is the
                            sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led to the
                            deterioration of amicable sentiment between their countries should be
                            prevented from recurrence and corrected in their unforeseen and
                            unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is our earnest hope that, by a cooperative effort, the United States
                            and Japan may contribute effectively toward the establishment and
                            preservation of peace in the Pacific area and, by the rapid consummation
                            of an amicable understanding, encourage world peace <pb n="487"
                                xml:id="pg_487" facs="0553"/>and arrest, if not dispel, the tragic
                            confusion that now threatens to engulf civilization.</p>
                        <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem ill-suited
                            and weakening. Both Governments, therefore, desire that adequate
                            instrumentalities should be developed for the realization of a general
                            understanding which would bind, meanwhile, both Governments in honor and
                            in act.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the two Governments that such an understanding should
                            comprise only the pivotal issues of urgency and not the accessory

                            improved; to wit: <list>

                                special attention to an address which I delivered on April 24
                                setting forth fully the position of this Government upon this

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called on the Secretary at the Secretary’s
                            apartment by appointment made at the Ambassador’s request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was communicating to his Government the oral
                            statement given him by the Secretary on the previous day. The Ambassador
                            said, since presenting the proposed understanding to the Secretary, that
                            he had been acting all along in accordance <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493"
                                facs="0559"/>with instructions from his Government, in whose
                            decisions the Foreign Office, the Army and Navy had participated. He
                            said that he was at a loss to account for the existence in Japan of any
                            disagreement over policy in regard to this matter, such as was referred
                            to in our oral statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether it might be possible that Matsuoka’s
                            intention was on the one hand to have us subject China to pressure to
                            come to an agreement with Japan and on the other hand to leave Japan
                            free to take action with reference to the European war as indicated in
                            Matsuoka’s message to Mussolini. The Ambassador replied as he had on
                            previous occasions that Japan did not want war with the United States,
                            but that Japan did not wish to bind itself in advance with regard to
                            some future eventuality.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed the Secretary an oral statement<note n="51"
                                xml:id="d273fn51"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> which he
                            asked Mr. Ballantine to read to the Secretary. In the oral statement the
                            suggestion was made that, as the proposed exchanges of letters attached
                            to the draft presented by the Secretary on June 21 contained points
                            which the Ambassador found difficult to recommend to his Government for
                            approval, the letters either be omitted or modified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not wish to cause embarrassment to the
                            Japanese Government, and he hoped that at the same time the Japanese
                            Government would not want to cause this Government embarrassment. He
                            remarked that he might have difficulty here over the proposed
                            understanding unless the Japanese Government could find some way of
                            clarifying its attitude in view of the public statements that had been
                            made in Japan. The Secretary asked whether Germany’s declaration of war
                            against the Soviet Union might not affect the situation in such a way as
                            to render it more easy for the Japanese Government to find some way
                            along the lines indicated.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Japanese Government did not wish to be
                            placed in the position of repudiating its obligations under the
                            Tripartite Pact. He said, however, that he would refer the matter to his
                            Government with a view to its studying what might be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine asked whether the Ambassador objected also to the draft
                            letter in regard to the application to Japan’s economic cooperation with
                            China of the principle of non-discrimination in international commercial
                            relations. The Ambassador replied in the affirmative, stating that he
                            felt that it would take too long for the purposes of the present
                            understanding to go into all the details involved, and he suggested that
                            this matter be taken up at a later time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the Japanese proposal that the question of the
                            stationing of Japanese troops for defense against communism <pb n="494"
                                xml:id="pg_494" facs="0560"/>be left for negotiation between Japan
                            and China. He pointed out that if Japan and the United States should
                            reach an agreement and if then China and Japan should not come to an
                            agreement and the matter of a settlement between China and Japan be thus
                            left hanging in the air, we would be placed in an embarrassing
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that insistence upon the stationing of Japanese
                            troops in China for the purpose indicated was a long-established policy
                            of the Japanese Government, that the matter had been one of the
                            provisions in the Wang Ching-wei treaty, approved by the Throne, and
                            that he was not able to say whether the Japanese Government could
                            reconsider this matter. The Ambassador said he would, however, inform
                            his Government in regard to what the Secretary had said and ask it to
                            give further study to this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said nothing to indicate that we would withdraw the
                            exchanges of letters, but the sense of what was said was that the
                            Japanese Ambassador would refer to his Government the points involved in
                            the letters, and the door was thus left open for us to consider any
                            alternative or modified suggestion that the Japanese Ambassador might
                            offer.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in view of the importance of the proposed
                            understanding he hoped that the Ambassador and his associates would keep
                            in touch with the Secretary’s associates, who in turn would keep the
                            Secretary informed of developments.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador appreciates deeply the earnest endeavors by the
                            Secretary of State and his associates toward the restoration of the
                            traditional friendly relations between Japan and the United States; he

                        <p>The Ambassador has studied carefully the draft of the proposed

                            the letters of exchange attached to the Annex and Supplements contain
                            points which the Ambassador feels it difficult to recommend to his
                            Government for approval, it is submitted that the letters either be
                            omitted or be suitably modified with the necessary changes in the Annex

                        <p>Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Schmidt, who were later joined by Mr. Hamilton,
                            called at the apartment of Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa by
                                arrangement<note n="51a" xml:id="d275fn51a">Mr. Matsudaira was also
                                present.</note> following an intimation … that the Japanese would
                            like to meet us for further discussion. Mr. Wikawa said that he
                            understood … it was desirable that we go on with the conversations and
                            asked if we had read the recent report of the interview which Prime
                            Minister Konoe had given a representative of the American press. The
                            Prime Minister, he said, had intended this interview to be in response
                            to the position taken by the Secretary in his oral statement of June 21;
                            and had therefore emphasized that Japan had no intention to participate
                            in or to assist any German program of world conquest, and had further
                            emphasized that he could foresee no reason for war between the United
                            States and Japan. Mr. Ballantine remarked that according to our
                            information this interview had been granted by Prince Konoe to a
                            Paramount Newsreel representative in Japan who had in turn passed on the
                            remarks of the Prime Minister to the United Press correspondent who
                            cabled a report to the United States. Our information further indicated
                            that the Prime Minister’s remarks were not published in Japan; and as
                            reported in this country, contained statements differing only very
                            slightly from those which had been made previously by Japanese
                            statesmen. Mr. Schmidt, referring to the Secretary’s oral statement of
                            June 21, added that there had been published so many remarks by leading
                            Japanese emphasizing Japan’s commitments and intentions under the
                            Tripartite Alliance, in addition to accumulating evidence from other
                            sources, that the people of the United States could not but believe that
                            certain elements in the Japanese Government wholeheartedly supported
                            Nazi Germany in its policies of conquest and those elements could
                            therefore hardly be expected to support an understanding with the United
                            States which would prevent Japan’s fighting on the side of Hitler should
                            the United States, in defense of its security, be forced to take up arms
                            against Germany. Mr. Wikawa replied that we should give attention only
                            to statements of the Japanese Ambassador to the Secretary, and said that
                            he believed that we were under some misapprehension regarding the
                            unanimity of the Japanese Government in supporting the instructions
                            given to Admiral Nomura. Mr. Wikawa was supported by Colonel Iwakuro in
                            the assertion that officials of the Japanese Army, Navy and Foreign
                            Office are united in their support of Admiral Nomura in this
                            instance.</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine emphasized that we were not raising any question of the
                            unanimity of the Japanese Government in the matter of the proposal which
                            had been presented to us, but that we felt we should have some clearer
                            indication than the Japanese Government has yet given us of its peaceful
                            intentions in order to counteract the effect of previous manifestations
                            of Japanese policy; and that we were not undertaking to suggest the
                            method by which the Japanese Government might present such concrete
                            evidence.</p>
                        <p>In a plea for mutual confidence, Mr. Wikawa stated that he had learned
                            recently that the banking firm of Morgan and Company in New York, which
                            had control of a Japanese sinking fund to purchase Japanese Government
                            bonds at a price favorable to Japan, had learned from sources within the
                            State Department that these conversations had been very politely but
                            firmly and on technical grounds closed by the United States and that the
                            freezing of Japanese funds in the United States could be expected in the
                            near future. Morgan and Company had accordingly begun the purchase of
                            Japanese Government bonds indiscriminately and had forced the price of
                            those bonds to rise considerably to the detriment of the Japanese
                            Government’s sinking fund. Mr. Wikawa said they were embarrassed by an
                            implication in the Secretary’s oral statement of June 21 of division
                            within the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa both contended, as Colonel Iwakuro had
                            done earlier in the discussion, that once an agreement had been reached
                            with the United States, it would be easier for Japan to give evidence,
                            such as we sought, of Japan’s intentions; and there would then be
                            forthcoming in succession indications showing that Japan’s purposes were
                            in harmony with the spirit of the agreement. In the meantime, however,
                            the Japanese Government was obliged to act with caution. Colonel Iwakuro
                            suggested that present world conditions were such as to call for quick
                            action, and that for this reason we should avoid taking up in detail all
                            matters at issue. The unanimity of the Japanese Government in support of
                            the proposal was again stressed by both Colonel Iwakuro and Mr.
                            Wikawa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine once more pointed out that we did not wish to question the
                            united support of the Japanese Government of the proposal which Admiral
                            Nomura made on May 12; but that the evidence which we had indicated a
                            desire on the part of at least certain elements in Japan to support Nazi
                            Germany and its program of world conquest and domination; and that we
                            merely sought some clearer indication than has yet been given that the
                            Japanese Government as a whole desires to pursue courses of peace. In an
                            effort to discount political differences in Japan, Colonel Iwakuro said
                            that there are naturally in all countries various political groups and
                            referred to the groups within <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0563"
                            />the United States favoring opposing programs in foreign relations. In
                            reply, Mr. Schmidt pointed out that the United States is unanimous in
                            its desire for strong defense against aggressors and that the position
                            of the people and of the Government of the United States repeatedly has
                            been made clear. There has been no intimation of any threat to any
                            nation in that position but only the clearest evidence of support for
                            defense against aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese again returned to their argument that it was difficult at
                            this time to make a clear-cut statement, and that the understanding
                            should be reached first. Mr. Ballantine repeated that what we had in
                            mind was not a matter of a statement or of particular words but rather
                            some practical evidence of Japan’s peaceful intentions. Mr. Ballantine
                            emphasized that Secretary Hull desired to be helpful in any way
                            possible. After further statements of the desirability of reaching an
                            understanding promptly, Mr. Wikawa suggested that the “concept of the
                            character of nations” as contained in the draft agreement clearly
                            portrayed Japan’s desire to pursue peaceful courses.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wikawa said these conversations were being kept very secret in Japan
                            owing to the opposition which could be expected from third countries and
                            from certain groups in Japan. Mr. Matsuoka’s statements and the
                            statements of other individuals were of ten largely for home
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton replied that these conversations were also kept very secret
                            here; and brought to Mr. Wikawa’s attention the fact that the President
                            and the Secretary of State in the administration of matters of policy
                            were able at times judiciously “to apply the brakes”. It seems to us,
                            Mr. Hamilton said, the Japanese Government, if it so desired, could
                            pursue a similar course to indicate more clearly that Japan is now
                            committed to a peaceful policy. He added that we do not expect the
                            impossible, of course, and do not ask Japan to repudiate contractual
                            obligations. Colonel Iwakuro again observed that in view of Japan’s
                            political agreement with Germany and Italy, it would be difficult to
                            take such steps until after an understanding had been reached with the
                            United States. Speaking frankly, the Colonel suggested that the delay in
                            these conversations was contributing to a feeling in both Japan and the
                            United States that each country was “insincere” and was “playing with
                            the other”. Colonel Iwakuro urged the fundamental consideration was to
                            dispose of any possibility of hostilities between the United States and
                            Japan. He said he felt strongly that it would be most foolish for the
                            United States and Japan to go to war and suggested with considerable
                            emphasis that first an agreement be reached to preclude that
                            possibility, and then that all other problems between the United States
                            and Japan be settled in the favorable atmosphere created by such an
                            agreement. <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0564"/>Mr. Ballantine
                            pointed out that essential points in that fundamental consideration were
                            the questions of the attitude of Japan toward the European war and of
                            Japan’s desire to pursue courses of peace.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro made the suggestion that mutual and reciprocal
                            recognition of the right of self-defense might satisfactorily obviate
                            any necessity we might feel for an exchange of letters such as contained
                            in our draft of June 21. Colonel Iwakuro followed this suggestion by
                            reference again to the desirability of reaching promptly an
                            understanding with the United States in order that a favorable
                            atmosphere might be created for the later settlement of all other
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>In replying to those remarks Mr. Hamilton pointed out that if the
                            Japanese Government intends to move toward courses which, in the opinion
                            of this Government, furnish a sound basis for relations between nations
                            there need arise no question of war between Japan and the United States.
                            He agreed with Colonel Iwakuro that if we can reach an agreement on
                            fundamentals, the solution of other problems will be facilitated. Mr.
                            Hamilton then went on to say that the Secretary had given his personal
                            attention and had devoted considerable time and effort to this question;
                            but that as a responsible statesman, the Secretary could not ignore the
                            evidence from Japan, Europe and other sources which indicates that
                            important elements in Japan desire to go in other directions than along
                            the lines of peaceful courses which we have been discussing. Mr.
                            Hamilton said that Mr. Hull is both an idealist and a practical man and
                            therefore a statesman. He added that before a responsible statesman may
                            take action there must be some evidence that the desired results of that
                            action will have at least a fair chance to materialize. Colonel Iwakuro
                            made a brief plea for mutual confidence, and then merely returned to his
                            original contention that it was difficult for Japan to go any further
                            until an understanding with the United States had been reached.</p>
                        <p>After remarking that the offer of assistance to Russia by the United
                            States was not pleasing to Japan, Colonel Iwakuro suggested as his
                            personal opinion and without knowing the views of his Government, that
                            the question of China and dealing with the “China incident” might be
                            dropped altogether until after the United States and Japan had reached
                            an agreement for peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton brought out the fact that “peace in the Pacific” is not just
                            a question involving only the United States and Japan, but that many
                            other countries are concerned; and that there could be no peace in the
                            Pacific should certain elements in Japan be able to force an attack on
                            the United States at some future stage in the development of the
                            hostilities in Europe. There followed further discussion of the same
                            character, in which the Japanese urged that an understanding <pb n="499"
                                xml:id="pg_499" facs="0565"/>be reached and that questions of a
                            detailed character be set aside in order to assure, if possible, that
                            war between Japan and the United States would be avoided; and in reply
                            to which Mr. Hamilton said that should Japan follow courses of peace
                            there was no danger of war.</p>
                        <p>After expressing our appreciation of the sincere statements which had
                            been made, Mr. Hamilton brought the discussion to a close by stating our
                            desire to be helpful in any way possible and by asking the Japanese once
                            more to study the Secretary’s most recent oral statement to see whether
                            there were any ideas or suggestions which might occur to them in the
                            light of today’s conversation.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary having directed that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine
                            endeavor to see the associates of the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Hamilton
                            and Mr. Ballantine ascertained that Mr. Wikawa was out of town, and, as
                            Colonel Iwakuro does not speak English, after consulting Mr.
                                Welles,<note n="53" xml:id="d277fn53">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary
                                of State.</note> made an appointment to see the Japanese Ambassador.
                            Through some misunderstanding on the part of the Ambassador’s Secretary,
                            Colonel Iwakuro was not asked by the Ambassador to be present and could
                            not be reached when we arrived.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that the Ambassador’s letter of July 4 addressed to the
                            Secretary was communicated to the Secretary this morning and that the
                            Secretary had asked us to make a number of comments <pb n="500"
                                xml:id="pg_500" facs="0566"/>to the Ambassador. In the first place,
                            the Department, under directions from the President, had telegraphed to
                            Ambassador Grew asking him to communicate to the Prime Minister a
                            message in which reference was made to various reports which we had
                            received to the effect that Japan had decided to attack the Soviet
                            Union, to our efforts to see peace maintained in the Pacific, and to the
                            encouragement which statements by Japanese leaders and by the Japanese
                            Ambassador had given us to hope that Japan shares our desire that the
                            peace of the Pacific might be preserved. The message to Mr. Grew
                            contained the statement that we found it difficult to credit these
                            reports which were so entirely inconsistent with the statements
                            mentioned and that we would appreciate assurances that the reports were
                            without foundation.<note n="53a" xml:id="d277fn53a">See statement of
                                July 6, 1941, by the Ambassador in Japan, <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The Ambassador listened attentively but made no comment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton went on to say that the foregoing telegram was sent before
                            the receipt by us of the Ambassador’s letter of July 4. He then observed
                            that we were always gratified to receive assurances of friendliness from
                            another government, but, presuming that the Ambassador’s letter of July
                            4 was intended to be responsive to the Secretary’s oral statement of
                            June 21, which dealt with fundamentals affecting the peace of the
                            Pacific, it was felt that it would be helpful if the Japanese Government
                            should wish to respond in some way that might suggest itself as
                            appropriate to the Japanese Government by way of meeting the fundamental
                            points brought out in the Secretary’s oral statement. Mr. Hamilton added
                            that in the oral statement we had not intended to imply that there was
                            any divergence of views in the Japanese Government in regard to the
                            matter of the proposal; but what we adverted to was evidence which had
                            reached us that certain elements of the Japanese Government favored
                            courses of support of Hitler in his movement of world conquest and not
                            courses of peace such as was the spirit of the proposed
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that the Japanese Government recognized from a
                            comparison of the Japanese proposal and our revision that there were
                            material differences in our respective views and that it was the
                            Japanese Government’s purpose to convey in the letter the Japanese
                            Government’s desire to continue conversations until we had ironed out
                            these differences on a mutually satisfactory basis. He added that the
                            question of China was a matter of much more vital importance to Japan
                            than to the United States and that in view of the effects upon public
                            opinion in Japan of decisions on China policy it was necessary for the
                            Japanese Government to move very cautiously in this matter. He said,
                            however, that he would refer our observations on these points to his
                            Government for its consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that a third point which he wished to bring up related
                            to press reports to the effect that Japan was planning to acquire naval
                            and air bases in French Indochina and Thailand to enable Japan to
                            threaten the Burma Road, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. Mr.
                            Hamilton read to the Ambassador a press clipping from the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of this morning containing a press
                            despatch from Shanghai on the subject (attached).<note n="54"
                                xml:id="d277fn54">Not printed.</note> He asked the Ambassador how
                            does the Japanese Government expect to go forward with a peace
                            settlement for the Pacific area while reports indicated that Japan is
                            moving in exactly the opposite direction? Mr. Hamilton suggested that it
                            would be advantageous at this juncture to have either a prompt denial or
                            frank confirmation of those reports.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that the Japanese Government was faced with the
                            necessity of preparing itself against possible eventualities. He
                            observed that one had only to take up the paper to read suggestions by
                            commentators in the United States on plans for the encirclement of
                            Japan; that America was aiding Chiang Kai-shek in various ways,
                            including the despatch of American pilots to Chungking; that American
                            supplies were being sent to Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies; that
                            there were visits of American squadrons to Australia which to a naval
                            man like himself were of greater significance than mere courtesy visits;
                            and that commentators were discussing the prospects of American aid to
                            the Russian Far East and of the acquisition of American air bases in
                            Siberia. He alluded also to the possibility of an executive order being
                            issued stopping the shipment from the United States of petroleum
                            products to Japan, and he remarked that, if Japan should thus be shut
                            off from American sources of oil, Japan must obtain them elsewhere and
                            that, under the circumstances, it was necessary for Japan to take
                            appropriate preparatory measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton observed that he had seen no statement from any
                            authoritative source indicating that this Government was preparing to
                            acquire bases in Siberia. He suggested also that there was a
                            considerable difference between a government’s taking preparatory
                            defense measures in its own country and acquiring bases by pressure
                            methods in some other country.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador declared that there was no doubt in his mind that the
                            Japanese Government desired peace; he said casually that he did not
                            think that the Japanese Government had any intention at the present
                            juncture to embark upon military movements against Russia or to the
                            southward. He pointed out that in the present state of relations between
                            the United States and Japan action by one country led to counteraction
                            by the other; and it was with this idea in <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502"
                                facs="0568"/>view that he felt that we should conclude the present
                            understanding as speedily as possible, as this would tend to set
                            currents in motion away from aggravation of the present tension.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton commented that the view just expressed by the Ambassador in
                            regard to the desirability of arresting trends which lead to an
                            aggravation of international friction was very statesmanlike.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton then said that we had been orally informed that the
                            associates of the Japanese Ambassador had mentioned … something about
                            Japan’s being now willing to withdraw all their troops from China within
                            two years.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he was not conversant with the details of
                            this matter. He observed, however, that Japan’s treaty with Wang
                            Ching-wei provided for the retention of Japanese troops in China for
                            defense against Communism during the period of the validity of the
                            Anti-Comintern Pact, which he said might last only two years, but
                            perhaps much longer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton in conclusion said that we regretted the arising of
                            difficulties in the course of our conversations, but that we thought it
                            desirable when such difficulties arise to discuss them frankly with the
                            Japanese Ambassador and his associates who throughout these
                            conversations have been animated by a sincere desire to bring about
                            better relations with the United States. We also said that we
                            appreciated the frankness which they in turn had consistently manifested
                            in talking with us.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by the Ambassador, Mr. Hamilton said that our
                            telegram to Mr. Grew related only to the question of a Japanese attack
                            on Siberia and that we expected a reply. The Ambassador said that he
                            would inform his Government of what we had said.</p>

                            Minister of Japan, Prince Fumimaro Konoye …</p>
                        <p>From a variety of sources reports are reaching the Government of the
                            United States that it is the intention of the Japanese Government to
                            enter upon hostilities against the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>As is well known to the Japanese Government, the maintenance and
                            preservation of peace in the area of the Pacific has been the earnest
                            desire of the American Government, which has contributed its greatest
                            efforts to the achievement of that high purpose.</p>
                        <p>From statements made in recent months by the Japanese Ambassador in
                            Washington, Admiral Nomura, to the Secretary of State, Mr. Hull, in the
                            course of conversations between them, as well as from the utterances of
                            responsible Japanese officials, the Government of the United States has
                            derived the hope that it was also the desire of the Government of Japan
                            to maintain and preserve peace in the area of the Pacific. The reports
                            which are now reaching the American Government are so completely
                            contrary to those statements and utterances that the Government of the
                            United States finds it very difficult to believe in the truth of those
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>Should Japan enter upon a course of military aggression and conquest it
                            stands to reason that such action would render illusory the cherished
                            hope of the American Government, which it understood was shared by the
                            Japanese Government, that peace in the Pacific area, far from being
                            further upset, might now indeed be strengthened and made more
                            secure.</p>
                        <p>It is the earnest hope of the Government of the United States that the
                            reports of Japan’s decision to enter upon hostilities against the Soviet
                            Union are not based upon fact, and an assurance to that effect from His
                            Excellency the Prime Minister of Japan would be deeply appreciated by
                            the Government of the United States.</p>

                        <p>At a time like this all sorts of rumours are abundantly bred not only in
                            Japan but in all countries.</p>

                            from spreading to the regions of Greater East Asia and the maintenance
                            and preservation of peace in the area of the Pacific have always been
                            the sincere and genuine desire of the Japanese Government which have
                            consistently contributed their earnest efforts toward achieving that
                            high purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government wish to state, in reply to the last paragraph of
                            the Message, that they have not so far considered the <pb n="504"
                                xml:id="pg_504" facs="0570"/>possibility of joining the hostilities
                            against the Soviet Union. The position of the Japanese Government
                            vis-à-vis the Soviet-Axis war was made clear in the Oral statement of
                            July 2nd, 1941 of H. I. M.’s Foreign Minister to the Soviet Ambassador
                            in Tokyo. One can do no better than attach hereto a copy of this Oral
                            statement for the President’s perusal in order to bring home the course
                            of policy Japan has been compelled to pursue in the present
                            circumstances. Of course, it is understood that the American Government
                            will treat it as strictly confidential. Incidentally, the Japanese
                            Government would like to avail themselves of this opportunity for
                            definitely ascertaining whether it is really the intention of the
                            President or the American Government to intervene in the European war as
                            they are naturally and very deeply concerned at the prospect, disturbed
                            as they sincerely are, by reports reaching them from a variety of
                            sources.</p>

                            <p>I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that Japan necessarily
                                feels deep concern with the German-Soviet war that has unfortunately
                                broken out. To be frank, Japan finds herself in the most awkward
                                position faced with the war between Germany and Italy, her allies,
                                on one hand, and the U. S. S. R. on the other, with whom she has but
                                recently begun to improve relations in sincere desire to promote and
                                maintain good neighbourliness. Japan is, therefore, most anxious to
                                see the termination of the hostilities at the earliest possible
                                date, earnestly wishing that they may at least be confined to
                                regions not immediately adjacent to the Far East where she possesses
                                vital interests.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government take this opportunity to state that they do
                                not at present feel compelled to modify their policy towards the U.

                                rise to misunderstandings to their allies. It is their sincere hope
                                that they will be able to pursue a course of policy carefully
                                calculated at once to serve their own interests and to preserve the
                                spirit of mutual trust among the allies, while maintaining good
                                relations with the U. S. S. R. I need hardly add that their

                        <p>During my interview with the Foreign Minister today I read to Mr.
                            Matsuoka the following:<note n="55" xml:id="d280fn55">Statement made by
                                direction of the Secretary of State.</note>

                                <p>“According to reports emanating from Tokyo, Japan is uncertain of
                                    and misunderstands American policy with respect to the recent
                                    hostilities between the Soviet Union and Germany. For example,
                                    the press quoted the War Minister as stating on June 24 that as
                                    American future policy could not be predicted, Japan was at the
                                    crossroads. The <hi rend="italic">Yomiuri</hi> reportedly feared
                                    that the United States and Great Britain contemplated using
                                    Russian territory for military purposes, thereby menacing Japan;
                                    the same journal saw unfriendliness toward Japan in American
                                    gestures toward Russia, and the <hi rend="italic">Hochi</hi>
                                    believed such friendliness implied military threats against
                                    Japan.</p>
                                <p>“The attitude of the Government of the United States regarding
                                    the war in Europe has been clearly stated many times; its
                                    purpose is to protect the security of the nation and of the
                                    Western Hemisphere; the Nazi armies are considered as being the
                                    chief threat to that security; accordingly the United States has
                                    adopted the policy of aiding Great Britain and any other nation
                                    in opposition to those armies, and will welcome any further such
                                    opposition. Therefore, any steps which the American Government
                                    may consider in aid of Russia will have as its sole aim the
                                    defense of American security, and will in no manner threaten the
                                    security of nations which have not joined the conflict on
                                    Hitler’s side.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine called on the Japanese Ambassador by
                            appointment made at their request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that we had called at the direction of the Secretary
                            who had wished us to express his regrets that being under doctor’s
                            orders he had been unable to see the Japanese Ambassador the previous
                            day when the Ambassador had called at the Secretary’s hotel in White
                            Sulphur Springs. Mr. Hamilton also said that the Secretary had asked us
                            to inform the Ambassador that we desired to place ourselves at the
                            Ambassador’s disposal for conveying to the Secretary any new impressions
                            or views that the Ambassador might have in mind to communicate.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had seen Mr. Gray<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d281fn56">Cecil W. Gray, Assistant to the Secretary.</note>
                            at the Greenbrier <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0572"/>Hotel and had
                            asked Mr. Gray to mention to the Secretary that the Ambassador had
                            received instructions from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to say that
                            there was no divergence in views among the important Government leaders,
                            including the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of War, Navy, Home
                            Affairs and Foreign Affairs, in regard to the desire to improve
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton remarked that we had not raised any question on that point,
                            but that what the Secretary had had in mind in his oral statement of
                            June 21 was evidence which had come to us that there were important
                            elements in the Japanese Government which supported a policy
                            inconsistent with the policy of peace which is the underlying purpose of
                            the proposed understanding with the United States. Mr. Hamilton said
                            that the Secretary also had in mind the question whether the Japanese
                            Government was willing to assert control over those elements in such a
                            way as to ensure the Government’s pursuing in the future a policy of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the Secretary had previously mentioned that aspect of
                            the situation and that while there might be reports circulated in
                            diplomatic circles in Tokyo to the effect that there were differences of
                            opinion on policy in the Japanese Government he (the Ambassador)
                            believed that the Japanese Government as a whole was in favor of a
                            policy of peace.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador did not indicate that he had anything further to impart
                            to us, we took our leave after a few minutes of general conversation.
                            More than once in the course of the conversation the Ambassador
                            expressed his appreciation of the Secretary’s action in asking us to
                            call on the Ambassador.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine called on the Japanese Ambassador by
                            appointment made at their request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that he had been directed by the Secretary to call and
                            to make communication to the Ambassador, as from the Secretary, on three
                            points. First, he desired to express regret that no reply had been made
                            to the oral statement which the Secretary handed the Japanese Ambassador
                            on June 21.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that the letter which he addressed to the
                            Secretary on July 4 was intended by the Japanese Government to meet our
                            oral statement of June 21. He explained that he had taken the oral
                            statement as having been addressed to himself but that nevertheless he
                            had referred it to his Government, and his Government had <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0573"/>instructed him that this Government was
                            not warranted in raising questions as to the attitude of any particular
                            individuals in the Japanese Government, for although there were
                            discussions on policy within the Japanese Government the Japanese
                            Government was acting as a unit. The Ambassador also said in Japanese
                            that his Government had considered that our oral statement contained an
                            import amounting to interference in Japan’s internal affairs in that it
                            raised the question of a reconstruction of the Japanese Cabinet.
                            Subsequently, the Ambassador repeated substantially the same statement
                            in English. Mr. Hamilton expressed the view that the Japanese Government
                            had misinterpreted the import of our oral statement; that it was not
                            directed at inquiring into the attitudes of individuals or groups within
                            the Japanese Government; but that it raised the question, in view of the
                            fact that the purpose underlying the proposed understanding was based
                            upon a policy of peace, of the statements made by the Ambassador that he
                            was committed to such a policy, and of the evidence which this
                            Government had received that certain leaders desired to support Nazi
                            Germany in its movement of world conquest, whether the Japanese
                            Government as a whole intended to support a policy of peace such as
                            constituted the purpose of the proposed understanding. Mr. Hamilton
                            disclaimed any idea on our part of interfering in Japan’s internal
                            affairs, and commented that non-interference in the internal affairs of
                            other countries was a basic policy of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador maintained that, while it was true that the Japanese
                            Government was in an alliance with Germany and Italy and was bound to
                            remain faithful to it, the Japanese Government desired to pursue courses
                            of peace. He said that the Japanese Government had unquestionably
                            misinterpreted the import of our oral statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton asked whether the Ambassador had interpreted our oral
                            statement in the way his Government had. Mr. Hamilton also explained
                            that in referring to peace in the Pacific area we had in mind not only
                            peace between Japan and the United States but peace among all countries
                            in the Pacific area. He also adverted in this connection to what he had
                            said on July 5 to the Ambassador, at the direction of the Secretary, in
                            regard to our view that the Ambassador’s letter of July 4 to the
                            Secretary was too narrow in scope and that we thought it would be
                            helpful if a full and comprehensive reply could be made covering the
                            broad points set forth in the oral statement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that the intent of the oral statement in his
                            opinion was to seek clarification of the Japanese Government’s broad
                            intentions in regard to peace. The Ambassador explained that he had had
                            seventeen conferences with the Secretary as a result of which the
                            Ambassador had clearly in mind the Secretary’s aims on <pb n="508"
                                xml:id="pg_508" facs="0574"/>peace. Mr. Hamilton suggested that the
                            Ambassador might care to explain the situation to his Government with a
                            view to clearing away all misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that in the second place he had been directed to
                            inquire specifically as to any basis in fact for recurrent rumors and
                            press reports to the effect that Japan is planning to acquire naval and
                            air bases in French Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he was without information from his
                            Government in regard to its intentions on this point, but that he would
                            refer our inquiry to his Government. Judging from Japanese news reports
                            and from considerations of the general situation, involving the United
                            States, Great Britain, the Netherlands East Indies, China and the Soviet
                            Union, the Ambassador said he believed that Japan might have intentions
                            such as press reports indicated. He explained that Japan was concerned
                            over possible encirclement, and that the Japanese people had been
                            especially alarmed over reports of an alliance between China and Great
                            Britain. He referred also to increased aid by the United States to the
                            Chungking Government and to reported plans for strengthening the Burma
                            road. He affirmed that Japan was obliged to take appropriate
                            precautionary measures, and he referred to our military occupation of

                            that we might take Dakar and the Azores.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton observed that in our opinion no country was menacing Japan
                            and that it was difficult for us to reconcile the reports to which he
                            had referred with the professed desire of Japan to pursue courses of
                            peace. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine elaborated on this point at some
                            length.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the view that if the United States were in
                            Japan’s place we might be quicker to take action than Japan has been. He
                            said he personally failed to understand why so many Americans felt their
                            security threatened by Germany, as he felt that no country could be more
                            secure than we were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that the concern of the American people for their
                            security was based upon the judgment of our highest authorities, both
                            civil and military, and upon the actual record of Hitler’s movement of
                            conquest.</p>
                        <p>The conversation having turned to the friendly relations between the
                            United States and the other American Republics, the Ambassador expressed
                            his admiration for the way we managed our relations with our neighbors.
                            He voiced the hope that Japan might be able to conduct its relations
                            with its neighbors in a similar way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that, lastly, he had been directed by the Secretary to
                            inquire whether the Japanese Government regards itself as <pb n="509"
                                xml:id="pg_509" facs="0575"/>definitely obligated under the
                            Tripartite Treaty or otherwise to take any specific courses of action on
                            behalf of Germany or Italy, and whether the Japanese Government is under
                            any pledge, in case the United States should become involved in the
                            European war through acts of self-defense, to take any hostile action
                            against the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he believed that Japan retained freedom of
                            action under the Tripartite Pact and was under no commitment which would
                            call for Japan’s taking up arms against the United States in the event
                            of the involvement of the United States in the European war, except as
                            provided in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. He asserted that thus,
                            while the obligations of that article do not arise if the United States
                            should become involved in the European war through acts of self-defense,
                            Japan could not give a blank check for anything that we might call
                            self-defense but in case the provisions of Article 3 of the Pact should
                            be invoked Japan would have to reach its own judgment in the light of
                            the actual circumstances whether the provisions of that article were
                            applicable. He said that, of course, Japan hoped that the United States
                            would not enter the European war, but that nevertheless he felt sure
                            that there was nothing incompatible between Japan’s obligations under
                            the alliance and friendly relations with the United States. The
                            Ambassador expressed his belief that no useful purpose would be served
                            by referring this inquiry to his Government.</p>
                        <p>Although we questioned the Ambassador further on the subject of this
                            inquiry he did not go beyond his first answer. He repeated again and
                            again his view that in this critical world situation when things were
                            moving rapidly the conclusion of the proposed understanding between our
                            two Governments would tend to arrest the deterioration of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>As we were leaving, we expressed our appreciation of the Ambassador’s
                            giving us so much of his time. The Ambassador showed no irritation or
                            impatience with our inquiries, and the atmosphere throughout the
                            conversation was cordial and amicable.</p>

                        <p>In the communication handed to me by His Excellency the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs at the request of His Excellency the Prime Minister,
                            Prince Fumimaro Konoye, for delivery to the President of the <pb n="510"
                                xml:id="pg_510" facs="0576"/>United States dated July 7, 1941, the
                            request was made, “incidentally, the Japanese Government would like to
                            avail themselves of this opportunity for definitely ascertaining whether
                            it is really the intention of the President or the American Government
                            to intervene in the European war as they are naturally and very deeply
                            concerned at the prospect, disturbed as they sincerely are, by reports
                            reaching them from a variety of sources.”</p>
                        <p>In reply to the foregoing request of the Japanese Government, I am
                            instructed by my Government to state that the attitude of the United
                            States in the face of movement which the utterances and acts of the
                            leaders of Nazi Germany have made abundantly clear is directed toward
                            conquest of the world by force, is based on the inalienable right of
                            self-defense in pursuance of which the United States will of course and
                            of necessity take such measures of self-defense as may be deemed
                            necessary in order to resist this movement. Such measures of
                            self-defense and protection as may be adopted in conformity with this
                            policy will be determined by the acts of aggression which may be taken
                            or which are likely to be taken by the aggressor nations.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the policy of the United States is based upon the necessity
                            of protecting its own security in the face of the clearly revealed plan
                            of the aggressor nations for world conquest information as to what
                            future steps of aggression may be contemplated by those countries would
                            assist the Japanese Government in reaching an estimate as to what steps
                            of self-defense the Government of the United States may be forced to
                            take in order to safeguard its own security in the future. It should be
                            obvious that in the light of the experience of some fifteen countries in
                            Europe which were given categoric assurances by the leaders of Germany
                            that their security and territorial integrity would not be molested it
                            would be suicidal and absurd of the American Government to neglect any
                            reasonable precaution necessary to insure the present or future security
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It can hardly be expected therefore that the United States Government
                            will stand idly by and permit Germany to obtain control of the seas or
                            any other strategic advantages which would directly threaten the
                            security of the United States. Any intimations or suggestions that the
                            United States should desist from its policy of self-defense and
                            protection would in actual fact range those making such suggestions or
                            intimations on the side of those favoring or facilitating the aims of
                            the aggressor nations to conquer the world by force.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister, called at 4:15 this afternoon at his
                            request. He referred to the conversation which Mr. Ballantine and I had
                            had with the Japanese Ambassador yesterday evening at which time the
                            Ambassador had told us that the Oral Statement had been misunderstood by
                            the Japanese Government as indicative of an attempt on the part of the
                            American Government to cause a change in the Japanese cabinet and of
                            interference by the American Government in the internal affairs of
                            Japan. Mr. Wakasugi said that he understood what the Secretary of State
                            had in mind in the statements made in the Oral Statement but that in as
                            much as his Government had misunderstood the statement and in as much as
                            a governmental crisis had now occurred in Japan, the Ambassador had
                            asked Mr. Wakasugi to call and to leave with me the Oral Statement
                            handed to the Ambassador by the Secretary on June 21. Mr. Wakasugi said
                            that the Ambassador, in view of the circumstances, wished to dispose of
                            this matter in this simple, informal way and to continue with his
                            informal exploratory talks with the Secretary. Mr. Wakasugi then took
                            from his pocket a document which I assume was the original copy of the
                            Oral Statement of June 21.</p>
                        <p>I commented that in as much as the Secretary of State had handed the Oral
                            Statement in person to the Japanese Ambassador, I did not feel at
                            liberty to accept it from Mr. Wakasugi without first reporting the
                            matter to the Secretary and obtaining his instructions. I said that I
                            would of course be glad to refer the matter to the Secretary. I said
                            that last evening we had explained to the Japanese Ambassador the real
                            meaning and purpose of the Oral Statement; that we had been told that
                            some Japanese leaders earnestly desire to follow courses of peace; that
                            concurrently we saw manifestations in various quarters of attitudes of
                            other Japanese officials which we could not regard as representing a
                            desire on the part of those officials to follow courses of peace; that
                            in view of the fact that the fundamental purpose of the proposed
                            understanding between the Government of Japan and the Government of the
                            United States was to make manifest the desires of the two Governments to
                            follow courses of peace, we had raised the question whether the Japanese
                            Government as a whole wished to follow courses of peace and, if so,
                            whether the Japanese Government could not make manifest in some way its
                            desire to follow such courses. I said that I was positive that there had
                            been no thought whatsoever on the part of the Secretary of State or
                            anyone here that this Government <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0578"
                            />should interfere or was in the Oral Statement endeavoring to interfere
                            in the internal affairs of Japan. I called for a copy of the Secretary’s
                            statement of July 16, 1937 (copy attached).<note n="58"
                                xml:id="d284fn58">See <ref target="frus1931-41v01#pg_325">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 325</ref>.</note> I took a copy
                            of that statement and underlined the words “We advocate abstinence by
                            all nations … from interference in the internal affairs of other
                            nations”. I said that the principle represented in the quoted statement
                            was one of the fundamental principles followed by this Government and by
                            Mr. Hull. I said that this Government had made very clear in its
                            relations with the countries of this hemisphere as well as in its
                            relations with other countries the fact that it supported wholeheartedly
                            and with entire consistency the principle of noninterference in the
                            internal affairs of other nations. I gave Mr. Wakasugi the marked copy
                            of the July 16, 1937 statement and I told him that I felt warranted in
                            saying that the Ambassador could without any question whatsoever report
                            to his Government that this Government was definitely and fundamentally
                            committed to support of the principle of non-interference in the
                            internal affairs of other countries and that this Government would not
                            have included in the Oral Statement anything which would be inconsistent
                            with that fundamental principle.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that in as much as Mr. Wakasugi had said that the Ambassador
                            interpreted the Oral Statement in substantially the same way as we did
                            the simplest way of disposing of the matter would be for the Ambassador
                            to make report of his conception to his own Government. Mr. Wakasugi
                            said that the Ambassador had already done this. He asked whether he
                            might take with him the marked copy of the July 16, 1937 statement. I
                            replied emphatically in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. Wakasugi’s further request, I told Mr. Wakasugi that I
                            would report the matter to the Secretary and would expect thereafter to
                            get in touch with him. He said that the Ambassador might send the Oral
                            Statement to the Secretary under cover of a letter. I asked that the
                            Ambassador not do this until I had had an opportunity to report to the
                            Secretary and I told Mr. Wakasugi that after making such report I would
                            expect to get in touch with him.</p>
                        <p>Several times during the course of his call, Mr. Wakasugi indicated that
                            the matter was urgent.<note n="58a" xml:id="d284fn58a">The Konoye

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister, called this afternoon in further
                            reference to the desire of the Japanese Ambassador to return the Oral
                            Statement of June 21. I told Mr. Wakasugi that I was in position to make
                            a reply to him and that in an endeavor to avoid misunderstanding I had
                            written out the reply. I then read to him a statement (copy attached) as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the statement printed <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>After reading the statement, I went over it again with Mr. Wakasugi. I
                            called special attention to the last two sentences in which it was
                            stated that this Government is seeking and is hoping to find in the
                            attitude, utterances and acts of the Japanese Government as a whole that
                            the Japanese Government desires and is endeavoring to follow courses of
                            peace and rely upon methods of peace, and that <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0580"/>it is the broad general question of the
                            attitude of the Japanese Government as a whole, as manifested in

                            regarding which light is being sought.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that he fully understood the statements which I had
                            made to him. I told him that he was at liberty to make notes in regard
                            to those statements if he so desired but he did not feel that there was
                            need for this. He then gave me the original copy of the Oral Statement
                            of June 21 (attached)<note n="59" xml:id="d286fn59"><hi rend="italic"

                        <p>In view of the impression received from the Ambassador and Mr. Wakasugi
                            that the Oral Statement of June 21 has been misunderstood by the
                            Japanese Government and may therefore be a source of embarrassment, the
                            Secretary has authorized me to accept from you the Oral Statement which
                            he handed the Ambassador on June 21. In so doing we are mindful of the
                            fact that the document of June 21 is not in itself an official
                            communication but is simply a record of a statement made orally, of the
                            statements which we have made to the Japanese Ambassador and to you in
                            exposition of the real meaning and purport of the Oral Statement, and of
                            the Ambassador’s statement that he understands what the Secretary had in
                            mind in the Oral Statement. This Government is seeking and is hoping to
                            find in the attitude, utterances and acts of the Japanese Government as
                            a whole that the Japanese Government desires and is endeavoring to
                            follow courses of peace and rely upon methods of peace. It is the broad
                            general question of the attitude of the Japanese Government as a whole,
                            as manifested in utterances and acts, that necessarily concerns this
                            Government and regarding which light is being sought.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this evening at his request. The
                            Ambassador said that Japan now found herself isolated and that for that
                            reason the chief responsibility as to the future of Japan rested upon
                            the Japanese Navy. He said that if the Japanese Navy could have the
                            cooperation of the navy of the other great power of the Pacific, Japan
                            would not feel that her situation was really one of isolation. He said
                            that under the Tripartite Pact, so long as the Trans-Siberian railroad
                            remained open there was at least the possibility that Germany could give
                            assistance to Japan, but that now with the Trans-Siberian railroad
                            closed for a period no one could predict, Japan could get no assistance
                            in that way.</p>
                        <p>I inquired of the Ambassador whether it was not true that Japanese
                            foreign policy during the past year or so had been based upon the belief
                            that Germany and Russia would not be at war. The Ambassador said that
                            this of course was the fact and that he knew positively that Mr.
                            Matsuoka had had no knowledge that Germany was going to attack Russia
                            and had even at the last moment attempted to mediate between the two
                            powers. I expressed to the Ambassador my surprise that Japan, as a
                            member of the Tripartite Pact, should not have been given prior notice
                            by Germany of the latter’s intention to attack the Soviet Union,
                            particularly in view of the fact that only a short time before that
                            Japan had entered into a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. The
                            Ambassador replied that so far as he knew, no prior notification had
                            been given.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether this was not in fact the second time that Germany had
                            omitted to notify Japan of her intentions, since, if I remembered
                            correctly, in 1939 when Japan and Germany had been members of the
                            Anti-Communist Pact, Germany had suddenly entered into a far-reaching
                            non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union without prior notification to
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that of course this was true and that Baron Hiranuma,
                            then Prime Minister, had resigned because of this action on the part of
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>I said that it was exactly for this sort of reason that more than
                            ninety-nine percent of the people of the United States didn’t believe
                            that any pact that Hitler signed was worth the paper it was written on.
                            I said that this Government felt that it could only undertake
                            negotiations with a power which kept its obligations and whose word
                            could be regarded as sacred.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0582"/>
                        <p>I said, however, that the policy of this Government had been so fully set
                            forth to the Ambassador, and through him to the Japanese Government, by
                            the Secretary of State during recent months that I felt sure there was
                            nothing I could add.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thereupon immediately said that he felt more sanguine with
                            regard to the improvement of relations between our two countries in view
                            of the installation of the new government than he had felt previously.
                            He said he had immediately telegraphed his new Government, as soon as it
                            had been constituted, asking urgent instructions with regard to the
                            informal conversations he had been having with the Secretary of State.
                            He expressed the belief that he would soon receive full instructions
                            with regard thereto.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador left I said that in view of the new situation which he
                            told me had arisen by reason of the creation of the new Government in
                            Tokyo, I earnestly hoped that no new developments would take place in
                            the Pacific which would bring about any disturbance in the maintenance
                            of peace. The Ambassador said he also earnestly hoped so.</p>

                            <item>On July 20, 1941, about 3 P.M., Ambassador Nomura called on me at
                                my residence. After some general conversation, he informed me that
                                on Friday or Saturday<note n="61" xml:id="d289fn61">July 18–19,
                                    1941.</note> he had gone to Virginia Hot Springs [<hi
                                    rend="italic">White Sulphur Springs</hi>] to call on Mr. Hull,
                                but the latter’s physician had not permitted an interview.
                                Subsequently, as I understand, Ambassador Nomura had a conversation
                                with Mr. Welles. Prior to coming to my residence, he had called at
                                Admiral Stark’s house, but he had not found him in. He did not say
                                whether he had then tried to get in touch with Admiral
                                    Ingersoll;<note n="62" xml:id="d289fn62">Rear Admiral Royal E.

                            <item>Ambassador Nomura indicated that he desired to have a conversation
                                with Admiral Stark as soon as convenient; he intended to go to <pb

                                but will return shortly. I informed the Ambassador that I would
                                convey his request to Admiral Stark, and assured him that the latter
                                would be glad to talk with him.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Ambassador then explained at considerable length what he
                                proposed to discuss with Admiral Stark. He said that he is not a
                                professional diplomat, and is occupying his present position because
                                none of the trained diplomats in whom the government had confidence
                                had been willing to accept the Washington Mission; he had demurred
                                for a considerable period, and had accepted the duty only after
                                great insistence by his friends, particularly high ranking naval
                                officers and the more conservative groups of Army officers. He noted
                                that Admiral Toyoda, now Foreign Minister, had been more than
                                insistent that he accept the Mission; it was evident that he felt he
                                had a greater measure of Toyoda’s confidence than of Matsuoka’s. He
                                stated that he particularly wished to discuss the international
                                situation with Admiral Stark because, if the United States and Japan
                                could not remain at peace, it was obvious that a devastating naval
                                war would ensue.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Ambassador Nomura stated that for some weeks he had had frequent
                                conferences with Mr. Hull, in an endeavor to seek a formula through
                                which the United States and Japan could remain at peace. He no
                                longer hoped for 100% agreement on all points, but would be content
                                if a partial agreement could be reached which would prevent war
                                between the two countries. Such an agreement would necessarily be
                                informal, since Japan is now committed by treaty to Germany, and
                                this treaty could not be denounced at this time. However, he noted
                                that the decision as to when the military clauses of the treaty
                                would come into effect lies entirely in Japan’s hands, and that
                                these would be invoked only if Germany were to be the object of
                                aggression by another power. He stated that Japan entered the Axis
                                solely because it seemed to be to Japan’s interest to do so. Japan’s
                                future acts will be dominated solely by Japan, and not by any other
                                power. Whatever military action Japan takes will be for her own
                                ultimate purposes.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>He then talked at length on the points which Japan considered
                                essential for an agreement between the United States and Japan. The
                                fundamental basis of such an agreement necessarily would be that
                                either Power would be free to take such steps as seem to be required
                                by its own responsibility for self defense. He mentioned that, owing
                                to export restrictions against Japan by the United States and the
                                Philippines, and owing to a reduction in shipping tonnage available
                                for trade, Japan’s present economic position is bad and steadily
                                getting worse. It is essential that Japan have uninterrupted access
                                to necessary raw materials, particularly iron ore and iron <pb
                                    n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0584"/>products, oil, rubber,
                                cotton and food. There are other important items as well.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The second point is that the United States is constantly providing
                                greater support to China. If China is left without industrial and
                                military support, it will not be long before the Chungking regime
                                will be unable to continue the present “China Incident”; Japan will
                                then be able to withdraw from the greater part of China. However,
                                Ambassador Nomura noted that the United States is improving the
                                Burma Road, and is supplying airplanes and pilots to be sent to
                                Chungking. He understands that there are over a hundred American
                                pilots now en route, who have been supplied from the armed forces of
                                the United States. Japan must make some arrangement through which
                                support of this nature will be reduced, rather than increased. The
                                British are also contributing more and more to measures designed to
                                sustain the Chungking regime.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The third point which the Ambassador mentioned as essential for
                                Japan’s security is the more or less permanent stationing of
                                Japanese troops in Inner Mongolia in order to break the connection
                                between Russia and China, and in order to suppress the extensive
                                Chinese Communist elements in that general region. Japan has an
                                agreement with Wang Ching Wei which will permit Japanese forces to
                                remain in Inner Mongolia; how long such measures will continue
                                necessary can not be foretold. I inferred that, were this agreed to,
                                Japanese troops would be withdrawn from the greater part of
                                China.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>He then informed me that within the next few days Japan expects to
                                occupy French Indo-China. How the occupation would be made he is not
                                informed; presumably, it would be chiefly by an over-land march from
                                Hanoi southward, but on this he is not yet informed. In any case,
                                for the immediate future security of Japan, both against a possible
                                attack from the south and for a better control over the activities
                                of Chungking, this occupation has become essential.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>It was evident that Ambassador Nomura had some apprehension that
                                the United States would take further action against Japan, either
                                economically or militarily, as soon as Japanese troops were known to
                                be occupying French Indo-China. He anticipates an intensification of
                                the present press campaign against Japan in the United States. It
                                seems, though he did not so state categorically, that Japan
                                contemplates no further move to the south for the time being. He
                                made no mention of possible activity against Siberia.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>Ambassador Nomura indicated that these points were essential to
                                any informal agreements which might be made between the United
                                States and Japan. Rather cautiously he conveyed the impression that
                                were the United States to accept these conditions, any action it
                                might take in the Atlantic would not be a matter of great concern to
                                Japan. <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0585"/>The one great point
                                on which agreement might be reached, he again emphasized as the
                                inherent right of self defense.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>The Ambassador set forth all the foregoing without interruption on
                                my part. I informed him that I would present these points to Admiral
                                Stark’s attention. However, I desired to point out one important
                                thing to him, speaking solely from a personal viewpoint, and as one
                                naval officer to another, on a certain broad strategic aspect of the
                                situation which I envisaged. I agreed that there would be a
                                decidedly adverse reaction in the United States to Japanese
                                occupation of Indo-China. Entirely aside from matters of policy, it
                                would be evident to him that this move had an important bearing on
                                the strategic position of the United States.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>I pointed out that, speaking from the standpoint of self defense,
                                the greatest danger to the United States in the future lies in the
                                continued military success of Germany. The United States has been
                                able to live in peace because powerful military nations in Europe
                                have checked each other and prevented a military penetration by any
                                of them in the Western Hemisphere. If Great Britain were to
                                collapse, German military power might very well be directed against
                                South America, and such moves would cause great difficulties for the
                                United States. So long as the United Kingdom continues to exist as a
                                military and naval power, the problems of the United States as
                                regards its security will not be very great. Therefore, aside from
                                racial and social ideals, it is decidedly against the military
                                interests of the United States to permit the United Kingdom to be
                                overcome by Germany. For this reason any action which the United
                                States could take against Germany is necessarily one of self defense
                                and could never be considered as aggression. Furthermore, anything
                                that affects the future security of the United Kingdom, in any part
                                of the world, also is of interest to the United States from the
                                defensive viewpoint.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>The occupation of Indo-China by Japan is particularly important
                                for the defense of the United States since it might threaten the
                                British position in Singapore and the Dutch position in the
                                Netherlands East Indies. Were they to pass out of their present
                                control, a very severe blow would be struck at the integrity of the
                                defense of the British Isles, and these Isles might well then be
                                overcome by the Germans. It can thus be seen what a very close
                                interest, from a military viewpoint, the United States has in
                                sustaining the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in the southern
                                portion of the Far East.</item>

                            <item>I suggested that Japan really has very little to fear from
                                American, British or Dutch activities in the Far East. It might well
                                be, were these Powers to be displaced, Japan would find Germany
                                facing her in that region, which would put an entirely different

                                government, which at present include collaboration with the

                        <p>Owing to the absence of the Japanese Ambassador from Washington, the
                            Minister of the Embassy, Mr. Wakasugi, came in to see me this evening at
                            my request.</p>
                        <p>I expressed the hope to Mr. Wakasugi that the Ambassador’s absence from
                            Washington at this time was not due to illness. Mr. Wakasugi replied
                            that the Ambassador had left this morning by automobile to go to Maine
                            to stay with Admiral Pratt,<note n="63" xml:id="d290fn63">Admiral
                                William V. Pratt, U.S.N., retired, Chief of Naval Operations,
                                September 17, 1930–July 1, 1933.</note> expecting to return to
                            Washington on Saturday of this week.<note n="64" xml:id="d290fn64">July
                                26, 1941.</note> He had left word, however, that he would return to
                            Washington at a moment’s notice should he be needed here.</p>
                        <p>I said that I wished to preface my conversation by saying that what I was
                            about to say represented Secretary Hull’s views, as well as my own.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I was fully familiar, of course, with the details of the
                            informal conversations which Secretary Hull had been carrying on with
                            the Japanese Ambassador over a period of several months. I said that the
                            maintenance of peace in the Pacific, the abandonment of the utilization
                            of force or conquest in the national policies of the several governments
                            vitally interested in the Pacific and the consecration of the rights of
                            equality of opportunity and of equality of treatment to all of the
                            powers concerned constituted the very foundation of the possible
                            ultimate agreement between our two Governments which was the objective
                            of those conversations.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that in a recent conversation which I had had with the
                            Japanese Ambassador he had referred to Japan’s fear of encirclement and
                            I stated to Mr. Wakasugi, as I had to the Ambassador, that from the
                            reiterated expositions of United States policy which had been made to
                            the Japanese Ambassador by Secretary Hull in such detailed fashion upon
                            so many occasions, I felt sure that the Japanese <pb n="521"
                                xml:id="pg_521" facs="0587"/>Government could not have the remotest
                            belief that the United States Government had had in mind any such policy
                            towards Japan as would be represented by a policy of encirclement.</p>
                        <p>I stated that in view of all of these facts I had requested Mr. Wakasugi
                            to call in order to tell him quite frankly that from reports which had
                            reached me during the past few days from many different sources, I could
                            only assume that the Japanese Government had it in mind in the near
                            future to occupy Indochina. I said that the carrying out of a step of
                            this character would, in the opinion of this Government represent a
                            policy so utterly at variance with the foundation stones of the
                            agreement which had been under discussion as the objective of the
                            informal conversations which had taken place and so completely divergent
                            from the kind of policy which the Japanese Government would in fact
                            pursue if it were undertaking the course which had been clearly defined
                            in the informal conversations between the Ambassador and Secretary Hull,
                            that I felt it necessary frankly to ask what the real facts might
                            be.</p>
                        <p>I said that this Government fully appreciated the fact that the new
                            government so recently installed in Tokyo had public opinion in Japan to
                            reckon with and that, in view of the shaping of public opinion in Japan
                            which had been taking place during the past year, we could fully
                            understand that some time might be required before the new government
                            could undertake the carrying out of new policies of the nature which had
                            been under discussion in Washington. I said that if the Japanese
                            Government was sincerely desirous of reaching the kind of agreement
                            which had been under discussion and which required time because of the
                            state of public opinion to which I had referred, this Government was
                            willing to be most patient and understanding. I said, however, that
                            should the Japanese Government embark upon a policy of the kind which
                            would be demonstrated by the occupation of Indochina, the United States
                            and all other peace-loving nations interested in the Pacific must
                            necessarily be forced to reconsider their own individual positions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi looked me squarely in the eye and said that the Japanese
                            Embassy had no knowledge whatever of any intention on the part of the
                            Japanese Government of occupying Indochina or of taking any step which
                            would be at variance with the policies indicated in the informal
                            conversations which had taken place. He stated that he had assumed that
                            it was too early for Admiral Toyoda, the new Foreign Minister, to have
                            determined upon any questions of foreign policy, since, as the Minister
                            had publicly stated in the press, he must first engage in the task of
                            “learning diplomacy”.</p>
                        <p>I interjected by saying that Admiral Nomura had been good enough, in my
                            last conversation with him, to speak of the intimate friendship <pb
                                n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0588"/>and close relationship between
                            himself and Admiral Toyoda and had clearly indicated that the policies
                            of the Ambassador and of the new Foreign Minister would be
                            identical.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then said that he was quite sure this was the case since the
                            Ambassador had received immediately after the installation of the new
                            Foreign Minister a most affectionate message from him urging the
                            Ambassador to pursue with diligence the conversations with Secretary
                            Hull to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then inquired point-blank whether, in my judgment, the
                            occupation of Indochina by Japan would interfere with the successful
                            conclusion of the conversations which Secretary Hull had been carrying
                            on with Admiral Nomura. I replied that it seemed to me completely
                            illogical for one party to these conversations to be carrying on
                            discussions on a basis predicated upon the maintenance by the parties to
                            the conversations of a policy of peace, no resort to force or conquest,
                            et cetera, and at the same time for the other party to the conversations
                            to be undertaking in practice policies utterly and hopelessly at
                            variance therewith.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then said that he would immediately telephone the Ambassador
                            of our conversation and he believed that the Ambassador would wish to
                            return immediately to Washington to talk with me himself.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this afternoon at his
                            request.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Nomura commenced the conversation by saying that as soon as he
                            had received from Mr. Wakasugi the report of his conversation with me
                            two days ago, he had immediately returned to Washington in order to
                            speak with me personally.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then commenced his exposition, which I did not interrupt
                            until he had concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had now received from press reports, but not
                            as yet officially, information that the Japanese Government had
                            concluded with the Vichy Government an agreement whereunder the Japanese
                            Government would send military forces to occupy certain portions of
                            southern Indochina. The Ambassador said that he understood this
                            agreement entailed no violation of the inherent sovereignty of French
                            Indochina. He stated that I was well aware of the <pb n="523"
                                xml:id="pg_523" facs="0589"/>critical economic situation of Japan
                            and of the great difficulty which Japan had in procuring raw materials,
                            particularly food supplies, from abroad. He stressed the question of
                            lack of fertilizer which Japan had been accustomed to importing from
                            Germany and said that consequently additional rice must be imported from
                            abroad. He stated that Japan was now importing a million tons of rice a
                            year from Indochina. He went on to say that one of the two reasons for
                            the step taken was to assure to Japan an uninterrupted source of supply
                            of rice and other food stuffs, which Indochina afforded, as well as an
                            uninterrupted supply of other raw materials which they required from
                            that region. He stated that Japan believed that de Gaullist French
                            agents were stirring up trouble in southern Indochina and that of course
                            there were many Chinese agitators in that region and the Japanese
                            Government feared that at some time in the near future a situation might
                            develop which would cut off Japan’s supplies from these territories.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that the second reason for the occupation
                            undertaken was the need for military security. He stated that Japan
                            believed that certain foreign powers were bent upon a policy of
                            encirclement of Japan and that the step taken was purely a precautionary
                            measure in the nature of a safeguard.</p>
                        <p>The two situations which the Ambassador had set forth above, he stated,
                            had occasioned great “uneasiness” to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that from the tone of the press in this country
                            and from observations which had been made to him by various Americans in
                            whom he placed reliance, these recent developments were creating a
                            condition of great excitement and perturbation in the United States. He
                            said that of course the question of the measures which the United States
                            might take was something which the United States alone could determine,
                            but he urged most urgently that this Government should not “reach hasty
                            conclusions” and should permit a little time to elapse in the hope that
                            a friendly adjustment between Japan and the United States might be
                            found. He said that any measures restricting oil exports to Japan would
                            undoubtedly inflame Japanese public opinion exceedingly and he hoped, in
                            view of his own belief that friendly relations could be maintained
                            between the two countries, that full consideration might be given to his
                            views in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador concluded his exposition by saying that one of the first
                            messages he had received from the new Cabinet was an urgent instruction
                            to him to press for an understanding with the United States along the
                            lines he had been discussing with Secretary Hull. These instructions, he
                            said, were not as yet given to him in full detail but made it completely
                            clear that the new Government fully <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524"
                                facs="0590"/>supported the policies which he had been representing
                            throughout the course of the conversations.</p>
                        <p>He said that I would of course realize that “third powers” were doing
                            everything within their power to prevent the reaching of an agreement
                            with the United States. He expressed the hope that this Government would
                            bear this fact fully in mind in reaching any decisions it might
                            contemplate.</p>
                        <p>I replied to the Ambassador that in view of his statement to me that Mr.
                            Wakasugi had fully reported his conversation with me to the Ambassador,
                            I felt I need not cover the same ground again in my conversation with
                            the Ambassador this afternoon. I said that I had made it clear to Mr.
                            Wakasugi that if the Japanese Government was now determined to pursue a
                            policy diametrically opposed to the policy laid down by the Japanese
                            Ambassador in his conversation with Secretary Hull as the policy which
                            would result from the reaching of an agreement with the United States,
                            this Government must reconsider its own position in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I said it was very clear to this Government that any agreement which
                            Japan might have reached with the Vichy Government could only have been
                            reached as a result of pressure brought to bear upon the Vichy
                            Government by Berlin. Since that was the case in our judgment, the
                            reaching of this agreement by Japan could only be regarded as offering
                            assistance to Hitler in his obvious policy of world conquest and of
                            world domination, which, I emphasized, in the opinion of the United
                            States, would, if successful, prove equally deleterious to Japan and to
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador had referred to the desire of Japan, by occupying
                            Indochina, to assure itself of supplies of food and raw materials from
                            that territory. I said that if the agreement which Secretary Hull and
                            the Ambassador had been discussing were concluded, the Ambassador must
                            fully realize that a far greater measure of economic security would be
                            afforded Japan since the whole agreement was predicated upon equal
                            economic opportunity and equal economic security for all of the nations
                            directly concerned in the Pacific region. With regard to the statement
                            made by the Ambassador that the measure taken was in the nature of a
                            military precaution, I inquired as to what possible justification there
                            could be for such a step on the part of Japan when the Japanese
                            Government had been fully informed, through the Ambassador by Secretary
                            Hull, of the policy of this Government in the Pacific, which was a
                            policy of the maintenance of peace, of non-aggression and of the refusal
                            to carry out any policy of conquest or of physical force. I said the
                            policy of this Government was the reverse of a policy of encirclement or
                            of a policy which would constitute any threat to Japan. Furthermore, <pb
                                n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0591"/>I said, this Government was
                            equally confident that the policy of Great Britain constituted no menace
                            to Japan and that if an agreement of the kind which had been under
                            discussion were concluded, the United States would have been joined,
                            together with Japan, in support of the underlying principles for which
                            this Government stood, by the Governments of Great Britain, of the
                            Dominions, of the Netherlands, and, I was confident, by the Government
                            of China as well.</p>
                        <p>I said the Ambassador could hardly expect me to take seriously the
                            Ambassador’s statement that Japan was concerned by the activities of
                            Chinese agitators or de Gaullist sympathizers in southern Indochina. I
                            said I believed we could both agree to pass that by without further
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought the time had now come to speak with the complete
                            frankness which the Ambassador would expect from a member of his own
                            naval profession and I would consequently take the liberty of doing so.
                            I said that the movement now undertaken by Japan could only be regarded
                            by the United States as having two probable purposes, neither of which
                            purpose this Government could ignore.</p>
                        <p>First, the United States could only assume that the occupation of
                            Indochina by Japan constituted notice to the United States that the
                            Japanese Government intended to pursue a policy of force and of
                            conquest, and, second, that in the light of these acts on the part of
                            Japan, the United States, with regard to its own safety in the light of
                            its own preparations for self-defense, must assume that the Japanese
                            Government was taking the last step before proceeding upon a policy of
                            totalitarian expansion in the South Seas and of conquest in the South
                            Seas through the seizure of additional territories in that region.</p>
                        <p>This Government could not see that there was any fact or factual theory
                            upon which Japan could possibly fill Indochina with Japanese military
                            and other forces for purposes of defending Japan. The only consequent
                            alternative was to regard the occupation of Indochina by Japan as being
                            undertaken because of the Japanese realization of its value to Japan for
                            purposes of offense against the South Sea area.</p>
                        <p>I said that in view of all of these considerations, which I believed I
                            had set forth very clearly to the Ambassador, I was now in a position
                            where I must tell him, at the request of Secretary Hull, that the latter
                            could not see that there was any basis now offered for the pursuit of
                            the conversations in which he and the Ambassador had been engaged. This
                            Government, in the opinion of Secretary Hull, had made it thoroughly
                            clear to the Government of Japan that it was entirely ready to go
                            forward with Japan on the basis of peaceful <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526"
                                facs="0592"/>adjustment of the relations between the two countries
                            in accordance with the principles and policies set forth in the
                            agreement which it had been proposed should be concluded. This
                            Government had already shown the utmost measure of patience in its
                            dealings with Japan—and at this stage the Ambassador emphatically nodded
                            his head—and had been prepared, as I had emphasized to Mr. Wakasugi, to
                            continue to be patient in the event that the Government of Japan had
                            required time in order to deal with its own public opinion but had at
                            the same time refrained from embarking upon measures which were
                            fundamentally opposed to the principles which both parties here in
                            Washington had been endeavoring to establish. I repeated again that in
                            the judgment of the United States if such an agreement had been reached,
                            the Government of Japan would have obtained an infinitely greater amount
                            of security, both military and economic, than it could obtain through
                            its embarkation upon a policy of conquest by force.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he fully realized that this Government had
                            been exceedingly patient. He urged that it continue, at least for a
                            short time, to be patient and he said most emphatically that he was
                            willing to assure me that if the agreement which had been under
                            discussion had been concluded, the present steps would not have been
                            taken by the present Government of Japan. He said he felt that the
                            procrastination which had taken place—and for this he did not attempt to
                            place the blame—had been responsible for the creation of conditions with
                            which the new Government was confronted when it took office and from
                            which it could not immediately free itself.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador concluded by saying that he would report to Tokyo what I
                            had said.</p>
                        <p>I concluded the interview by saying that I was happy to say that
                            Secretary Hull was now almost completely restored to health and that he
                            hoped he would be able to return to Washington in the near future and in
                            such event I was sure that he himself would wish to talk again with the
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador gave me the impression of being greatly disturbed and
                            sincerely concerned by the possibility that a situation might now
                            develop which would make utterly impossible any understanding between
                            the two countries. His manner was exceedingly conciliatory throughout
                            the interview and when he spoke about his hope that the United States
                            would not reach “hasty conclusions”, he said three or four times that,
                            of course, he had no right to interfere or to give the impression that
                            he was intervening in the decisions which might be made by this country,
                            but that he made the remark solely because of his belief that a friendly
                            adjustment could still be found.</p>

                        <p>At the request of the Japanese Ambassador, the President received the
                            Ambassador for an off-the-record conference in the Oval Room at the
                            White House at five o’clock this afternoon. At the President’s request,
                            Admiral Stark and I were present.</p>
                        <p>At the outset of the conference the President made approximately the
                            following statement to the Ambassador. The President said, referring to
                            a talk which he had made this morning to a home defense group under the
                            leadership of Mayor LaGuardia,<note n="65" xml:id="d292fn65">For
                                President Roosevelt’s informal remarks, see Department of State, <hi

                                    rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, No. 109), p. 72.</note> that for more
                            than two years the United States had been permitting oil to be exported
                            from the United States to Japan. He said that this had been done because
                            of the realization on the part of the United States that if these oil
                            supplies had been shut off or restricted the Japanese Government and
                            people would have been furnished with an incentive or a pretext for
                            moving down upon the Netherlands East Indies in order to assure
                            themselves of a greater oil supply than that which, under present
                            conditions, they were able to obtain. The United States had been
                            pursuing this policy primarily for the purpose of doing its utmost to
                            play its full part in making the effort to preserve peace in the Pacific
                            region. At the present time, the President said, the Ambassador
                            undoubtedly knew that there was a very considerable shortage in the oil
                            supply in the eastern part of the United States and the average American
                            man and woman were unable to understand why, at a time when they
                            themselves were asked to curtail their use of gasoline oil, the United
                            States Government should be permitting oil supplies to continue to be
                            exported to Japan when Japan during these past two years had given every
                            indication of pursuing a policy of force and conquest in conjunction
                            with the policy of world conquest and domination which Hitler was
                            carrying on. The average American citizen could not understand why his
                            Government was permitting Japan to be furnished with oil in order that
                            such oil might be utilized by Japan in carrying on her purposes of
                            aggression. The President said that if Japan attempted to seize oil
                            supplies by force in the Netherlands East Indies, the Dutch would,
                            without the shadow of a doubt, resist, the British would immediately
                            come to their assistance, war would then result between Japan, the
                            British and the Dutch, and, in view of our own policy of assisting Great
                            Britain, an exceedingly serious situation would immediately result. It
                            was with all of these facts in mind, the President said, that
                            notwithstanding the bitter criticism that had been leveled against the
                                <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0594"/>Administration and against
                            the Department of State, the President up to now had permitted oil to be
                            shipped by Japan from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that this new move by Japan in
                            Indochina created an exceedingly serious problem for the United States.
                            He said that, as I had stated to the Ambassador yesterday, insofar as
                            assuring itself that it could obtain foodstuffs and raw materials from
                            Indochina, Japan, of course, had it reached an agreement with the United
                            States along the terms of the discussions between Secretary Hull and the
                            Ambassador, would have been afforded far greater assurances of obtaining
                            such supplies on equal terms with any other nation. More than that, the
                            President said, the cost of any military occupation is tremendous and
                            the occupation itself is not conducive to the production by civilians in
                            occupied countries of food supplies and raw materials of the character
                            required by Japan. Had Japan undertaken to obtain the supplies she
                            required from Indochina in a peaceful way, she not only would have
                            obtained larger quantities of such supplies, but would have obtained
                            them with complete security and without the draining expense of a
                            military occupation. Furthermore from the military standpoint, the
                            President said, surely the Japanese Government could not have in reality
                            the slightest belief that China, Great Britain, the Netherlands or the
                            United States had any territorial designs on Indochina nor were in the
                            slightest degree providing any real threats of aggression against Japan.
                            This Government, consequently, could only assume that the occupation of
                            Indochina was being undertaken by Japan for the purpose of further
                            offense and this created a situation which necessarily must give the
                            United States the most serious disquiet.<note n="65a" xml:id="d292fn65a"

                        <p>The President said that he had been following in complete detail the
                            conversations which had been progressing between Secretary Hull and the
                            Ambassador and that he was confident that the Ambassador would agree
                            that the policies now undertaken in Indochina by the Japanese Government
                            were completely opposed to the principles and the letter of the proposed
                            agreement which had been under discussion.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Ambassador took out of his pocket two sheets of notes
                            which he had prepared and asked the President’s permission to refer to
                            them in order to make a statement of his Government’s position.</p>
                        <p>In this exposition the Ambassador covered exactly the same ground which
                            he had covered in his conversation with me last night.</p>
                        <p>The only points of difference were that at the outset of the
                            conversation, the Ambassador very clearly and emphatically stated that
                            the move by Japan into Indochina was something which he personally
                            deplored and with which he personally was not in agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0595"/>
                        <p>After the Ambassador had made this exposition, the President said that he
                            had been glad to learn that the new Foreign Minister, Admiral Toyoda,
                            was an intimate friend of the Ambassador. The Ambassador replied that
                            that was the fact; that they both had grown up in the same surroundings
                            and that the relationship between them was very close.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he had a proposal to make to the Ambassador
                            which had occurred to him just before the Ambassador had come in and
                            which he had not had time to talk over with me before making his
                            proposal to the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it might be too late for him to make this
                            proposal but he felt that no matter how late the hour might be, he still
                            wished to seize every possible opportunity of preventing the creation of
                            a situation between Japan and the United States which could only give
                            rise to serious misunderstandings between the two peoples. The President
                            stated that if the Japanese Government would refrain from occupying
                            Indochina with its military and naval forces, or, had such steps
                            actually been commenced, if the Japanese Government would withdraw such
                            forces, the President could assure the Japanese Government that he would
                            do everything within his power to obtain from the Governments of China,
                            Great Britain, the Netherlands, and of course the United States itself a
                            binding and solemn declaration, provided Japan would undertake the same
                            commitment, to regard Indochina as a neutralized country in the same way
                            in which Switzerland had up to now been regarded by the powers as a
                            neutralized country. He stated that this would imply that none of the
                            powers concerned would undertake any military act of aggression against
                            Indochina and would refrain from the exercise of any military control
                            within or over Indochina. He would further endeavor to procure from
                            Great Britain and the other pertinent powers a guarantee that so long as
                            the present emergency continued, the local French authorities in
                            Indochina would remain in control of the territory and would not be
                            confronted with attempts to dislodge them on the part of de Gaullist or
                            Free French agents or forces.</p>
                        <p>If these steps were taken, the President said, Japan would be given
                            solemn and binding proof that no other power had any hostile designs
                            upon Indochina and that Japan would be afforded the fullest and freest
                            opportunity of assuring herself of the source of food supplies and other
                            raw materials in Indochina which she was seeking to secure.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then reiterated concisely and quite clearly what the
                            President had suggested. He then made some statement which was not quite
                            clear to the effect that such a step would be very difficult at this
                            time on account of the face-saving element involved on the part of Japan
                            and that only a very great statesman would reverse a policy at this
                            time.</p>
                        <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>The President then mentioned the fact that in the United States the
                            belief was apparent that such policies as those which Japan was now
                            pursuing were due to German pressure upon Japan. To this the Ambassador
                            reacted by saying that Japan was, of course, an independent country and
                            that while such pressure might be exercised, decisions on the policy she
                            was pursuing were solely her own and no one else had any responsibility
                            for them. The President then said that one thing the Japanese Government
                            did not understand as clearly as this Government was the fact that
                            Hitler was bent upon world domination and not merely the domination of
                            Europe or of Africa. The President said that if Germany succeeded in
                            defeating Russia and dominating Europe and then dominating Africa, there
                            wasn’t the slightest question in his mind that Germany thereafter would
                            turn her attention to the Far East and likewise to the Western
                            Hemisphere, and that while such a development might not take place for
                            many years, perhaps even ten years, the laws of chance made it easily
                            possible that in such contingency, the navies of Japan and of the United
                            States would be cooperating together against Hitler as the common enemy.
                            The President reemphasized his belief that what Hitler had in mind was
                            complete domination of the entire world.</p>
                        <p>To this the Ambassador replied that he would like to quote an old Chinese
                            proverb in which he had great faith, namely, “He who continuously
                            brandishes the sword eventually kills himself.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would immediately report his conversation to
                            his Government in Tokyo. He seemed to be very much impressed with what
                            the President had said but I did not gather from his reactions that he
                            was in any sense optimistic as to the result.</p>

                        <p>At the invitation of Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa, Mr. Ballantine
                            lunched with them at their apartment. Mr. Wikawa was late in arriving
                            and the greater part of the conversation that ensued took place before
                            Mr. Wikawa arrived. Colonel Iwakuro expressed regret that from the point
                            of view of relations between Japan and the United States the situation
                            has developed the way it has. He said that the question of Japanese
                            occupation of bases in Indochina had been before the Japanese Government
                            before he left for this country in February, and the underlying purpose
                            of the effort to reach an understanding <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                                facs="0597"/>was to set in motion a trend away from southward
                            advance and thus avert the possibility of such a step as had just now
                            been taken. He thought that if there had not been a delay in reaching
                            the understanding, which had raised in the minds of many Japanese
                            leaders a suspicion that this Government was not acting in good
                            faith—and Colonel Iwakuro hoped that I would understand that the
                            Ambassador and his associates here had no doubt whatever of our good
                            faith, the Japanese action in Indochina would not have occurred. He said
                            that the British Government had recently put an embargo on the export of
                            rice from Burma to Japan and that Japan has only French Indochina and
                            Thailand to rely upon for imports of this foodstuff. He declared that
                            his Government was apprehensive of the DeGaullist activities in south
                            Indochina and that there was real danger of Japan’s supply of rice being
                            cut off by disturbances created there.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro went on to say that the Embassy had again last night
                            received a third instruction from, his Government urging that an effort
                            be made to resume conversations with this Government looking to an
                            understanding. He said that while the resumption of conversations would
                            not have any effect in influencing the Japanese Government to revoke its
                            action in Indochina, the establishment of an understanding would be
                            effective in stopping Japan from moving further south, providing that
                            this Government did not take measures in the nature of embargoes or
                            freezing of assets against Japan. If such measures were invoked by the
                            United States<note n="65b" xml:id="d293fn65b">See press release issued
                                by the White House on July 25, 1941, <ref target="#pg_266">p.
                                    266</ref>.</note> he believed that Japan would have no
                            alternative but sooner or later to go south to Malaya and the Dutch East
                            Indies in order to obtain essential supplies. Colonel Iwakuro observed
                            that the Ambassador, being of a gentle disposition, would not have
                            expressed these views as positively as Iwakuro had. He suggested that,
                            while he did not wish to be understood as making any request, he would
                            be glad to talk himself with the Acting Secretary or the President if we
                            should so desire. He said he and Mr. Wikawa had already obtained passage
                            on the <hi rend="italic">Tatuta</hi> sailing from San Francisco on July
                            31, although there was a possibility that their sailing would be
                            deferred until the <hi rend="italic">Asama Maru</hi> sailed early next
                            month. He added, however, that they would be glad to stay longer if we
                            should desire to resume conversations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine said that our position on the matter of the Japanese
                            occupation of Indochina had already been made quite clear and that he
                            could not add anything to what the Acting Secretary had already told the
                            Japanese Ambassador in regard to the position of this Government.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro said that the Japanese Government had no intention
                            whatever to interfere with the internal affairs of French Indochina and
                            he could not understand why we regarded their action as any <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0598"/>different from our occupation of
                            Iceland, which, he said, was a puppet country following the German
                            occupation of Denmark.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine said that there was no point in his arguing over the facts
                            connected with the Japanese step in relation to Indochina, but he
                            desired to point out that Iceland was a fully independent country and
                            not a dependency of Denmark, although up to the time of the German
                            occupation the King of Denmark was also King of Iceland. Mr. Ballantine
                            said that according to his understanding the Icelandic Parliament had
                            full constitutional authority to enter into agreements with foreign
                            countries. Colonel Iwakuro suggested that we had been influenced by
                            propaganda of third powers interested in preventing the consummation of
                            an agreement between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine replied that this was not the case, but that, as stated in
                            the Secretary’s oral statement of June 21, we had accumulating evidence
                            that important elements in the Japanese Government desired Japan to
                            pursue a course supporting Hitler in his movement of world conquest and
                            that the only kind of an agreement with the United States which they
                            desired would allow Japan to pursue such a course.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro then went on to say that even though we could not
                            profitably pursue conversations at the present time an opportunity might
                            arise again in future, perhaps if Germany should vanquish Russia and
                            move over to the Far East. He thought that under such circumstances the
                            basis of our conversations might be different.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Iwakuro and Mr. Wikawa spoke warmly of our courtesies to them and
                            expressed the hope that the Secretary would have no doubts about their
                            sincerity and earnest desire to improve Japanese relations with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine obtained the impression that Colonel Iwakuro and Mr.
                            Wikawa had no real expectation that conversations would be resumed and
                            that their principal purpose was to fulfill their ideas of propriety.

                        <p>At the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I called on him again
                            today and we discussed at length the situation which had <pb n="533"

                            establishment by Japan of bases in southern Indochina and the reported
                            action of the American Government in freezing Japanese assets in the

                            immediately prior to this interview, I conveyed the substance thereof to
                            Admiral Toyoda so that he might know exactly what the Acting Secretary
                            had said to Admiral Nomura. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was
                            particularly anxious to ascertain the exact words of the Secretary’s
                            statement to the effect that he was unable to see that there was now any
                            basis for continuing the Washington conversations. The Minister
                            requested my interpretation of the Secretary’s statement. I told him in
                            reply that we could do no more than accept the statement at its face
                            value. The Minister gave obvious indications of being profoundly
                            concerned at the rupture of the Washington conversations, and as I have
                            ground for believing that immediately prior to our interview he had been
                            received by the Emperor I regard it as likely that he was reflecting the
                            concern of the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda told me that he particularly regretted the Acting
                            Secretary’s remark to the Japanese Ambassador regarding German pressure
                            on the French Government and told me that the Japanese negotiations with
                            the French Government in regard to Indochina had been carried on without
                            any pressure from any outside source.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda, as he had done with the British Ambassador, endeavored to
                            draw a comparison between Japanese action with respect to Indochina and
                            the measures undertaken by England in Syria, in reply to which I
                            emphasized the complete dissimilarity of the two cases.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda continually reiterated the view that the present
                            deplorable situation between the United States and Japan was due solely
                            to a misunderstanding on the part of the United States of Japan’s real
                            purposes, to which I replied that this entirely unfounded <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0600"/>allegation had been exploited <hi
                                rend="italic">ad nauseam</hi> for many years both by Japanese
                            officials and in the Japanese press, and I recapitulated to him a number
                            of bitter lessons which we had learned from experience as a result of
                            the assurances and promises of previous Japanese governments in regard
                            to the true aims of Japan. I made it clear to him why finally it had
                            become impossible for the Government and the people of the United States
                            to give credence to Japanese pledges and explanations of Japan’s “true
                            intentions”.</p>
                        <p>The Minister inquired with every indication of concern whether the United
                            States Government intended to adopt further retaliatory measures in
                            addition to the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States, to
                            which I replied that I had received no information in the premises.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda told me that he had hardly slept at all during recent
                            nights and he appeared greatly discouraged at the turn of events and
                            especially distressed that the present situation should have arisen at
                            the very time of his assumption of the post of Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs. I reviewed in detail my endeavors over many years, with
                            particular reference to my efforts with the Yonai Cabinet,<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d294fn71">Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, Japanese Prime Minister

                            relations on a sound and enduring basis and referred in this connection
                            to Admiral Nomura’s work in that direction in Washington recently.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, after stating that I was reluctant to end our talk in an
                            atmosphere of defeatism, I emphatically urged him to use his best
                            efforts with the view to preventing the further deterioration of
                            relations between the United States and Japan, which would inevitably
                            attend any future aggressive moves on the part of Japan in the Pacific
                            area.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the delay which is at present being encountered in the
                            delivery of telegrams, the Department’s no. 428, July 25, 9 p.m.,<note

                            on the morning of July 27. As it would appear that the element of time
                            is of first importance and the Foreign Minister was received by the
                            Emperor last evening, it would have been of great advantage to me to
                            have had the account of the President’s proposal to Admiral Nomura prior
                            to my interview with the <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0601"
                            />Foreign Minister yesterday. Nevertheless, with a view to neglecting
                            nothing which might bring about an acceptance of the President’s
                            proposal, I at once requested an appointment with the Foreign Minister
                            and called on him at 11.30 this morning.</p>
                        <p>I told Admiral Toyoda that I was not calling on him under instructions
                            from my Government but to have a private “off-the-record” conversation
                            on my own initiative in connection with a subject of such prime
                            importance that I felt that the circumstances warranted my requesting an
                            immediate appointment. I then conveyed orally to Admiral Toyoda the gist
                            of the President’s proposal to the Japanese Ambassador as outlined in
                            the Department’s telegram so that there could be no possibility of any
                            misunderstanding of the President’s remarks due to faulty or inadequate
                            reporting by the Japanese Ambassador to his Government. I left no
                            written statement with the Minister.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda to my amazement told me that he had received no report
                            from the Japanese Ambassador concerning the President’s suggestion and
                            having left the room for the obvious purpose of verifying this statement
                            with the Foreign Office he returned to confirm that no report on this
                            subject had been received from the Japanese Embassy at Washington. As I
                            read to him in paraphrase the various points of the President’s
                            proposal, the Minister examined them with close attention. He then
                            stated that he was afraid that the President’s suggestion had come too
                            late and that in any event, until Japanese public opinion which had been
                            greatly exercised against the United States as a result of the action of
                            the United States Government in freezing Japanese assets had had an
                            opportunity to cool, nothing could be accomplished along the lines of
                            the President’s proposal. He, however, agreed that before an answer
                            could be given to the President’s proposal it would have to be carefully
                            examined and discussed with other high officials of the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I was careful to point out to the Minister that I myself did not expect
                            an answer and that the reply of the Japanese Government would of course
                            be conveyed through the Japanese Ambassador in Washington following the
                            receipt of the latter’s report of his conversation with the President. I
                            took occasion at this point in the conversation to make it abundantly
                            clear to the Minister that the purpose of my call on him was not to
                            communicate to him the proposal of the President, which I assumed he had
                            already received, nor to request an answer but merely to urge upon him,
                            on my personal initiative, certain considerations in regard to this
                            proposal which appeared to me to be of the greatest importance. I
                            pointed out to the Minister that this proposal clearly and directly met
                            the <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0602"/>Japanese contention that
                            the occupation of bases in Indo-China was caused by the necessity of
                            protecting and of forestalling an alleged encirclement of Indo-China by
                            third countries and that, therefore, if the President’s proposal could
                            be accepted and put into effect it would adequately solve the problem
                            from the point of view of Japan. The Minister gave careful study to the
                            President’s reference to full and free access to food supplies and raw
                            materials and inquired whether this reference was also applicable to the
                            Dutch East Indies, to which I replied that for the moment the question
                            at issue was exclusively that of Indo-China but that as the Minister was
                            fully aware the conversations recently held in Washington had dealt with
                            the question of equal opportunity and free movement of trade throughout
                            the entire area of the Pacific. I then told the Minister that although I
                            had no authority whatsoever to touch on this question and was therefore
                            merely voicing certain personal observations, the acceptance of the
                            President’s proposal in regard to Indo-China might conceivably lead to
                            the establishment of a new basis for the continuance and successful
                            conclusion of these conversations.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Minister again reverted to the resentment which was
                            felt in Japan at the freezing of Japanese assets. I told him that I had
                            little knowledge of the intention of my Government in regard to the
                            administration of the Executive Order freezing Japanese assets but that
                            I believed, again speaking unofficially and personally, that there might
                            be considerable flexibility in the administration of the Order. I
                            reminded the Minister in this connection of the very liberal treatment
                            which had been granted to Japanese interests after the expiration of the
                            Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and told him that I personally
                            believed that if the Japanese Government would shape its actions and
                            policy in accordance with those principles which the American Government
                            desired to see in effect in the Pacific area, there would be no
                            reluctance on the part of my Government to facilitate any Japanese
                            efforts to that end.</p>
                        <p>I then urged the Minister with all the strength and earnestness at my
                            command to take advantage of the President’s statesmanlike and
                            far-seeing suggestion for obviating further and serious deterioration of
                            Japanese-American relations and indeed of the whole Far Eastern
                            situation. I told him that I fully recognized that the element of
                            “face-saving” must of necessity enter into the question, but that the
                            Minister was now presented with an opportunity to rise above such
                            considerations and to act in conformity with the highest statesmanship
                            and to take a decision which would not only permit him to be relieved of
                            the truly appalling situation with which he was confronted at the very
                            beginning of his office, but which might well result in his; being
                            regarded by history as one of the greatest statesmen of Japan. The <pb
                                n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0603"/>Minister, I believe, was deeply
                            impressed by my words and it is possible that this appeal may affect his
                            presentation of the President’s suggestion to the Emperor and to the
                            Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>I am fully aware that in seeking this interview with the Foreign
                            Minister, and in making this approach to him, I have been acting without
                            any authority from my Government but I was led to undertake this
                            approach on my own initiative and responsibility after careful
                            consideration of the following three factors: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The vital importance of making sure that the Japanese Foreign
                                    Minister should receive an accurate and complete report of the
                                    President’s proposal;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The time element, which is of equal importance, prevented my
                                    seeking prior authority; and</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The certainty of my belief that having made his farseeing and
                                    statesmanlike proposal to the Japanese Ambassador in Washington,
                                    the President would desire that nothing should be neglected to
                                    ensure that the far-reaching importance of this proposal should
                                    be fully understood by the Japanese Government and should be
                                    given the most careful and serious consideration. The acceptance
                                    or rejection of the President’s proposal may well determine the
                                    future peace in the Pacific.</item>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador came in to see me this afternoon at his request.
                            The Ambassador first of all said that he would greatly appreciate it if
                            I would tell him what the policy of this Government was, with regard to
                            the freezing order, in connection with Japanese vessels in American
                            territorial waters. He said that this question was giving his Government
                            great uneasiness and, in view of his sincere desire to avoid any further
                            difficulties between the two countries and to do what he could to
                            contribute to an easing of the present situation, he would appreciate
                            any information I could give him.</p>
                        <p>I replied to the Ambassador that for the time being and under present
                            conditions (and I repeated these phrases twice), the Treasury Department
                            would grant prompt clearance to any Japanese vessels in American ports
                            which desired to clear. The Ambassador seemed greatly relieved at this
                            reply and then asked what the attitude would be with regard to the
                            purchase by these vessels of food supplies which they needed for their
                            crews and of fuel supplies which they required in order to make it
                            possible for them to return to their own ports. I told the Ambassador
                            that all of these transactions would, of course, <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0604"/>require specific licenses from the
                            Treasury Department itself, but that for the time being and under
                            present conditions licenses would be granted for these transactions so
                            as to make it possible for these ships to clear from American ports when
                            they so desired. The Ambassador expressed great satisfaction at the
                            replies I had made to him.<note n="73" xml:id="d296fn73">For further
                                details on this subject, see <ref target="#pg_201">pp. 201</ref>
                                ff.</note></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then expressed his hope that by the exercise of the powers
                            of statesmanship, both in Japan and in the United States, the present
                            difficult situation would be passed without further deterioration in the
                            relations of our two countries. I reminded the Ambassador of the
                            extraordinary patience which the United States had demonstrated in its
                            relations with Japan during recent years and particularly during the
                            past six months. I said that time and again the Ambassador must have
                            been struck with that fact throughout the course of his talks with
                            Secretary Hull. I said that if any additional confirmation had been
                            required that confirmation had been afforded in the exceedingly
                            important proposal which the President had made to the Ambassador on
                            July 24. I stated that in view of the Ambassador’s statements, I felt it
                            due him to say in an extremely frank way that I had been greatly
                            surprised by receiving a report this morning from Ambassador Grew
                            relating his conversation with Foreign Minister Toyoda yesterday, July
                                27,<note n="74" xml:id="d296fn74">See memorandum of July 27, 1941,
                                    <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> in which Ambassador Grew
                            informed me that the President’s proposal had not yet, at that time,
                            reached Admiral Toyoda.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Nomura did not look particularly surprised. He said, however,
                            that he had immediately telegraphed a brief summary of the President’s
                            proposal; that he had then gone to New York and that yesterday, the
                            evening of July 27, he had telegraphed a very full and detailed account
                            of the President’s proposal to his Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then went on to say that he felt that what should now be
                            the objective, in view of the divergence of national policy between
                            Japan and the United States, was some compromise solution which would
                            prove acceptable to both sides. I said that I regretted that I must
                            differ from the Ambassador. I said that our policy, as the Ambassador
                            was well aware, was a policy of the maintenance of peace, of a
                            renunciation of force and conquest in the dealings between each other of
                            the nations of the Pacific area and of equal commercial and economic
                            opportunity for all of these nations on nondiscriminatory and equal
                            terms. I said that as the Secretary of State and as the President had
                            repeatedly made clear to the Ambassador, there was no desire on the part
                            of this Government to prevent Japan from receiving the assurances of an
                            economic and commercial character which she desired, provided the policy
                            which we had laid down was <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0605"
                            />pursued by all of the nations involved. Furthermore, I said, the
                            President’s proposal provided a complete ratification of what Secretary
                            Hull had so often said to the Ambassador, namely, that none of the other
                            powers mentioned—Great Britain, the Netherlands, the United States, the
                            British Dominions, and, we were sure, China—could conceivably be
                            regarded as having any aggressive designs upon Japan and that I believed
                            Secretary Hull had even gone so far as to say that were Japan to be
                            confronted by any real menace from Indochina, the United States fleet
                            would be sent in order to make it evident that this Government was
                            opposed to the operation of any such menace against Japan.</p>
                        <p>In view of all of these facts and of the policy which we had not only
                            preached but practiced, I did not see that there was the slightest
                            ground for any compromise solution of the kind the Ambassador had in
                            mind. I said it seemed to me we had come to the point where Japan had
                            now undertaken a policy completely different from that which had been
                            under discussion with this Government; the Ambassador now requested that
                            Japan continue her policy and we modify our policy. The compromise the
                            Ambassador suggested amounted merely to an abandonment by this
                            Government of the principles and policies for which we stood, which
                            Japan had been discussing with us, and which we believed alone could
                            afford Japan the economic safety and the national security she alleges
                            she is seeking.</p>
                        <p>Upon leaving the Ambassador asked whether the President would be able to
                            receive Colonel Iwakuro before the latter left on July 31. I told the
                            Ambassador that since the Ambassador himself made the request, I would
                            submit it to the President, but that I felt sure the Ambassador realized
                            the great number of demands which were now being made upon the
                            President’s time. The Ambassador was very emphatic in saying that he by
                            no means wished to intrude upon the President’s time.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called to see me this evening.</p>
                        <p>I stated to the Ambassador that the President desired me to inform the
                            Japanese Government through him that reports had now been received by
                            the Government of the United States which indicated that Japan was
                            making the same kind of economic and military demands upon the
                            Government of Thailand which it had recently made upon the French
                            Government with regard to Indochina. The <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540"
                                facs="0606"/>President desired me to say that, with regard to
                            Thailand, in the judgment of the Government of the United States there
                            was not the remotest threat of danger to Japan nor the slightest
                            justification for Japan alleging that she desired to obtain such
                            concessions from Thailand as a means of assuring a source of raw
                            supplies or as a measure of military precaution. The President therefore
                            desired the Japanese Government to know that the previous proposal which
                            he had made to Japan with regard to Indochina be regarded as embracing
                            Thailand as well, and that should the Government of Japan accede to the
                            proposal of the President and abandon its present course with regard to
                            Indochina, the President would request of the other powers which he had
                            mentioned in connection with his proposal concerning Indochina the same
                            guarantee and measure of security with regard to Thailand. The
                            Ambassador stated that he would at once transmit this proposal to his
                            Government.</p>

                            request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi commenced the conversation by stating that as I had been
                            informed by his Ambassador, he was leaving Washington tonight in order
                            to report by instruction of his Government. He stated that he would
                            report personally and directly to Prince Konoye, and likewise personally
                            and directly to the Foreign Minister, Mr. Toyoda. He stated
                            categorically that he represented the Prime Minister’s personal
                            establishment here in the United States; and that owing to his intimate
                            association with Admiral Toyoda from the time they were both stationed
                            in the Japanese Embassy, London in 1922 and 1923, he was in direct
                            communication with the Foreign Minister like wise. He said that what he
                            wished to ask me to be good enough to give him was my analysis of the
                            present state of relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>He said that he felt it was necessary for his Government without a
                            moment’s delay to realize what the policies of the Government of the
                            United States actually were and what the feeling of the people of the
                            United States actually was, since he felt that nothing was more needed
                            in Tokyo today than a clear vision on the part of the responsible
                            leaders of the Japanese Government of the two points he had asked me to
                            discuss with him.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0607"/>
                        <p>I said that I would be glad to respond to his request because I shared
                            his point of view in one regard, at least, completely. I said I was
                            sure, of course, that the Japanese Ambassador and he himself had been
                            reporting accurately and fully to their Government, but that I wondered
                            whether perhaps from other sources the Japanese Government might not
                            have obtained a partial and prejudiced or distorted point of view with
                            regard to public opinion in the United States and with regard to the
                            policy which this Government was intending to carry out in its relations
                            with the nations of the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>I said that perhaps Mr. Wakasugi was not aware of the fact that I had had
                            the privilege myself of living three years in Japan in the old days<note
                                n="74a" xml:id="d298fn74a">Mr. Welles was Secretary of Embassy in
                                Japan in 1915–17.</note> and that I had then had the opportunity of
                            knowing well at least some of the Japanese statesmen and intellectual
                            leaders of an earlier period, and that I had throughout the intervening
                            years always remembered with keen appreciation the personal benefits I
                            had derived from those friendships. I said that for this reason I had
                            always personally stood for the maintenance of very friendly relations
                            between our two countries, not only because of my own knowledge and
                            appreciation of Japan and the Japanese people, but also because of my
                            conviction that there was no real fundamental reason, in so far as the
                            best interests and desirable objectives of the two countries were
                            concerned, for the two nations ever to be involved in conflict. I said
                            that as I now looked back it seemed to me incredible that the relations
                            which existed in those happier days between Japan and the United States
                            could have degenerated into the relations which unfortunately existed
                            between our two countries today. I stated that I had felt warranted in
                            making this personal digression because I wished Mr. Wakasugi to
                            appreciate that what I had to say was being said in a friendly spirit
                            and because of my belief that at this late moment the truest evidence of
                            friendship on my part was complete and unmitigated frankness in
                            speech.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then said that he himself had been educated in this country
                            and had spent, off and on, the better part of 30 years in the United
                            States. He said that he felt very much about this country as I said I
                            felt about his own nation, and that he felt bound to say in response to
                            my frankness that in all of the 30 years of his experience, relations
                            between the two nations had never at any time approached the critical
                            point to which they had now unfortunately come.</p>
                        <p>I then resumed the conversation and said that Mr. Wakasugi had asked me
                            what the policies of this Government might be. I said that the policies
                            of my Government had been made clear time and again in our interchanges
                            with and in our communications to the Government of Japan since the
                            spring of 1933. I referred to letters exchanged between the Secretary of
                            State and the Foreign Minister, to <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542"
                                facs="0608"/>public statements made by the Secretary of State and by
                            the President and other officials, and by innumerable other clear-cut
                            and detailed analyses of our position with regard to the Pacific and
                            more specifically, vis-à-vis Japan. I said that in addition to all of
                            this, the policy of this Government had been made completely clear in
                            the most painstaking way by the Secretary of State himself in the
                            conversations which he had held during the past five months with the
                            Japanese Ambassador. Finally, I said, the policy of this Government was
                            clarified and summarized to the fullest extent possible by the proposal
                            which the President himself had made to the Japanese Ambassador on July
                            24 and to which this Government had not as yet received any reply.</p>
                        <p>I said that I doubted whether in the history of the past 50 years any
                            great power in its dealings with another great power had consistently
                            shown such utter and complete patience as had the Government of the
                            United States in its dealings with Japan.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. Wakasugi nodded his head.</p>
                        <p>I said that if Mr. Wakasugi nevertheless desired me once more to
                            summarize the policy of this Government, I should define it succinctly
                            as a policy which contained, as its fundamental premise, the maintenance
                            of peace in the Pacific; the renunciation by all of the powers
                            interested in the Pacific of force and of conquest as their national
                            policy; the recognition of the rights of independent and autonomous
                            peoples of the Pacific to independence and integrity; and equal
                            opportunity and fair treatment for all, and exclusive preference or
                            privilege for none. I added that it seemed to me that the policy of the
                            United States made it fully clear to the Government of Japan that the
                            American Government and people desired in no way to impede or to limit
                            the equal rights of the Japanese people to economic and commercial
                            opportunity, either in the Pacific or, for that matter, throughout the
                            world, or the enjoyment of equal opportunity in obtaining free access to
                            raw materials and food supplies required in the national economy of
                            Japan; and afforded Japan complete assurance that so long as Japan
                            adopted similar policies the United States could never remotely be
                            regarded as endangering by military or naval force the national security
                            of the Japanese Empire.</p>
                        <p>I said that I wished to emphasize by repeating the fact that American
                            policy, if Japan followed an identical course, afforded Japan the
                            fullest measure of security both physical and material. However, I said,
                            at the same time that this policy had been enunciated over and over
                            again to Japan, Japan had been following more and more openly a
                            completely diametrical tendency.</p>
                        <p>The result was that during these recent years our national policies,
                            instead of converging, had been moving steadily apart and the result <pb
                                n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0609"/>was that today this Government
                            was forced to the conclusion that the policy finally and definitely
                            adopted by Japan was a policy of expansion through the use of force and
                            by conquest. I said that I wished, therefore, to make it very clear to
                            Mr. Wakasugi that in my considered judgment, if Japan continued on an
                            aggressive policy of force and undertook moves of expansion which would
                            result in acts of aggression upon additional peoples in the Far East, in
                            the south or in other regions of the Pacific, the aim of Japan could
                            only be regarded by the United States as the creation of a military
                            overlordship of the Japanese Empire imposed over all of the peoples of
                            the Far East, the Southern Pacific, and perhaps over other areas as
                            well. If this were in reality the objective of the Japanese Government,
                            I thought it necessary at this stage to say that in my judgment such a
                            situation as that would inevitably be regarded as intolerable by the
                            United States and by other peace-minded nations having direct interests
                            in the Pacific, and that, consequently, whether it came tomorrow, or
                            next month, or next year, or even later, the pursuit of such an
                            objective by Japan would inevitably result in armed hostilities in the
                            Pacific.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. Wakasugi interjected to say that what I had stated
                            confirmed his own fears that the situation would now reach an
                            exceedingly critical stage. He said that there were certain underlying
                            factors which the Japanese people could never explain to themselves. He
                            said that when Japan first awoke in the middle of the last century from
                            her long sleep of isolation, she found herself completely surrounded by
                            the imperialistic encroachments which occidental nations had made, not
                            only in China, but in all the Pacific region as well. He said that the
                            United States had been a rapidly expanding and growing country but that
                            Japan was likewise a rapidly expanding country, obviously not on the
                            same scale as the United States, but nevertheless on the same general
                            trend. He said that the Japanese people could not indefinitely be
                            confined to their own poor land and that they had to find, in view of
                            their ever increasing birth rate and their rapidly rising power as a
                            great nation in the world, some means of expanding outside of their own
                            territories. At the very moment that the Japanese people were beginning
                            to realize their situation along these lines, he said, the other great
                            powers of the world had been undertaking exactly the same kind of
                            action, by acquiring colonies and dominating other less advanced
                            peoples, which we, the United States, were now reproaching the Japanese
                            people for undertaking.</p>
                        <p>I said it would be ludicrous for me to attempt to argue with regard to
                            the policies and measures undertaken by the great powers of the world
                            ill the last century but that I was certain that in the years when I had
                            first known Japan, Japan and the United States both <pb n="544"
                                xml:id="pg_544" facs="0610"/>agreed that a new and better era in the
                            world was possible and that while, unfortunately enough, a better era
                            had not been realized, I saw no reason for a retrogression in
                            international policy which Mr. Wakasugi seemed to be recommending as a
                            justification for the policy of conquest upon which his country now
                            seemed to be embarked. I said that if it came to a question of
                            expansion, I could quite understand the need for an energetic, able, and
                            rapidly growing race like the Japanese to undertake in their own
                            national interest certain forms of expansion outside of their own
                            national boundaries, but I said that in the considered judgment of this
                            Government the people of Japan would be infinitely more benefited and
                            rendered infinitely more secure by the kind of expansion for which this
                            Government stood than by the policy of expansion for which the present
                            Government of Japan stood. I said that the kind of expansion which I had
                            in mind was the kind of peaceful and productive expansion which resulted
                            in the expansion of Japanese commercial activities in other countries
                            along the lines of equality and non-discrimination which had been for so
                            many years now upheld by the United States. I said I could conceive of
                            no way in which greater prosperity, and contentment and security could
                            come to the Japanese people than by utilizing their great gifts for
                            commercial enterprise and thereby enjoy the great markets which China
                            and other nations of the Far East as well as other nations in other
                            sections of the world offered for peaceful commercial enterprise of this
                            character. I asked him to compare the situation of Japan today, bled as
                            she had been by the militaristic efforts she had been making in one form
                            or another since 1931, with the position which Japan would occupy today
                            if she had embarked upon the other course which I had indicated. I said
                            surely there was great accuracy in what the Japanese Ambassador himself
                            had stated a few days ago when he said that by the occupation of China,
                            Japan had been putting everything into China and getting nothing out. I
                            said that almost inevitably that was the sole result which Japan could
                            gain from her present militaristic course and that the eventual outcome
                            would be, I felt, economic prostration, and possibly social and
                            financial collapse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi did not appear to differ from the opinions I expressed but
                            merely stated that he feared it would be very difficult for the Japanese
                            people to comprehend the truths involved in my statements to him.</p>
                        <p>He then suddenly said “The main task of statesmanship on both sides today
                            is for us to avoid being drawn into conflict. How far can Japan now
                            expand without running the risk of war with the United States?”</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>I replied in as clear a statement as possible that it was quite
                            impossible for me to answer this question categorically and precisely. I
                            said that it was not, in my judgment a question of exactly where the
                            line would be drawn by this country because, for that matter, the
                            implementation already undertaken by Japan of her expansionist policy of
                            conquest might, in my judgment, create a situation where the vital
                            interests of this country might be directly affected. I said the problem
                            was not what this country would agree to in the way of occupation by
                            Japan of other independent countries, but the fact that Japan was bent
                            upon a policy of conquest which, if pursued and persisted in, would, in
                            my opinion, inevitably result in a situation where the vital interests
                            of the United States and of other great powers directly interested in
                            the Pacific would be directly involved. I stated that he was mistaken if
                            he thought that this Government would say to the Japanese Government
                            “You can occupy this, that, or the other country, but you can go no
                            further.” I said that the issue was the fact that Japan appeared to be
                            bent upon pursuing a policy which would result in the creation of a
                            military overlordship by Japan of the Pacific area and that it was the
                            policy itself which, in my judgment, prejudiced the security of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then changed the subject and said that he had been unable to
                            understand at all from his Ambassador the proposal which the President
                            had made. He asked if I would clarify the matter for him. I therefore
                            repeated to him clearly and precisely exactly what the President’s
                            proposal had been as covered in the memorandum of my conversation
                            between the President and the Ambassador of July 24, and Mr. Wakasugi
                            then said that he now understood for the first time clearly exactly what
                            the President had in mind. He added of his own volition that he could
                            not deny that what the President proposed, if consummated, would give
                            security to his own country and to the other nations interested in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then said that he had one final question to ask me and that
                            was what the opinion of this Government might be concerning the solution
                            of postwar problems.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had read with a great deal of interest the address which
                            I had made which touched upon that subject<note n="75" xml:id="d298fn75"
                                >For remarks by the Acting Secretary of State on July 22, 1941, at

                                75.</note> and that since he himself had attended so many meetings
                            of the League of Nations he wanted to express his own belief that a new
                            league of nations, set up on the foundations utilized by the old League
                            of Nations would not prove practical nor successful. He said he did not
                            now want to argue about what nation or nations had been responsible for
                                <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0612"/>the failure of the old
                            League of Nations, but he thought the time had certainly come to
                            consider what better world order might be set up when peace again was
                            restored.</p>
                        <p>He said as he envisaged it, the most practical solution was the creation
                            of regional federations, one to consist of Europe and Africa, one of the
                            Western Hemisphere, one of the Far East, and one of Russia.</p>
                        <p>I said that I had heard a similar point of view expressed by many others,
                            but that I wondered if one took this approach as a solution for the
                            problem how one could possibly anticipate that such matters as
                            disarmament or equality of economic enjoyment could be solved by the
                            creation of regional federations. I said, to be perfectly specific and
                            conceive of a Far Eastern federation and a Western Hemisphere
                            federation, how could the regional federation of the new world ever be
                            satisfied that a real limitation of armament could be undertaken unless
                            it was confident that the Fur Eastern federation was in actual practice
                            limiting its armaments of all categories to exactly the same lines as
                            those undertaken by the Western Hemisphere federation? In exactly the
                            same way, I said, unless one undertook a universal approach, how could
                            the economic difficulties from which the world had been so long
                            suffering be solved through regional federation control. I said,
                            however, that as he knew, I had never at any time been willing to
                            express any opinion with regard to the precise mechanism that might be
                            employed by the powers of the world when the appropriate opportunity was
                            presented, but that I thought it was in fact highly desirable for all
                            peace-minded nations to be considering these matters and exchanging
                            views between themselves with regard thereto. I said I wanted to make it
                            very clear, however, that of one thing I was completely confident and
                            that was that no “new orders”, were they Hitler-inspired or
                            Japanese-inspired, would tend to solve this problem, but rather quite
                            the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then left, expressing his appreciation for the opportunity
                            he had had of talking with me and expressing the hope that he might be
                            back in Washington before many weeks had passed.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called upon the Secretary at the Secretary’s
                            apartment by appointment made at the Ambassador’s request.<note n="76"
                                xml:id="d299fn76">Mr. Okumura was also present.</note></p>
                        <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>In the course of a brief interchange of general remarks the Secretary
                            observed that both he and the Ambassador were deserving of sympathy
                            because of the developments which had led to a breakdown in their
                            arduous efforts to bring about a better understanding between the United
                            States and Japan. The Ambassador nodded assent and then came to the
                            business at hand. He said that he had promptly referred to his
                            Government the proposal which had been made to him by the President on
                            July 24, but explained that as it took the Japanese Government a longer
                            time than it did this Government to reach decisions on important matters
                            it had not been until the previous evening that he had received
                            instructions from his Government in reply thereto. He then drew out a
                            paper which he proceeded to read. Subsequently he gave a copy of this
                            paper to Mr. Ballantine. A copy is attached.<note n="77"
                                xml:id="d299fn77"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> After reading
                            the paper, in which reference was made to a proposal by the Japanese
                            Government, he handed the Secretary a document marked “Strictly
                            Confidential. Proposal by the Japanese Government”.<note n="78"
                                xml:id="d299fn78"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_549"
                                    >p. 549</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador seemed disposed to discuss the contents of the
                            proposal, but the Secretary suggested that he thought that time would be
                            saved all around if we postponed any discussion of it pending study of
                            the document. The Secretary then proceeded to put the proposal in his
                            pocket without reading it. The Secretary then said that he was frankly
                            pessimistic over the prospect of getting anywhere with a proposal such
                            as that referred to in the oral statement which the Japanese Ambassador
                            had made. He dwelt on the arduous efforts which the Ambassador and he
                            had made covering a period of months to try to bring about better
                            relations between Japan and the United States and to lay the foundation
                            of peace in the Pacific. He said that while these conversations had been
                            going on we had been receiving continually reports of the agitation in
                            the press of Japan, which was Government-controlled, in favor of a
                            policy of force and of conquest. We had also received reports of
                            statements by Japanese leaders advocating a course the very opposite of
                            that which underlay the spirit of the conversations between the
                            Ambassador and the Secretary. The Secretary also referred to the fact
                            that the Government-controlled Japanese press was now talking about
                            encirclement of Japan by the United States and Japanese leaders were
                            voicing similar views. The Secretary remarked that the Germans, while
                            waging their campaign in Russia hundreds of miles from their own
                            territories, were speaking of acting in self-defense against aggression.
                            Similar apologies were being made in connection with their military
                            activities in other parts of Europe outside of their borders. The
                            Secretary said that he did not <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0614"
                            />see how we could usefully pursue any conversations or discuss
                            proposals premised on the contention that the United States was
                            endeavoring to encircle Japan. The Secretary observed that while on the
                            one hand he and the Japanese Ambassador had been making sincere efforts
                            to reach an understanding based upon the idea of peace throughout the
                            Pacific area, on the other hand the Secretary was being charged in Japan
                            with machinations to encircle Japan. In view of these circumstances the
                            Secretary reiterated that he felt very discouraged indeed and felt
                            doubtful that there was any prospect of being able to deal at this time
                            with any proposalof the Japanese Government relating to the
                            establishment of peaceful relations in the Pacific such as the Japanese
                            Government appeared to have in mind. The Ambassador offered no
                            particular comment and the matter was left that the Secretary would
                            examine the proposal.</p>

                        <p>The purport and nature of the measures taken by the Japanese Government
                            in effecting a joint defense of French Indo-China has already been
                            explained by the Japanese Foreign Minister to the United States
                            Ambassador in Tokio as well as by myself to the President and the Acting
                            Secretary of State. To summarise, the measures are of entirely peaceful
                            character and for self-defense, and an intervention by any third Power
                            would be wholly unwarranted. They were absolutely necessary in order to
                            prevent from getting beyond control the Japanese public opinion which
                            had been dangerously aroused because of the successive measures taken by
                            the United States, Great Britain and Netherlands East Indies against
                            Japan, and consequently in order to preserve peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>As the United States Government has nevertheless manifested certain
                            anxiety over the situation in regard to French Indo-China, the Japanese
                            Government, with a view to dispelling any such misgiving, has instructed
                            me to transmit a proposal and to enter into negotiations in strict
                            confidence and on an “off record” basis. The proposal is intended to
                            serve as a reply in a way to the suggestion made by the President on
                            July 24 during his conversation with me, and to provide a fresh basis
                            for Japanese-American understanding on which informal conversations have
                            been carried on during the past months. I have to add that any accord of
                            views which may result from the present negotiations is to be
                            incorporated in the general formula for the adjustment of the relations
                            between our two countries.</p>

                        <p>At all events, the Japanese Government is convinced that it is more than
                            ever necessary to examine calmly and with a spirit of understanding
                            toward the standpoint of each other the diverse causes which have been
                            responsible for the strained relations between Japan and the United
                            States, and to endeavor for the removal and alleviation of such causes
                            and conditions as will upset the military, political and economic
                            equilibrium that should normally exist between the two countries. The
                            Japanese Government believes that its views in this respect are fully
                            shared by the Government of the United States.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s request.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary handed the Japanese Ambassador a document marked strictly
                            confidential and dated August 8, 1941<note n="80" xml:id="d302fn80"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> in reply to the proposal of the
                            Japanese Government contained in the document handed by the Japanese
                            Ambassador to the Secretary on August 6. The Secretary suggested that
                            the Ambassador might care to glance over the document.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador read the document and stated that he understood
                            its import. He said that the Japanese Government was very desirous of
                            adjusting relations with the United States and was anxious to find means
                            of doing so. He asked whether it might not be possible for the
                            responsible heads of the two Governments to meet, say in Honolulu, as
                            was suggested in the original Japanese proposal presented to us, with a
                            view to discussing means whereby an adjustment could be brought
                            about.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if an understanding of the nature which the
                            Secretary and the Ambassador had been discussing for these last <pb
                                n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0617"/>several months had been reached
                            the two countries by now would have been able to go forward along a
                            course of peace and of mutual benefit. The Secretary went on to say that
                            this Government had been prepared to be patient and to move gradually
                            and to be of all possible help it could to the Japanese Government in
                            order to enable the Japanese Government to assert control over all
                            groups in Japan so that the Japanese Government as a whole and public
                            opinion could be brought into line to support policies such as those
                            which the Ambassador and the Secretary had in mind. The Secretary
                            pointed out that while this Government was proceeding along this patient
                            course the Secretary had, at a time when he was recuperating from
                            illness in the country, received word of measures taken by the Japanese
                            Government which made it clear that those elements in the Japanese
                            Government which favored peaceful courses had lost control and that
                            accordingly he had directed officers of the Department to inform the
                            Japanese Ambassador that, in the opinion of this Government, the
                            measures now taken by the Japanese Government had served to remove the
                            basis for an understanding such as the Ambassador and he had had in
                            mind. Thus, the Secretary said, the understanding which the Secretary
                            and the Ambassador had hoped to reach and which he felt that they had
                            nearly reached failed of realization.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that the Japanese press was being constantly
                            stimulated to speak of encirclement of Japan by the United States. He
                            said that today he had told press correspondents that there is no
                            occasion for any nation in the world that is law-abiding and peaceful to
                            become encircled by anybody except itself. The Secretary said that while
                            in Japan the press was being officially inspired in ways calculated to
                            inflame public opinion this Government was not treating Japan in any
                            such way but was doing all that it could to deprecate agitation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he thought that the efforts being made to
                            inspire the press in Japan were motivated purely by a desire to
                            invigorate the Japanese people and were not inconsistent with a sincere
                            desire on the part of the Japanese Government to improve relations with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>He asked whether what the Secretary had said could be taken as the
                            Secretary’s reply to the suggestion he had made for a meeting of the
                            responsible heads of the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went over once more the points which he had previously
                            brought out and suggested that, in the light of what he had said and of
                            the reply which he had handed the Ambassador, it remained with the
                            Japanese Government to decide whether it could find means of shaping its
                            policies accordingly and then endeavor to evolve some satisfactory
                            plan.</p>

                        <p>The President’s proposal was that, if the Japanese Government would

                            military and naval forces, or, in case such steps had already actually

                            British Government and the Netherland Government, and the Government of
                            the United States would of course itself give, a binding and solemn
                            declaration, provided the Japanese Government would make the same
                            commitment to regard French Indochina as a “neutralized” country in the
                            same way in which Switzerland had up to now been regarded by the powers
                            as a neutralized country; that such a binding and solemn declaration on
                            the part of each of the Governments mentioned would imply that none of
                            these Governments would undertake any military act of aggression against
                            French Indochina and that each of those Governments would refrain from
                            the exercise of any military control within or over French Indochina.
                            The President’s proposal contemplated further that the Government of the
                            United States would endeavor to obtain from Great Britain and the other
                            interested powers a guarantee that, so long as the present emergency
                            continues, the local French authorities in Indochina would remain
                            undisturbed in control of the territory of French Indochina.
                            Subsequently, the President’s proposal with regard to French Indochina
                            was extended to include Thailand as well, and the Japanese Government
                            was informed that, should the Japanese Government accept the proposal of
                            the President and abandon its present course with regard to French
                            Indochina, the President would request of the other Governments which he
                            had mentioned in connection with his proposal concerning French
                            Indochina the same declaration and guarantee with regard to
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States feels that its views in regard to a
                            broad understanding which would be calculated to establish and maintain
                            peace in the Pacific area to the benefit of each and every country
                            concerned in that area have been made abundantly clear in various
                            official utterances and acts and in the course of the long series of
                            conversations which the Secretary of State has had during recent months
                            with the Japanese Ambassador. It feels that the Japanese Government is
                            well aware of its attitude, of what it is able and willing to do, and of
                            what it cannot do. It therefore feels that the proposals advanced in the
                            document handed to the Secretary by <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553"
                                facs="0619"/>the Japanese Ambassador on August 6 are lacking in
                            responsiveness to the suggestion made by the President, the

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at his request. He proceeded to say that
                            he had again read over the documents that he and I had had under
                            discussion, that he had been in communication with his Government, and
                            that he believed there were grounds for progress in the conversations.
                            He said that his Government was very desirous of working out peaceful
                            relations between our two countries and he elaborated further along this
                            line and against the idea of war. He stated that he would favor
                            concessions in order to avoid war and that from what he heard from his
                            Government, it would make concessions in order to avoid war. He said
                            that in fact it would be glad to have a high Japanese official meet a
                            high American official half way between the two countries in order to
                            take up the matter in its final form.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then pointedly inquired of me whether conversations such
                            as he and I had been conducting could be resumed between our two
                            Governments. I proceeded to reiterate and repeat the circumstances
                            leading up to the cessation of our conversations and the reasons which I
                            set forth through Mr. Welles for their discontinuance. I did not pass
                            further on the question which he propounded but left it as it was. The
                            Ambassador remarked that the situation was critical and it was very
                            important in his judgment for suitable steps to be taken to avoid
                            serious developments but I still revealed no sign whatever of saying
                            anything favorable about his request for a resumption of conversations.
                            I said that as the matter stands Japan with her Army, Navy and air
                            forces was establishing many bases in and about French Indochina under
                            her continued policy of conquest by force, that this would mean about
                            the last step prior to a serious invasion of the South Sea area if it
                            should be decided upon by Japan, that such an invasion would be a
                            serious menace to British success in Europe and hence to the safety of
                            the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, and that,
                            therefore, this Government could not for a moment remain silent in the
                            face of such a threat, especially if it should be carried forward to any
                            further extent. The Ambassador remarked that the people of Japan did not
                            have enough foodstuffs and went to Indochina to secure such needed
                            commodities <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0620"/>as rice. To this I
                            promptly replied that if Japan had been willing to go forward with a
                            peaceful settlement of the Pacific area in line with the principles and
                            policies the Ambassador and I had discussed, Japan would have been able
                            peacefully and without the use or threat of force to have equal access
                            with every other nation to world markets for rice and all other
                            foodstuffs.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador repeatedly said that his country was very desirous of
                            peaceful relations with this country in the future as well as now and
                            that he believed his Government would make some concessions in order to
                            resume conversations to this end. I expressed interest in this and again
                            referred to Japan’s continuing policy of conquest by force and of bitter
                            denunciation of this country by the Government controlled press which is
                            loudly supporting such a policy, and again I said that I would not be in
                            a position to say anything relative to his request in addition to what I
                            had said some days ago when he first brought up the matter.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to the Ambassador that the situation was very serious and
                            that if he desired to talk to any others on this subject or to the
                            President it would be perfectly agreeable with me and I would not
                            consider it as in any way going around me, et cetera. The Ambassador
                            said that he would not be in a position to talk to the President until
                            he first telegraphed his country for instructions as to what concessions
                            it might be willing to make in connection with a resumption of
                            conversations.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called to see the President at the latter’s
                            request. Following some few exchanges of preliminary remarks, the
                            President then became serious and proceeded to refer to the strained
                            relations between our two countries. He referred to the Ambassador’s
                            visit to me and the latter’s request for a reopening of the
                            conversations between our two Governments. The President commented
                            briefly on the policies and principles that this Government has been
                            standing for in its relations with Japan, and he made some contrast to
                            Japan’s opposite course of conquest by force, et cetera. He concluded by
                            saying that our attitude of opposition to Japan’s course has been made
                            well known, and that the next move is now up to Japan. The President
                            inquired of the Ambassador if he had anything in mind to say in
                            connection with the situation. Thereupon the Ambassador <pb n="555"
                                xml:id="pg_555" facs="0621"/>drew out of his pocket an instruction
                            which he said was from his Government, in which the Japanese Government
                            set forth some generalities and asserted very earnestly that it desired
                            to see peaceful relations preserved between our two countries; that
                            Prince Konoye feels so seriously and so earnestly about preserving such
                            relations that he would be disposed to meet the President midway,
                            geographically speaking, between our two countries and sit down together
                            and talk the matter out in a peaceful spirit.</p>
                        <p>The President thereupon said that this Government should really bring the
                            matters between the two Governments literally up to date and that he
                            would, therefore, offer certain observations about the position of this
                            Government; he added that he regretted the necessity of so doing but
                            that he had no other recourse. The President said he had dictated what
                            he was about to say and that he would read it to the Ambassador and then
                            hand him the Written instrument containing the oral conversation. This
                            the President proceeded to do as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the oral statement printed <hi rend="italic"
                                >infra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>The President, after some little delay in the conversation so as to set
                            apart the first statement which he read to the Ambassador, then
                            proceeded to turn to the Ambassador’s request to the Secretary of State
                            and to himself for a resumption of the conversations. The President made
                            further references to Japan’s opposing course of conquest by force and
                            bitter denunciation of this country by the Japanese
                            Government-controlled press and then coming to the request for a
                            reopening of the conversations he repeated our former statements to the
                            Japanese Government that, of course, we could not think of reopening the
                            conversations if the Japanese Government is to continue its present
                            movement of force and conquest supported by its bitter press campaign
                            against this country.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon the President proceeded to read to the Ambassador the following
                            statement, which is self-explanatory:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the statement printed on <ref target="#pg_557">page
                                557</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador received each paper in writing and said he would
                            communicate both to his Government. He reiterated from time to time that
                            his Government was very desirous of preserving peaceful relations
                            between the two countries and he took no issue with the President
                            relative to the reasons set forth by this Government for discontinuing
                            conversations with Japan.</p>

                        <p>During past months the Governments of the United States and of Japan,
                            through the Secretary of State and the Japanese Ambassador in
                            Washington, have engaged in protracted conversations directed toward
                            exploring the possibility of reaching a sound basis for negotiations
                            between the two countries relative to the maintenance of peace with
                            order and justice in the Pacific. The principles and policies which were
                            under discussion in these conversations precluded pursuit by either
                            Government of objectives of expansion by force or by threat of
                            force.</p>
                        <p>On July 24 last the President of the United States informed the Japanese
                            Government through the Japanese Ambassador in Washington that he was
                            willing to suggest to the Governments of Great Britain, of The
                            Netherlands and of China that they make a binding and solemn declaration
                            that they had no aggressive intentions with regard to Indochina and that
                            they would agree that the markets and raw materials of Indochina should
                            be available to all Powers on equal terms. The President stated further
                            that he would be willing to suggest to the Powers mentioned that they
                            undertake this declaration, in which the United States would be willing
                            to join, upon the understanding that the Government of Japan would be
                            disposed to make a similar declaration and would be further disposed to
                            withdraw its military and naval forces from Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding these efforts, the Government of Japan has continued its
                            military activities and its disposals of armed forces at various points
                            in the Far East and has occupied Indochina with its military, air and
                            naval forces.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is in full sympathy with the desire
                            expressed by the Japanese Government that there be provided a fresh
                            basis for amicable and mutually profitable relations between our two
                            countries. This Government’s patience in seeking an acceptable basis for
                            such an understanding has been demonstrated time and again during recent
                            years and especially during recent months. This Government feels at the
                            present stage that nothing short of the most complete candor on its
                            part, in the light of evidence and indications which come to it from
                            many sources, will at this moment tend to further the objectives
                            sought.</p>
                        <p>Such being the case, this Government now finds it necessary to say to the
                            Government of Japan that if the Japanese Government takes any further
                            steps in pursuance of a policy or program of military domination by
                            force or threat of force of neighboring countries, the Government of the
                            United States will be compelled to take immediately <pb n="557"
                                xml:id="pg_557" facs="0623"/>any and all steps which it may deem
                            necessary toward safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the
                            United States and American nationals and toward insuring the safety and
                            security of the United States.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the question which the Japanese Ambassador raised on
                            August 8 during a conversation with the Secretary of State whether it
                            might not be possible for the responsible heads of the Japanese
                            Government and the Government of the United States to meet with a view
                            to discussing means whereby an adjustment in relations between the
                            United States and Japan might be brought about. The thought of Prince
                            Konoe and of the Japanese Government in offering this suggestion is
                            appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Reference is made also to the desire expressed by the Japanese Ambassador
                            during a call on the Secretary of State on August 16 that there be
                            resumed the informal conversations which had been in progress between
                            the two Governments toward ascertaining whether there existed a basis
                            for negotiations relative to a peaceful settlement covering the entire
                            Pacific situation.</p>
                        <p>When the Japanese Ambassador brought up these suggestions, the Secretary
                            of State reminded the Ambassador that the Government of the United
                            States had shown great patience and had been prepared to continue in
                            that course of patience so long as the Japanese Government manifested a
                            desire to follow courses of peace. It was pointed out to the Ambassador
                            that while proceeding along this course this Government had received
                            reports indicating clearly that the Japanese Government was adopting
                            courses directly the opposite of those on which the recent conversations
                            between the Ambassador and the Secretary of State had been predicated.
                            It was pointed out also that the Japanese press was being constantly
                            stimulated to speak of encirclement of Japan by the United States and
                            was being officially inspired in ways calculated to inflame public
                            opinion. The Secretary of State made it clear that he did not see how
                            conversations between the two Governments could usefully be pursued or
                            proposals be discussed while Japanese official spokesmen and the
                            Japanese press contended that the United States was endeavoring to
                            encircle Japan and carried on a campaign against the United States.</p>
                        <p>On two occasions officers of the Department of State, pursuant to
                            instructions from the Secretary of State, called on the Japanese
                            Ambassador to indicate concern over the reports that Japan intended to
                                <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0624"/>acquire by force or threat
                            of force military and naval bases in French Indochina. Subsequently, on
                            July 21 and July 23 the Acting Secretary of State raised with the
                            Japanese Minister and with the Japanese Ambassador the question of
                            Japan’s intentions with regard to French Indochina and pointed out that
                            the Government of the United States could only assume that the
                            occupation by Japan of French Indochina or the acquisition of military
                            and naval bases in that area constituted notice to the United States
                            that Japan had taken by forceful means a step preparatory to embarking
                            on further movements of conquest in the South Pacific area. The Acting
                            Secretary pointed out further that this new move on Japan’s part was
                            prejudicial to the procurement by the United States of essential raw
                            materials and to the peace of the Pacific, including the Philippine
                            Islands.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States accordingly had no alternative but to
                            inform the Japanese Ambassador that, in the opinion of this Government,
                            the measures then being taken by the Japanese Government had served to
                            remove the basis for further conversations relative to a peaceful
                            settlement in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>Informal discussions between the Japanese Government and the Government
                            of the United States directed toward ascertaining whether there existed
                            a basis for negotiations relative to a peaceful settlement covering the
                            entire Pacific situation would naturally envisage the working out of a
                            progressive program attainable by peaceful methods. It goes without
                            saying that no proposals or suggestions affecting the rights and
                            privileges of either the United States or Japan would be considered
                            except as they might be in conformity with the basic principles to which
                            the United States has long been committed. The program envisaged in such
                            informal discussions would involve the application in the entire Pacific
                            area of the principle of equality of commercial opportunity and
                            treatment. It would thus make possible access by all countries to raw
                            materials and to all other essential commodities. Such a program would
                            envisage cooperation by all nations of the Pacific on a voluntary and
                            peaceful basis toward utilizing all available resources of capital,
                            technical skill, and progressive economic leadership for the purpose of
                            building up not only their own economies but also the economies of
                            regions where productive capacity can be improved. The result would be
                            to increase the purchasing power of the nations and peoples concerned,
                            to raise standards of living, and to create conditions conducive to the
                            maintenance of peace. If such a program based upon peaceable and
                            constructive principles were to be adopted for the Pacific and if
                            thereafter any of the countries or areas within the Pacific were
                            menaced, the policy of aiding nations resisting aggression would
                            continue to be followed by this Government and this Government would
                            cooperate with other nations in extending assistance to any country
                            threatened.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0625"/>
                        <p>Under such a program for the Pacific area Japan would, in the opinion of
                            the Government of the United States, attain all the objectives which
                            Japan affirms that it is seeking. This program would not enable any
                            country to extend its military or political control over other peoples
                            or to obtain economic rights of a definitely monopolistic or
                            preferential character. In those cases where the production and
                            distribution of essential commodities are vested in monopolies, the
                            Government of the United States would expect to use its influence to see
                            that all countries are given a fair share of the distribution of the
                            products of such monopolies and at a fair price.</p>
                        <p>If the Japanese Government is seeking what it affirms to be its
                            objectives, the Government of the United States feels that the program
                            above outlined is one that can be counted upon to assure Japan
                            satisfaction of its economic needs and legitimate aspirations with much
                            greater certainty than could any other program.</p>
                        <p>In case the Japanese Government feels that Japan desires and is in
                            position to suspend its expansionist activities, to readjust its
                            position, and to embark upon a peaceful program for the Pacific along
                            the lines of the program and principles to which the United States is
                            committed, the Government of the United States would be prepared to
                            consider resumption of the informal exploratory discussions which were
                            interrupted in July and would be glad to endeavor to arrange a suitable
                            time and place to exchange views. The Government of the United States,
                            however, feels that, in view of the circumstances attending the
                            interruption of the informal conversations between the two Governments,
                            it would be helpful to both Governments, before undertaking a resumption
                            of such conversations or proceeding with plans for a meeting, if the
                            Japanese Government would be so good as to furnish a clearer statement
                            than has yet been furnished as to its present attitude and plans, just
                            as this Government has repeatedly outlined to the Japanese Government
                            its attitude and plans.</p>

                        <p>As requested by Mr. Terasaki,<note n="80a" xml:id="d308fn80a">Director of
                                the American Bureau of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> I called on him at the Foreign Office at three
                            o’clock this afternoon. Mr. Terasaki said that he would appreciate my
                            conveying to the Ambassador a private message from him, as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The interview between the Foreign Minister and the Ambassador, to
                                    be held at four o’clock this afternoon would be of the greatest
                                    importance. He hoped that it would initiate a series of
                                    conversations <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0626"/>between
                                    them which would eventually yield a satisfactory adjustment of
                                    American-Japanese relations. If these conversations should prove
                                    unsuccessful, he did not believe that another attempt could be
                                    made. If a Cabinet under the leadership of Prince Konoye should
                                    prove unable to adjust relations with the United States, it
                                    would be inconceivable for any other Japanese statesman to
                                    succeed where he had failed.</p>
                                <p>The prime requisite in accomplishing the end which he had in mind
                                    was high statesmanship on both sides—an undue alertness on the
                                    part of either side to criticize the actions and policies of the
                                    other should be avoided and each should make effort to
                                    appreciate the position of the other.</p>
                                <p>The third point stressed by Mr. Terasaki was that whereas Japan
                                    was ready to respond to any action by the United States intended
                                    to bring the conflict in the Far East to an end, it will under
                                    no circumstances give in to any form of pressure.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki concluded by requesting that I inform the Ambassador that
                            high hopes were being held in all influential quarters with regard to
                            the outcome of the conversations which would be initiated by today’s
                            interview between the Ambassador and the Foreign Minister. He hoped that
                            the Ambassador would do everything possible to bring these hopes to full
                            fruition.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: Mr. Terasaki explained that the
                                conversations would be “off the record”, by which he meant that

                                question which might arise during the conversations.</p>

                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to call at 4 o’clock this
                            afternoon and in an oral statement which took two hours and a half to be
                            delivered, interpreted from Japanese into English and transcribed by me,
                            Admiral Toyoda set forth a proposal of prime importance for solving the
                            present critical situation between Japan and the United States. He
                            pointed out the supreme importance of avoiding any leakage, especially
                            he said to the Germans or Italians, and he hoped that in my report to
                            Washington no risk would be incurred of my telegram being read by
                            others. I said that the telegram would be sent in a code which I hoped
                            and believed was unbreakable. I said that so far as I was concerned the
                            only persons who would be informed of the proposal would be Mr. Dooman
                            and my confidential secretary, Miss Arnold, who would transcribe the
                            conversation. The Minister seemed to be entirely satisfied with these
                            assurances.</p>

                        <p>The Minister commenced by stating that this was to be a long and strictly
                            confidential talk on a very important matter in which he asked for my
                            cooperation. He said that he would speak to me frankly as a naval
                            officer and not as a career diplomat. I replied that I myself had no use
                            for Old World diplomacy and was accustomed to speaking also with the
                            utmost frankness and straight from the shoulder.</p>

                            <item>The stationing of Japanese forces in Indochina, resulting from the
                                protocol for the joint defence of Indochina, was a peaceful and
                                protective step taken for the purpose of solving the China affair.
                                It was an independent step taken on Japan’s own initiative and no
                                German or any other pressure had been exerted.</item>

                                Admiral Nomura, the United States had assumed that this was the
                                exercise of armed force at the instigation of Germany and had taken
                                an economic step which had brought our countries very near to a
                                complete severance of economic relations and had left a big black
                                spot on the long history of peaceful relations between the United
                                States and Japan.</item>

                                public opinion has become extremely excited but the Government has
                                done all in its power to repress this excitement by prohibiting
                                posters, public gatherings and hostile press comment.</item>

                            <item>The reply of the Japanese Government to the President’s proposal
                                of July 24, was sent immediately to Washington and when Secretary
                                Hull returned to Washington on August 6 Ambassador Nomura had handed
                                him the reply. This reply had been drafted after careful and
                                complete study and with a view to meeting as far as possible the
                                intentions of the American Government.</item>

                            <item>The Japanese reply contains important proposals which would bind
                                both governments; Japanese forces in Indochina would be immediately
                                withdrawn when the China affair is settled; it contains three points
                                binding each party.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless the President’s proposal was an independent one
                                dealing exclusively with the joint defence measure of Indochina. The
                                Japanese reply was also accordingly restricted to that subject and
                                was to be dealt with independently of the general adjustment of
                                relations which had been discussed between Secretary Hull and
                                Admiral Nomura.</item>

                            <item>On August 8 Admiral Nomura had received from Secretary Hull the
                                American reply to the Japanese proposal reiterating the substance of
                                the President’s proposal of July 24 and Admiral Toyoda regretted
                                that the American reply seemed to attach too little importance to
                                the profound consideration given by the Japanese Government to the
                                President’s proposal.</item>

                            <item>In other words, the American proposal, it seems, suggested the
                                withdrawal of Japanese forces from Indochina as a prerequisite
                                although the Japanese Government had definitely affirmed its
                                intention to withdraw immediately after the China affair had been
                                settled because the China affair is the obstacle to peace in the Far
                                East.</item>

                                Japanese Government hopes that it will give full consideration to
                                the Japanese Government’s declaration and will cooperate for the
                                settlement of the China affair which is the obstacle to peace in the
                                Far East.</item>

                            <item>As the Ambassador is fully aware, both the present and the last
                                cabinet of Prince Konoye have had the sincerest wish to adjust
                                relations with the United States and it is the Minister’s firm
                                conviction that there is no room for doubt that this wish has been
                                equally shared by President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull.</item>

                            <item>Admiral Toyoda says this because the breakdown of peace between
                                both countries which has long been cherished with the accomplishment
                                of cordial friendship between both peoples would itself be an
                                extremely miserable matter, and not only that but because both Japan
                                and the United States which are the last two countries which hold
                                the key for maintaining world peace in their hands under the present
                                world situation would proceed to the worst situation without showing
                                statesmanship; that would leave the greatest black spot on human
                                history and would be nothing but making future historians unable to
                                understand the nature of the breakdown, and lastly because allowing
                                the situation to come to that pass would mean that we as statesmen
                                had not fully fulfilled our responsibility for the benefit of both
                                peoples.</item>

                            <item>The Minister believes that both Japan and the United States must
                                do their duty as saviours of the world in the present crisis, and
                                for that purpose the problems lying between the two countries must
                                be considered in a calm and friendly atmosphere on an equal basis as
                                between two great powers facing the Pacific Ocean; the Minister
                                further believes that it would be possible to come to an adjustment
                                of relations between both countries in that spirit.</item>

                            <item>The Minister cannot but recognize the fact that in spite of the
                                points just mentioned the present relations between the United
                                States and Japan have become extremely strained as a result of
                                misunderstanding between the two countries and sinister designs by
                                third-powers, and that if the situation should be left without
                                trying to prevent it from getting worse it would lead to a most
                                critical situation.</item>

                                discover the methods for contributing toward mankind and the peace

                            <item>In other words, the Minister thinks that it would be most
                                opportune if the leaders of both countries, animated by the above
                                mentioned desires, could have talks most frankly in order to dispose
                                of American-Japanese relations in the aforesaid spirit and also from
                                a broadminded point of view, and in view of his conviction that it
                                would be highly desirable that Prince Konoye should proceed to
                                Honolulu and have talks personally with President Roosevelt if the
                                President would consent to this suggestion, the Minister sent an
                                instruction on August 7 to Ambassador Nomura about this matter. He
                                intended that Admiral Nomura should personally see President
                                Roosevelt on his return to Washington.</item>

                                relations from the broadminded point of view as a result of the

                                this connection the Minister wishes to call my attention to the fact
                                that it is absolutely necessary to avoid arousing misunderstanding

                                both inside and outside this country that the Japanese Government
                                has entered into negotiation with the American Government as a
                                result of American pressure. Based upon this point of view the
                                Minister deems it desirable that various measures of economic
                                pressure against Japan be immediately stopped or highly moderated
                                and the Japanese Government is of course ready to reciprocate at
                                once in this respect. The Minister wishes to draw the attention of
                                the American Government to this point.</item>
                            <label>20.</label>
                            <item>The foregoing is the substance of the highly serious and
                                absolutely secret proposal for which the Minister especially asked
                                me to visit him today. In view of its importance and delicate nature
                                he does not need to ask me to keep this only to myself as it is not
                                difficult to imagine what would occur if it should leak out. This is
                                the reason why he has so far been instructing only Admiral Nomura to
                                discuss and to dispose of the matter in the United States, but in
                                order to make this proposal realized he has most frankly expressed
                                his opinion to me so that he may have my helpful cooperation and, if
                                there should be any question concerning this proposal he will be
                                very glad to talk it over with me.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In the early part of the Minister’s oral statement, before he had come to
                            the proposed meeting in Honolulu, I spoke of Japan’s progressive
                            southward advance and the fact that in spite of all peaceful assurances
                            the American Government, in the light of the steps taken by Japan, could
                            only be guided by facts and actions and not by words. I noted also the
                            fact that whereas in previous conversation the Minister had ascribed the
                            Japanese move into Indochina as brought about by the threatened
                            encirclement by other powers including the United States and Great
                            Britain he now ascribed it exclusively to the settling of the China
                            affair. To these comments the Minister made no reply.</p>
                        <p>I furthermore repeated to him the statement which the Under Secretary had
                            made to the Japanese Ambassador on July 23 to the effect that Mr. Hull
                            could not see that any basis was now offered for continuing the
                            conversations which had been carried on in Washington between the
                            Secretary and Admiral Nomura and I also spoke of Mr. Hull’s statement to
                            Admiral Nomura on August 8 to the effect that in the view of the
                            American Government the proposal handed by the Japanese Ambassador to
                            the Secretary of State on August 6 failed in responsiveness to the
                            proposal advanced by the President on July 24.</p>
                        <p>At the end of his presentation I said that I would withhold comment until
                            my Government had had an opportunity to study the proposal which the
                            Minister had advanced but I said that in the interests of peace I would
                            give the proposal my own personal support.</p>

                        <p>1268. The Ambassador reports as follows for Secretary Hull and Under
                            Secretary Welles:</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>He says that naturally he is not aware of the reaction President
                            Roosevelt will have to the proposal made today orally by the Japanese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Ambassador urges, however, with all
                            the force at his command, for the sake of avoiding the obviously growing
                            possibility of an utterly futile war between Japan and the United
                            States, that this Japanese proposal not be turned aside without very
                            prayerful consideration. Not only is the proposal unprecedented in
                            Japanese history, but it is an indication that Japanese intransigence is
                            not crystallized completely owing to the fact that the proposal has the
                            approval of the Emperor and the highest authorities in the land. The
                            good which may flow from a meeting between Prince Konoye and President
                            Roosevelt is incalculable. The opportunity is here presented, the
                            Ambassador ventures to believe, for an act of the highest statesmanship,
                            such as the recent meeting of President Roosevelt with Prime Minister

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request. He proceeded rather
                            earnestly to thank me for the meeting between him and the President and
                            myself on last Sunday and for the things that were said and done on that
                            occasion as they related to American and Japanese relations. He then
                            said that his Government was considering the communications that were
                            given him by the President and myself to send to his Government; that
                            his Government could not proceed rapidly with the consideration of such
                            matters, and that it would <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0632"
                            />require some days yet for it to make its decisions. He then proceeded
                            to say that in his opinion his Government was very desirous of keeping
                            war out of the Pacific and that, of course, he himself was using his
                            best efforts to that end, and that, therefore, he felt that ways could
                            be found, as they should be, to bring about this peaceful situation.</p>
                        <p>I expressed my interest in and appreciation of what the Ambassador had
                            said. I then reiterated with emphasis the main points in the position of
                            the United States at present and heretofore in support of peace in the
                            Pacific area and said that this Government has nothing new to say or do
                            except to pursue its present course of proclaiming the basic principles
                            of peace and law and justice and equality and fair play alike in the
                            entire Pacific area, to say nothing of the world as a whole, whereas
                            Japan having pursued a different course during recent years is in a
                            situation where she must change vital phases of that course if she
                            really seeks a peaceful settlement in the Pacific such as the Ambassador
                            himself and I personally favor. I said that during the several months of
                            conversation between the Ambassador and myself last Spring and up into
                            June and July the Government controlled press of Japan was fairly
                            shouting the bitterest denunciations against the United States and in
                            favor of going forward with all sorts of so-called “new orders” and
                            “greater new orders” in the Pacific area, while the war element,
                            seemingly led by Matsuoka, were almost shouting their heads off about
                            the Tripartite Agreement, against the United States, and in favor of
                            going forward with force on a program of unlimited expansion to
                            establish the so-called “new order”. I then added that, of course,
                            during those months I could not induce Americans or the English or the
                            Chinese to believe that the Government of Japan was really in earnest
                            about discussing and bringing about a peaceful settlement in the Pacific
                            area and that the President and I have constantly kept the Ambassador
                            and the Japanese Government reminded of this situation, as we did as
                            late as our conversation with the Ambassador on last Sunday and in the
                            message sent to the Government of Japan on that day. I stated that I
                            hoped to keep his Government continuously reminded of this phase, as
                            well as others that have been brought up in writing, if his Government
                            seriously seeks to make a real contribution to a peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that while it had not become a diplomatic incident
                            thus far, the shipment of oil to Vladivostok through Japanese waters
                            would naturally give the Japanese real concern at an early date; that
                            they are faced with large Russian forces in the Vladivostok area and
                            that they cannot be satisfied or content to see what they would firmly
                            believe would be a great building up of Russian military supply bases
                            just across the line from Japan and that, <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                                facs="0633"/>naturally, it would call for discussion in all
                            probability. I remarked jocularly that I wondered whether the stationing
                            of large armies by Japan and Russia facing each other across the border
                            in the Vladi-vostok-“Manchukuoan” area was a method of administering and
                            maintaining the late non-aggression pact entered into between Japan and
                            Russia with great enthusiasm on the part of Matsuoka. The Ambassador
                            only laughed but did so rather significantly. I then said that, of
                            course, this Government at this time is only concerned to see Russia get
                            these and other military supplies in European Russia for the purpose of
                            resisting the German Armies; that this Government has no other motive or
                            purpose than that, and hence the question of building up supplies for
                            the Russian Army in the Far East is not in any sense in view. I stated
                            that this Government is convinced that Hitler is strenuously endeavoring
                            to conquer and destroy everything worthwhile in the Western world, and
                            that we are determined to aid every country—to the fullest extent and as
                            quickly as possible—that is resisting Hitler and that relates to the
                            present situation. I said the Ambassador must be aware of the sincerity
                            of our position and our purpose and that we consider it a compelling
                            one. The Ambassador nodded his head as though he acquiesced at least in
                            our sincerity and our objective whether he agreed with it or not.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Ambassador that, of course, if Japan, which I hoped she
                            would not do, should project herself militarily into the Russian-German
                            situation or into other military situations that would directly affect
                            this Government, an entirely different question would be presented. I
                            then inquired whether the Ambassador had spoken to the Russian
                            Ambassador here on the subject and he replied in the affirmative but
                            seemed to have gotten no particular satisfaction either way out of the
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he supposed we had abandoned the sale of
                            any oil at all to Japan under the freezing system which requires
                            licenses and thus far no licenses have been issued for the sale of oil.
                            I replied that I had not checked fully on the details of this matter;
                            that it ramifies through other departments of the Government. I then
                            stopped long enough to inquire if the Ambassador knew what was taking
                            place between Great Britain and Japan in this respect and he said he did
                            not. I replied that I did not either, but that I would soon check this
                            and our own situation as it related to his inquiry.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then departed, again emphasizing his hope for better
                            relations between the two countries.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at my apartment. He said that since
                            talking with me earlier in the day he had received a despatch from his
                            Government relative to the meeting of responsible heads of the two
                            Governments. The President had indicated if such meeting was to be held,
                            that it might be arranged for about October fifteenth. The Ambassador
                            said that his Government desired to have this meeting earlier than
                            October fifteenth, which he said in all frankness is due to the coming
                            reported military and other conferences with Soviet Russia in Moscow at
                            an earlier date and probably in the first part of September. He
                            indicated that his Government was afraid that some agreements might be
                            entered into at Moscow that would be detrimental to Japan and to Japan’s
                            plans and policies. I replied to his general suggestion by saying that
                            the non-aggression pact between Japan and Soviet Russia would
                            undoubtedly give Japan all of the assurance of Russia’s peaceful
                            attitude towards Japan as Japan could desire. The Ambassador laughed
                            very heartily at this. I said further that I did not know just when the
                            meeting at Moscow was to be held or the complexion of its personnel. I
                            made no promises of any kind in regard to a meeting of responsible heads
                            of the American and Japanese Governments or when it would be held, if it
                            should be held at all.</p>

                        <p>This afternoon the Director of the American Bureau of the Japanese
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs, delivered orally to me the following
                            message to be conveyed to the Ambassador: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Japanese Ambassador in Washington was instructed by telegraph
                                    late last night to call on the Secretary of State and to inform
                                    him that the trend of the internal situation in Japan is causing
                                    the most serious concern and may develop into one of the utmost
                                    gravity largely as a result of the despatch by the American
                                    Government of supplies of oil to the Far Eastern ports of the
                                    Soviet Union. The Ambassador was urgently to request that the
                                    American tankers now en route be recalled pending the decision
                                    on the proposal recently made by the Japanese Government for a
                                    meeting between the President <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569"
                                        facs="0635"/>and the Japanese Prime Minister, and also to
                                    urge upon the United States Government the desirability of
                                    giving favorable consideration to the holding of such a meeting
                                    as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>The Foreign Minister expressed the hope that the American
                                    Ambassador would find it possible to support the request that
                                    the Japanese Ambassador had been instructed to make to the
                                    Secretary. If Mr. Grew did not consider it possible to support
                                    the recommendation that the tankers be recalled, the Foreign
                                    Minister hoped that the Ambassador would feel in a position to
                                    recommend that the tankers be routed so as to avoid passing
                                    through the Straits of Soya and Tsugaru and to proceed to
                                    Vladivostok through the Kurile Straits running between Kamchatka
                                    and the most northerly of the Kurile Islands and thence between
                                    the island of Saghalien and the continent via the Straits of
                                    Tartary. The Foreign Minister was much disturbed by the strong
                                    resentment felt among certain elements in Japan at the
                                    anticipated passage of tankers bearing supplies of gasoline
                                    which might be employed against Japan through waters contiguous
                                    to Japan and he hoped that Mr. Grew would realize that Japan,
                                    entirely apart from the relations between Japan and the Soviet
                                    Union established by the Neutrality Pact, would be placed in an
                                    awkward position through the shipment under the nose of Japan of
                                    supplies to the Soviet Union.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Having delivered the foregoing message to be transmitted to the
                            Ambassador, the Director of the American Bureau in emphasizing its
                            importance stated that the internal situation in Japan was extremely
                            grave and that should there be any premature disclosure at this time of
                            the recent Japanese proposal while these tankers were en route to
                            Vladivostok it would probably bring about further attempts on the lives
                            of leading members of the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation Mr. Terasaki mentioned that the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs would probably ask the Ambassador to call on him
                            either on the following day August 28 or on August 29.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Japan called at his request. He said that he was having
                            decoded a message from his Government to the President in reply to the
                            recent message sent by the President some ten days ago to the Prime
                            Minister of Japan relative to the general state of relations between our
                            two countries. I thanked the Ambassador and said that I would be glad,
                            since he has requested it, to arrange for him to see the President
                            tomorrow morning, if possible, in order that he might deliver this
                            message in person to the President, according to what he says are his
                            instructions from Tokyo.</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>I made one or two general remarks to the effect that progress in our
                            relations depended on whether the Japanese Government has seriously
                            decided to abandon its policy of conquest by force and turn in the
                            opposite direction of peace based on a peaceful settlement of relations
                            in the entire Pacific area such as our two Governments may be able to
                            work out. The Ambassador said that he felt that the note would mark an
                            improvement in the relations of the two countries and would offer
                            opportunities for a gradual increase of these improved relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then took up the matter of our two oil tanker shipments to
                            Soviet Russia through Vladivostok. I said that his protest did not have
                            a thing to stand upon; that these shipments ate entirely legitimate
                            under all laws of commerce; that they are also supported by the
                            Japanese-Russian agreement of Portsmouth;<note n="82" xml:id="d314fn82"
                                >Treaty of peace of September 5, 1905, <ref target="frus1905#pg_824"
                                        ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1905, p.
                                    824</ref>.</note> that they are just as valid acts of commerce
                            as the shipment of vast quantities of oil from this country to Japan;
                            that the amount of these two tankers is microscopic—that is 100,000 or
                            200,000 barrels compared with the hundred million barrels and more which
                            Japan has bought from this country during the past four years; and that
                            it is, therefore, greatly surprising that the Japanese press, much less
                            the Japanese Government, would attempt thus to make a mountain out of a
                            molehill.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired of the Ambassador whether Japan would, as a condition
                            preceding to dealing further with their protest, agree in the future to
                            acquiesce in any objection Soviet Russia may make to Japanese purchases
                            of any oil from the United States. The Ambassador made no reply except
                            to say that the reasons I offered were strong but that the masses of the
                            people in Japan are being required to use charcoal instead of oil and
                            that they are being harangued by the press and public agitators with the
                            reminder that they are not getting any oil from this country while they
                            point to the American tankers passing Japan loaded with oil for Russia.
                            I said this, of course, was purely spurious as an economic or business
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired of the Ambassador just what they wanted us to do, whether
                            in fact they were asking us to turn the ships squarely around and sail
                            them back to the United States, and I proceeded to answer for him by
                            saying that would be preposterous. The Ambassador then said the answer
                            was to let the two Japanese tankers that were leaving this country
                            monthly be loaded with oil to take back to Japan. I inquired whether
                            they could not use some of their free money both in this country and
                            South America to pay for the oil to go in these two tankers. He said he
                            would look into that. I requested him to be sure to do so and let me
                            know further.</p>

                            Government.</p>
                        <p>He then handed to the President a communication from the Prince Premier
                            of Japan to the President of the United States (copy attached).<note
                                n="84" xml:id="d316fn84"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> The
                            President read it with interest and complimented the tone and spirit of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President then spoke somewhat as he did at the last meeting a week
                            ago Sunday about the idea suggested by the Japanese Prime Minister of a
                            personal meeting between the President and the Prime Minister at as
                            early a date as possible for the purpose of having a frank discussion of
                            all important affairs existing between the two countries. The President
                            again spoke of the difficulty of going as far as Hawaii and elaborated
                            on the reasons why it would be difficult to get away for twenty-one
                            days. He then turned to Juneau, Alaska, as a meeting place, which would
                            only require some fourteen or fifteen days, allowing for a three or four
                            days conversation with the Japanese Prime Minister. The only point
                            raised by the Ambassador in this connection was that the conversation be
                            held as early as possible.</p>
                        <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0638"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed to the President a communication from his
                            Government in reply to the communication of the President to the
                            Japanese Government, dated August 17, 1941 (copy attached).<note n="85"
                                xml:id="d316fn85"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_573"
                                    >p. 573</ref>.</note> The President expressed his keen interest
                            to get this reply and proceeded to read it. At two or three stages he
                            stopped to comment briefly and, as he stated each time, study would
                            later, of course, be given to the subject. For example, he remarked that
                            there was nothing in the note to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing
                            their Army and Navy in the Indochina area while the conversations were
                            going on, even though there was no advance whatever by the Japanese
                            forces. At another point he injected some oral comment to the effect
                            that Japan is in no possible danger from Russia at the present time and
                            he emphasized this very strongly. At still another point he referred
                            critically to the Japanese oil complaints and their baseless nature. He
                            then reminded the Ambassador that under the oil quota allowed Japan by
                            this Government, Japan was in a position to have a number of tankers
                            loaded with oil and transported to Japan if and when it so desired.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the reading of the communication, the President said
                            to the Ambassador that he could say to his Government that he considered
                            this note a step forward and that he was very hopeful. He then added
                            that he would be keenly interested in having three or four days with
                            Prince Konoye, and again he mentioned Juneau.</p>

                        <p>I deeply appreciate the courtesy of Your Excellency in delivering
                            personally to Ambassador Nomura the reply of the United States
                            Government to the proposal of the Japanese Government regarding a
                            meeting between Your Excellency and myself.</p>
                        <p>In the face of universal warlike turmoil Japan and the United States are
                            the last two major Powers who hold the key to international peace. That
                            the two nations should fall in the worst of relations at this time would
                            mean not only a disaster in itself, but also the collapse of world
                            civilization. Japan is solicitous for the maintenance of the peace of
                            the Pacific and the peace of the world and she desires therefore to
                            improve Japanese-American relations.</p>
                        <p>The present deterioration of the Japanese-American relations is largely
                            due, I feel, to a lack of understanding which has led to mutual <pb
                                n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0639"/>suspicions and
                            misapprehensions, and also encouraged the machinations and maneuvers of
                            Third Powers.</p>
                        <p>Without first eliminating such causes, it is impossible to expect
                            adjustment of Japanese-American relations. This is why I wish to meet
                            Your Excellency personally for a frank exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>The preliminary informal conversations, disrupted July last, were quite
                            appropriate both in spirit and content. But the idea of continuing those
                            conversations and to have their conclusion confirmed by the responsible
                            heads of the two Governments does not meet the need of the present
                            situation which is developing swiftly and may produce unforeseen
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>I consider it, therefore, of urgent necessity that the two heads of the
                            Governments should meet first to discuss from a broad standpoint all
                            important problems between Japan and America covering the entire Pacific
                            area, and to explore the possibility of saving the situation. Adjustment
                            of minor items may, if necessary, be left to negotiations between
                            competent officials of the two countries, following the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Such is my aim in making the present proposal. I sincerely hope my views
                            in this regard are fully understood and reciprocated by Your
                            Excellency.</p>
                        <p>Because of the nature of the meeting as stated above, I would prefer that
                            it will take place as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Government has received the communication conveyed by the
                            Secretary of State and the President of the United States to the
                            Japanese Ambassador on August 17, 1941. The Japanese Government desires
                            to state its views as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government profoundly regrets that despite the pledge it has
                            given heretofore as well as its repeated explanations concerning Japan’s
                            actions and measures in the foreign field, the United States Government
                            continues to entertain misgivings.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government mentions certain situations and measures
                            which it regards as inimical to a peaceful settlement in the Pacific
                            area. In an atmosphere of world crisis and international confusion, it
                            is sometimes difficult to ascertain when an event is a cause and when it
                            is a consequence.</p>
                        <p>When a nation is obstructed in the path of natural and peaceful
                            development or when the means of its existence is threatened, not <pb
                                n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0640"/>only is it imperative that that
                            nation should take defensive measures, but it is also required to do so
                            for the maintenance of a just peace. This was the motivating policy of
                            the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the United States had taken certain measures which could be
                            interpreted in Japan as indicative of a continuing unfriendly pressure
                            at variance with the then current amicable conversations.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government certainly regards some of its actions as
                            merely counter-measures against Japan’s policy and procedures which were
                            considered as conflicting with American interests and principles. On the
                            other hand, to the Japanese Government those procedures were determined
                            by considerations of self-protection for meeting national requirements
                            or removing environmental and political obstacles against national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>With admirable modesty of mind, the Government of the United States has
                            seemed frequently unaware that its words and policies are automatically
                            weighted with the immense power of America’s accomplished facts, natural
                            endowment and potential might. The President of the United States, and
                            the Secretary of State, in their own unquestioning adherence to the ways
                            of peaceful procedures, might find it difficult to believe that other
                            nations, anywhere, could consider themselves threatened by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Yet, as long as there is lacking the assuagement of that possible threat,
                            there will be some less favorably endowed (especially in essential
                            resources) who will feel compelled to consider defensively their
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>In consequence, the Japanese Government welcomes the invitation by the
                            Government of the United States to an exchange of views in regard to
                            basic policies and attitudes as the foundation of an understanding that
                            will condition lasting and extensive peace in the Pacific area. For such
                            peace, the Government of Japan is ready: for such a united effort toward
                            a peaceful settlement covering the entire Pacific situation the
                            Government of Japan, like the Government of the United States, would be
                            proud to make sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s measure in Indo-China was intended to accelerate the settlement
                            of the China Incident; and at the same time it was calculated to remove
                            all menace to the peace of the Pacific and to secure to Japan an
                            equitable supply of essential materials. It was a measure of
                            self-defense the Japanese Government felt obliged to take. But the
                            Japanese Government has no intention of threatening thereby other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the Japanese Government is prepared to withdraw its troops
                            from Indo-China as soon as the China Incident is settled or a just peace
                            is established in East Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0641"/>
                        <p>Furthermore, in order to remove all possible doubt in this regard, the
                            Japanese Government reaffirms herewith its repeated declaration that its
                            present action in Indo-China is not a preparatory step for military
                            advance into neighboring territories. The Japanese Government believes
                            the above pledge will suffice to clarify also Japan’s intentions toward
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>As regards Soviet-Japanese relations, the Japanese Government declares
                            likewise that Japan will take no military action as long as the Soviet
                            Union remains faithful to the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty and does
                            not menace Japan or Manchoukuo or take any action contrary to the spirit
                            of the said treaty. On the other hand, the Japanese Government sincerely
                            hope that the United States Government will avoid any action that might
                            give rise to a fear of menace to Japan through collaboration with the
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>In a word, the Japanese Government has no intention of using, without
                            provocation, military force against any neighboring nation.</p>
                        <p>Quite properly, discussions between the Japanese Government and the
                            Government of the United States directed toward ascertaining if there
                            existed a basis for negotiations for a peaceful settlement covering the
                            entire situation,—such discussions would naturally envisage the working
                            out of a progressive program, obtainable by peaceful methods. The
                            Japanese Government shares fully that view with the Government of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>It is also stated by the United States Government that no proposals or
                            suggestions affecting the rights and privileges of either the United
                            States or Japan would be considered except as these might be in
                            conformity with the basic principles to which the United States has long
                            been committed. The fundamental national policy long cherished by the
                            Japanese Government is again in full agreement on that point.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the principles and directives set forth in detail by the
                            American Government and envisaged in the informal conversations as
                            constituting, a program for the Pacific area, the Japanese Government
                            wishes to state that it considers these principles and the practical
                            application thereof, in the friendliest manner possible, are the prime
                            requisites of a true peace and should be applied not only in the Pacific
                            area but throughout the entire world. Such a program has long been
                            desired and sought by Japan itself.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government now confidently hopes that from the larger
                            viewpoint of a constructive world peace, and in the light of the current
                            international situation, past differences may be merged in an agreement
                            of principles and a cooperative effort based on order and justice. The
                            meeting of the responsible heads of our respective Governments would
                            confirm and give such sanction to our purposes that peace in the Pacific
                            would be instituted by that meeting.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called by appointment made at his request at the
                            Secretary’s apartment. He expressed his appreciation for the Secretary’s
                            having arranged to have the Ambassador see the President that morning.
                            The Ambassador said that he felt much encouraged from his interview with
                            the President to hope for a successful outcome of our common effort to
                            bring about an improvement in the relations between the two countries,
                            and he added that he has telegraphed a full account of that interview to
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it was his personal opinion that the suggestion
                            of the President that the meeting between the President and the Japanese
                            Prime Minister be held at Juneau would be agreeable to his Government
                            and that the Prime Minister would probably proceed thither by a Japanese
                            warship, making the journey in about ten days. The Ambassador thought
                            that the Prime Minister would be assisted by a staff of about twenty
                            persons, of whom five each would be from the Foreign Office, the Army,
                            the Navy and the Japanese Embassy at Washington. The Ambassador thought
                            that the inclusion of army and navy representatives in the delegation
                            would be especially beneficial in view of the responsibility which they
                            would share for the settlement reached. He said his Government was very
                            anxious that the meeting be held at the earliest possible moment in view
                            of the efforts of a third country and fifth columnists in Japan, who are
                            now behind a press campaign against the United States, to disturb
                            Japanese-American relations. He suggested the period between September
                            21 and 25 as suitable. He said that the question of publicity was
                            something which the two Governments should agree upon, and that involved
                            in the question of timing of any announcement was the fact that the
                            Prime Minister would necessarily have to leave Tokyo about five days
                            before the President left Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would refer these points to the President for
                            his consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then pointed out to the Ambassador the desirability of
                            there being reached in advance of the proposed meeting an agreement in
                            principle on the principal questions which were involved in a settlement
                            of Pacific questions between the two nations. He dwelt upon the serious
                            consequences from the point of view of both Governments which would
                            ensue if the meeting failed to result in an agreement as a consequence
                            of issues arising which could not be resolved, and he expressed the view
                            that the meeting should therefore have as its purpose the ratification
                            of essential points already agreed to <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577"
                                facs="0643"/>in principle. The Secretary pointed out that in the
                            conversations which had taken place last spring difficulties had been
                            encountered in regard to certain fundamental points which had caused
                            delays which finally culminated in Japan’s taking action contrary to the
                            spirit which had animated both the Ambassador and himself in those
                            conversations. The Secretary also pointed out that it would be
                            unfortunate if now, while one half of the Japanese Government was
                            disposed to go along a course of peace the other half should be pulling
                            in the opposite direction.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador reviewed the points in regard to which difficulties had
                            been encountered in the conversations, namely: (1) Japan’s relations to
                            the Axis, (2) the question of the retention of Japanese troops in North
                            China and Inner Mongolia, and (3) the question of the application of the
                            principle of nondiscrimination in international commercial relations. He
                            noted that only in regard to the question of the retention of Japanese
                            troops in North China, concerning which he had no information that his
                            Government had modified its attitude, did he anticipate real difficulty.
                            He observed that with regard to Japan’s relations with the Axis there
                            should be no difficulties, as the Japanese people regarded their
                            adherence to the Axis as merely nominal and as he could not conceive of
                            his people being prepared to go to war with the United States for the
                            sake of Germany. He said he thought our attitude in regard to
                            self-protection was entirely reasonable. The only difficulty that he saw
                            was that to ask that Japan give a blank check for action that the United
                            States might take against Germany in the name of self-defense was
                            equivalent to asking for a nullification of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the Japanese Government had entered into the
                            Tripartite Pact at a most critical moment in our efforts to extend aid
                            to England, and Japan’s action therefore was given particular emphasis
                            in this country. In addition, Mr. Matsuoka kept reasserting gratuitously
                            Japan’s alignment with the Axis. The Secretary said he felt that unless
                            something was done to counteract the effect upon the American people, it
                            might prove a source of serious embarrassment to the President upon his
                            return from the proposed meeting. The Secretary went on to refer to the
                            actual situation in our relations with Germany, to the fact that
                            although no shooting is taking place we are maintaining patrols all the
                            way to Iceland.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador said that with regard to the China question it
                            was the idea of the Japanese Government that we exercise our good
                            offices in bringing the Chinese and Japanese together leaving China and
                            Japan to reach a direct settlement among themselves whereas the United
                            States Government desired to discuss with Japan the basic terms on which
                            peace was to be concluded.</p>
                        <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0644"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were involved in this matter through Japan’s
                            requesting this Government to exercise its good offices. In order to
                            exercise such good offices it was necessary for us to have the
                            confidence and friendship of the Chinese Government before and after
                            exercising those good offices. We could not, he said, propose that the
                            Chinese negotiate with Japan until we knew what the basic terms were
                            which Japan intended to propose and it can be imagined what a difficult
                            situation would be created if, after a meeting between Prince Konoye and
                            the President, an explosion should take place in China as a result of
                            dissatisfaction with the results of that meeting. The Secretary
                            explained further that we could not now afford to have the Chinese think
                            that we were ignoring their interests in going ahead with any
                            arrangements and that it was our idea to help the Japanese achieve the
                            purpose of establishing friendship with China on a solid basis. In this
                            way the Secretary said we could work together, Japan and the United
                            States, in order to make the most of the potentialities of the
                            500,000,000 people of China as a trading nation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that of course the China question was a very
                            important matter but in view of the wide-spread press comments to the
                            effect that the situation had now come to a show-down between Japan and
                            the United States were there not other questions pending between the
                            United States and Japan even apart from the China question which could
                            be disposed of at the meeting with a view to tiding over a critical
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was quite true that there were these other
                            questions but that the China question was one of the pivotal questions
                            underlying relations between the United States and Japan and if this
                            question remained unsettled to the satisfaction of all there would
                            remain the roots of future instability and trouble. The Ambassador said
                            that he recognized the soundness of what the Secretary said especially
                            in view of the French Indochina situation. Mr. Ballantine said he
                            assumed that what the Ambassador had reference to was the Japanese
                            assurance that they would withdraw their troops from French Indochina as
                            soon as the China affair was settled.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then recapitulated briefly what the Secretary had said,
                            namely, that the Secretary considers that there should be an agreement
                            in principle on the outstanding questions of importance prior to the
                            holding of the meeting, that the meeting would serve the purpose of
                            ratifying agreement in principle already reached, that the Secretary
                            considered that the Chinese question was one of the pivotal subjects
                            calling for settlement, and that this Government in exercising its good
                            offices between China and Japan would have to consider the basic terms
                            on which Japan proposed to negotiate. The Secretary said that this
                            represented his views. The Ambassador said <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579"
                                facs="0645"/>that he recognized that what the Secretary said was
                            quite reasonable. The Ambassador had misgivings as to how far the
                            Japanese Government could go on account of the internal political
                            difficulties in Japan. He said, however, that Prince Konoye was a man of
                            great courage and was prepared to assume great risks in bringing to a
                            successful conclusion an effort to improve relations.</p>

                        <p>The Director of the American Bureau telephoned me this afternoon shortly
                            before three o’clock to tell me that although the Foreign Minister had
                            asked me to call upon him at three o’clock this afternoon, in view of a
                            recent development the Minister was afraid of attendant publicity should
                            I visit him and had requested Mr. Terasaki to deliver to me the Foreign
                            Minister’s message on his behalf. <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580"
                                facs="0646"/>Mr. Terasaki accordingly called at the Embassy and on
                            behalf of the Minister conveyed to me for my information the text of the
                            communication from the Japanese Prime Minister to the President which
                            had been delivered by Admiral Nomura in Washington on August 28.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki’s visit was substituted for my call on the Foreign Minister
                            because the Japanese press had learned from Washington that a message
                            from the Japanese Prime Minister had been delivered to the President and
                            the news had reached Japan in such a form that it was impossible for the
                            Government to conceal the fact of such a message from the Japanese
                            public and as a result the Japanese Government felt compelled to issue
                            the statement cabled in my telegram no. 1342, August 29, 4 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki, speaking on behalf of the Foreign Minister, dwelt on the
                            unfortunate effect of the publicity which had been given to this matter
                            in Washington since, although the reports had not disclosed the contents
                            of the Prime Minister’s message to the President, they did reveal to the
                            Japanese public and to the pro-Axis and extremist elements that Prince
                            Konoye had taken the initiative in what was obviously a conciliatory
                            move at a time when indignation was high in Japan as a result of the
                            progressive steps recently taken by the American Government which
                            included the initial order freezing Japanese assets in the United
                            States, the announcement that American tankers bearing oil to the Soviet
                            Union had departed from Californian ports, and the decision to send a
                            military mission headed by General Magruder to Chiang Kai-shek.<note

                            pointed out that the publicity given to the Prime Minister’s message is

                            in this country and has not only rendered further moves in the direction
                            of conciliation very difficult but has in addition immeasurably
                            augmented the possibility of an attempt on the life of Prince Konoye. He
                            added that the Chief of Police this afternoon had indicated the
                            increased risk to the Prime Minister’s life.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the American Bureau conveyed to me from Admiral Toyoda an
                            appeal for transmission to my Government to take the following three
                            steps without which the Foreign Minister feared that Prince Konoye would
                            meet with serious obstacles in his efforts to bring about an
                            understanding between the United States and Japan: <list>

                                <item>The United States Government should postpone the sending of
                                    tankers to the Soviet Union at least pending the outcome of the
                                    proposed meeting between the President and the Japanese Prime
                                    Minister. Mr. Terasaki told me that the Foreign Minister felt
                                    that the dangerous temper of public opinion on the question of
                                    the tankers could not be exaggerated. He added in this
                                    connection that according to information reaching Japanese
                                    authorities five American tankers destined for Vladivostok have
                                    already passed through Tsugaru or Soya Straits.</item>

                                <item>The American Government, pending the proposed meeting between
                                    the heads of the two Governments, should suspend the order

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki, again speaking for the Minister, emphasized to me that the
                            Japanese Government has dealt in complete frankness with the American
                            Government and has assured us that upon the settlement of the China
                            Incident Japanese troops at present in French Indochina would be
                            withdrawn; that the Japanese troops in Indochina would make no further
                            move in that area; and that Japan would observe the treaty of neutrality
                            with the Soviet Union so long as that country adhered equally to the
                            letter and spirit of the treaty. He explained that these were the
                            maximum assurances and commitments which the Japanese Government was in
                            a position to assume at the present time. Since the Japanese Government
                            has gone the limit in giving these assurances, the Foreign Minister
                            believes that the American Government for its part should make a maximum
                            effort, along the lines of the three points outlined above, in order to
                            assist the Prime Minister in the course which he is pursuing, a course
                            which is now fraught with extreme difficulties and dangers as a result
                            of the Washington publicity. Mr. Terasaki told me that the Foreign
                            Minister was appealing to me in an endeavor to have the situation
                            confronting the Prime Minister fully explained to the President and the
                            Secretary and to request that the United States Government approach the
                            suggested concessions not from a legalistic but from a psychological
                            point of view. When Mr. Terasaki concluded the foregoing outline I
                            acquainted him first of all with the substance of the first section of
                            the Department’s telegram no. 544, August 28, 6 p.m.,<note n="88"
                                xml:id="d322fn88">Not printed.</note> which had just been received,
                            setting forth the Secretary’s views upon the objections raised by the
                            Japanese Government to the shipment of oil to the Soviet Union and I
                            took occasion to emphasize the logical and compelling force of the
                            position adopted by the Secretary on this matter. In order that there
                            might be no misunderstanding in regard to the accuracy of the Japanese
                            Ambassador’s reports of his recent conversations <pb n="582"
                                xml:id="pg_582" facs="0648"/>in Washington, I communicated orally to
                            Mr. Terasaki the substance of the Department’s telegrams reporting these
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>In touching on the question of the reciprocal freezing regulations now in
                            force I emphasized once more to Mr. Terasaki the disparity between the
                            very liberal administration of the freezing regulations in the United
                            States in respect to Japanese nationals and the exacting and harsh
                            treatment meted out to American citizens and interests in Japan. Mr.
                            Terasaki in reply merely reiterated that the Foreign Minister’s request
                            had been that such questions be dealt with from the point of view of
                            their psychological effect in Japan since at this period of intense
                            crisis in relations between our two countries the psychological effect
                            was an especially strong one. I then drew Mr. Terasaki’s attention to
                            the mounting anti-American attitude of the Japanese press, to which Mr.
                            Terasaki replied that he could tell me in strictest confidence that
                            certain members of the Cabinet Information Board which was charged with
                            matters relating to publicity are distinctly pro-Axis in their
                            sentiments and that the Japanese Government is encountering real
                            difficulties in handling this question.</p>
                        <p>In discussing with Mr. Terasaki the three points outlined above raised by
                            the Foreign Minister, I left him under no illusion that the United
                            States Government would find it possible to agree to either of the
                            preposterous requests contained in points (2) or (3) above.</p>

                        <p>With reference to Mr. Terasaki’s expression of regret, during his
                            conversation with Mr. Grew on August 29, over the unfortunate publicity
                            which had been given in Washington to the delivery by Ambassador Nomura
                            of a message from Prince Konoye to President Roosevelt, Mr. Grew on
                            August 30 conveyed to Mr. Terasaki for communication to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs the following excerpt from the Secretary of State’s
                            press conference on August 28 (Radio Bulletin No. 205, August 28, 1941):
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“A correspondent remarked that the Japanese Ambassador when he
                                    left the White House said that he had delivered a personal
                                    message from the Head of his Government to the President. The
                                    Correspondent inquired whether the Secretary could say anything
                                    concerning the nature of the message. The Secretary replied that
                                    he thought he should leave that for the Ambassador to handle
                                    with the press as his Government desired it to be handled and
                                    that he had not conferred with him on that point. Asked whether
                                    the delivery of the message eased the situation in the Far East
                                    Mr. Hull said that that was something <pb n="583"
                                        xml:id="pg_583" facs="0649"/>he could not undertake to speak
                                    about definitely. He pointed out that he had remarked to the
                                    press as he came out of the White House that there had been a
                                    general interchange, of information and views relating to
                                    affairs pending between the two Governments, that the
                                    conversation was of interest and that there may be another or
                                    others later. To a question whether they were looking toward
                                    some sort of a written agreement or a verbal arrangement Mr.
                                    Hull said that he could not tell at this time. Asked if a letter
                                    would be sent in answer to the letter which the Japanese
                                    Ambassador delivered today the Secretary replied in the
                                    affirmative saying that naturally he assumed the President will
                                    make due acknowledgment. To a question whether in the exchange
                                    of ideas this morning the position of both countries was again
                                    made plain he said that he did not think he could say more than
                                    what he had on that precise point. In response to an inquiry
                                    whether the message from the Japanese Government could be
                                    described as anything in the nature of a warning to us the
                                    Secretary said that he would not be in a position to go into
                                    either the pros or cons of the discussion that took place and as
                                    to the communication from the Prime Minister to the President
                                    that was as he had said a matter between the correspondents and
                                    the Ambassador of Japan.”</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                            apartment and introduced Mr. Obata<note n="89" xml:id="d324fn89">Mr.
                                Shigeyoshi Obata.</note> who, he said, was educated in America and
                            whose knowledge of English might enable Mr. Obata to help the Ambassador
                            in making sure that the Ambassador understood clearly what the Secretary
                            said.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador first expressed the hope that an early reply might be
                            given to the message from Prince Konoye which the Ambassador had
                            delivered to the President on August 28. The Secretary replied that the
                            President expected to be back in Washington on the following day and the
                            Secretary would talk with the President again about the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then reviewed briefly what he had said to the Japanese
                            Ambassador on the evening of August 28 and the Ambassador, in reply to
                            the Secretary’s inquiry, stated that he had telegraphed a report to his
                            Government of what the Secretary had said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had been endeavoring to feel out the situation
                            with respect to China in an attempt to inform himself as to how the
                            Chinese might react toward the question of a settlement with Japan and
                            he pointed out that, notwithstanding the feeling expressed by the
                            Ambassador that the Japanese did not expect difficulties with the
                            Chinese Government in reaching a settlement, the <pb n="584"
                                xml:id="pg_584" facs="0650"/>Chinese were in fact far from receptive
                            to the idea of such a settlement. The Ambassador said he felt that the
                            only reason that the Chinese were adopting such an attitude was because
                            of the assistance that the United States was rendering China and that if
                            the United States should discontinue that assistance the Chinese would
                            no longer set themselves against Japan. The Secretary pointed out that
                            it would not make for a stabilized peace in the Far East if the Chinese
                            should become embittered and that the Secretary was impressed with the
                            need of retaining the good-will of China in order that this Government
                            might be of maximum assistance in contributing to a settlement which
                            would result in reconciliation between Japan and China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Obata referred to the three fundamental points upon which
                            difficulties had been encountered in reconciling our respective views
                            during the course of the conversations which had been held last spring.
                            He said that while some of the younger officers might hold out on the
                            question of retention of Japanese troops in North China and Inner
                            Mongolia for defense against communism, he thought that agreement on
                            this point and on the other two points, namely the question of the
                            application to Japan’s proposed economic cooperation with China of the
                            principle of non-discrimination in international relations and the
                            question of Japan’s obligations under the Tripartite Pact as they
                            affected our program of self-defense, could easily be adjusted when the
                            meeting took place between the heads of our respective Governments. The
                            Secretary asked what would happen if such an agreement was not reached
                            and repeated his suggestion that we endeavor to reach an agreement in
                            principle on fundamental questions before the meeting should take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador then emphasized the urgent need of making
                            provision for a peaceful settlement in the Pacific area which, he
                            pointed out, was just as much for the interest of the United States as
                            of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Obata raised the question of publicity in regard to the proposed
                            meeting between the heads of our respective Governments, and observed
                            that Prince Konoe could not absent himself from Tokyo without exciting
                            public comment. He suggested that the two Governments might consider
                            making a public announcement about the proposed meeting at an early
                            date. The Secretary replied that this was a point to which we should
                            give appropriate attention.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then mentioned that he had been criticized by his
                            Government for having told the press of his having delivered a message
                            to the President from Prince Konoe, and added that nevertheless the
                            press reaction in Japan had been favorable, which indicated that public
                            opinion in Japan would support a <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi>
                            between Japan and the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was glad to hear this, as press despatches from
                            Tokyo which have been appearing in the press in this country and
                            reporting statements by Japanese spokesmen and publicists emphasizing
                            Japan’s determination to establish for itself a so-called co-prosperity
                            sphere in the Far East and a special economic and political position for
                            herself had prompted many people to make inquiry of him as to whether
                            there was any way in which what Japan demanded could be reconciled with
                            the position of the United States. He said that these expressions of
                            Japan’s objectives and the constant agitation in the Japanese press
                            against the United States created a source of difficulty to this
                            Government in connection with the proposal of a meeting such as the
                            Japanese Government proposed. The Secretary noted that just as the
                            Japanese Government had to reckon with the Japanese public opinion, this
                            Government had to reckon with public opinion in this country and he
                            added that the Japanese press campaign was not only making it difficult
                            to deal with American public opinion but it would also militate against
                            our bringing China, Great Britain and the Dutch East Indies into line
                            with a plan for the establishment of a general program of peace in the
                            Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that, if the Japanese Government now found it
                            difficult to influence the Japanese public and press against agitation
                            in favor of a policy of conquest by force and against conducting a
                            campaign prejudicial to the success of a peaceful settlement with the
                            United States, there was no assurance that the Japanese Government could
                            obtain public support for any such settlement after it had been
                            concluded, and then there might occur in Japan some new political
                            crisis. The Secretary therefore suggested that it would be a part of
                            wisdom for the Japanese Government to exercise its influence with the
                            Japanese press and to point out the benefits that would flow to Japan
                            from a peaceful program such as the Secretary and the Japanese
                            Ambassador had had in mind. The Secretary asked the Ambassador whether
                            he could not urge upon his Government immediate efforts in this
                            direction. The Secretary pointed out that the Japanese Government would
                            have nothing to lose by such a course, even though no agreement with the
                            United States was reached as the Japanese Government would have to its
                            credit efforts to proceed along a peaceful course. The Ambassador said
                            that he would communicate the Secretary’s suggestion to his
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>Having called by appointment, the Director of the American Bureau of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs this evening transmitted to me on behalf of
                            the Foreign Minister the request that I convey to the Secretary of State
                            a message of which the following is the substance:</p>
                        <p>Reports appearing in the American press of the proposed meeting between
                            the responsible heads of our two Governments have reached Japan, and
                            although the necessary measures have been adopted to prevent the
                            appearance of these reports in the Japanese press it is inevitable that
                            the news of the meeting will be rapidly circulated in Japan.</p>
                        <p>I here interposed my opinion that the reports of the proposed meeting
                            were not, in all probability, the result of any disclosure of the
                            American Government but more likely the result of the customary
                            guess-work on the part of certain newspaper correspondents. The Director
                            of the American Bureau answered that according to information received
                            by the Foreign Office Mr. Wilfrid Fleisher<note n="90" xml:id="d326fn90"
                                >Correspondent of the New York <hi rend="italic">Herald
                                Tribune</hi>.</note> was in possession of the actual facts, but that
                            irrespective of its source the result of this publicity would be to
                            increase the opposition to the Japanese Government on the part of
                            rightist elements since it would be alleged that the Government was
                            yielding to American pressure. Mr. Terasaki went on to say that while
                            the Japanese Government does not fear those elements, nevertheless in
                            view of Japan’s association with the Axis powers in the Tripartite Pact
                            it would be desirable to be in a position as soon as possible to
                            produce, for their effect in uniting the nation, definite results from
                            the Prime Minister’s approach, since it is believed that if the pro-Axis
                            elements promptly could be confronted with a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                accompli</hi> any mobilization of these elements against the
                            Japanese Government could be halted.</p>
                        <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0653"/>
                        <p>The Director of the American Bureau said that Admiral Toyoda considered
                            it extremely important that an official announcement of the meeting and
                            its approximate date should be issued as soon as possible. Mr. Terasaki
                            further stated that the Foreign Minister on behalf of Prince Konoye
                            wished to inquire whether the President would find it possible to meet
                            Prince Konoye on or about the twentieth of September or as soon
                            thereafter as possible at the place which the President mentioned in his
                            last conversation with Admiral Nomura, and also whether the Government
                            of the United States would agree to make a joint public announcement
                            with the Japanese Government of this meeting in the immediate future.
                            The Foreign Minister, according to Mr. Terasaki, suggests that the two
                            Governments jointly agree on the text of the announcement and that the
                            words “somewhere in the Pacific” be used to designate the place of the
                            meeting. Terasaki then stated on behalf of the Foreign Minister that
                            Admiral Nomura in Washington is being informed of this inquiry but that
                            the Minister desired that it be conveyed through me. He added
                            incidentally that the Foreign Minister has been much disturbed by the
                            fact that the Japanese Ambassador in Washington had revealed to the
                            press that he had delivered to the President a letter from Prince
                            Konoye.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki continued that should the projected meeting between the
                            President and the Prime Minister fail to materialize, the Japanese
                            Government would be forced to inform public opinion in Japan (1) the
                            reasons for which the Prime Minister had sent a message to President
                            Roosevelt, and (2) the spirit in which the Prime Minister desired to
                            confer with the President. Mr. Terasaki added that he was unable to
                            amplify these two points but he desired to emphasize that they should be
                            regarded merely as a statement of what the Japanese Government would be
                            forced to do and should in no manner be regarded as anything in the
                            nature of a threat. In conclusion Mr. Terasaki stated that the Foreign
                            Minister hoped for an early answer to the above inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Having listened to the statements of the Director of the American Bureau
                            made on behalf of the Foreign Minister, I told him that I seriously
                            doubted whether the President would find it desirable to agree to an
                            announcement before the proposed meeting took place since it had been
                            the original understanding that the fact of the meeting was in itself to
                            be held in strict confidence. I promised, however, to transmit
                            immediately to my Government the Foreign Minister’s inquiry.</p>

                        <p>At the request of the President, the Japanese Ambassador called at the
                            White House this afternoon. The President proceeded at once to read the
                            written oral statement (copy attached)<note n="91" xml:id="d327fn91"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> which had been prepared in
                            reply to the communication recently sent to the President by the
                            Japanese Prime Minister. He emphasized certain points as he read. He
                            particularly emphasized the fact that he appreciated the difficulties of
                            Prince Konoye in connection with the Japanese internal situation, but he
                            added that he has difficulties here which he hopes that Prince Konoye
                            and his Government would appreciate. The President referred to his
                            recent conversations with Prime Minister Churchill, especially that
                            portion relating to plebiscites at the end of the war as the best means
                            of settling many differences and as the soundest policy of dealing with
                            conditions existing between different races. He cited several instances
                            existing at the end of the World War, which were effectively dealt with
                            by plebiscites.</p>
                        <p>The President then proceeded to read his letter to Prime Minister Konoye,
                            a copy of which is hereto attached.<note n="93" xml:id="d327fn93"><hi

                                591</ref>.</note> The Ambassador inquired if the President was still
                            favorable to a conference and the President replied that he was, but
                            that it was very important to settle a number of these questions
                            beforehand, if the success of the conference was to be safeguarded to
                            the extent warranted by the holding of such a meeting. It was also
                            emphasized that if and when we had secured sufficient assurances from
                            the Japanese Government that it stands earnestly for all of the
                            principles which this Government has been proclaiming as applicable to
                            the Pacific area, it would be necessary for us to discuss the matter
                            fully with the British, the Chinese and the Dutch, since there is no
                            other way to effect a suitable peaceful settlement for the Pacific area;
                            that any settlement must be on a basis that will restore confidence and
                            friendliness among the nations concerned; in no other way can a suitable
                            economic structure be rebuilt for that area. The Ambassador seemed to
                            appreciate this viewpoint. Both the President and I repeatedly
                            emphasized the necessity for his Government to clarify its position on
                            the question of abandoning a policy of force and conquest and on three
                            fundamental questions concerning which difficulties had been encountered
                            in our discussion of the Japanese proposal of May twelfth and the
                            discussion of which we had not pursued after the Japanese went into
                            Indochina. The Ambassador said that Prince Konoye, while preferring to
                            go to Hawaii, <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0655"/>would be disposed
                            to go to any place in the Pacific where there was suitable
                            anchorage.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then proceeded to say that he had a despatch from Tokyo
                            referring to the fact that certain elements of opposition to the
                            proposals of the Prime Minister existed and were active in their
                            opposition. He said that the Government, however, is determined to
                            overcome such opposition. He stated that a meeting between the President
                            and the Prime Minister would enable Japan to overcome these
                            disagreements at home and that the opposition would gradually get in
                            line with the Government. He said that Konoye thinks that he and the
                            President can discuss the three questions which were left untouched when
                            the Japanese went into Indochina in July, mainly the question relating
                            to the complete evacuation of Japanese troops from China, the question
                            of non-discrimination in commerce, et cetera, et cetera, and the
                            Tripartite Pact.</p>
                        <p>It was made clear to the Ambassador that several days should be consumed
                            by his Government both in clarifying and stating strongly its position
                            on the principles already referred to and their application so far as
                            China is concerned, and also that their Government should by word and
                            act in every way possible devote some time at once to the education and
                            organization of public opinion in support of the proposals for a
                            peaceful settlement, as already set forth.</p>

                            on August 28, 1941, by the Japanese Ambassador to the President of the
                            United States that there be held as soon as possible a meeting between
                            the responsible heads of the Government of Japan and of the Government
                            of the United States to discuss important problems between Japan and the
                            United States covering the entire Pacific area in an endeavor to save
                            the situation and to the reply of the President of the United
                                States,<note n="94" xml:id="d328fn94"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Infra</hi></note> in which the President assured the Prime Minister
                            of the readiness of the Government of the United States to move as
                            rapidly as possible toward the consummation of arrangements for such a
                            meeting and suggested that there be held preliminary discussion of
                            important questions that would come up for consideration in the meeting.
                            In further explanation of the views of the Government of the United
                            States in regard to the suggestion under reference observations are
                            offered, as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0656"/>
                        <p>On April 16, at the outset of the informal and exploratory conversations
                            which were entered into by the Secretary of State with the Japanese
                            Ambassador, the Secretary of State referred to four fundamental
                            principles which this Government regards as the foundation upon which
                            all relations between nations should properly rest. These four
                            fundamental principles are as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Respect for the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of

                                <item>Support of the principle of non-interference in the internal

                                    be altered by peaceful means.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In the subsequent conversations the Secretary of State endeavored to make
                            it clear that in the opinion of the Government of the United States
                            Japan stood to gain more from adherence to courses in harmony with these
                            principles than from any other course, as Japan would thus best be
                            assured access to the raw materials and markets which Japan needs and
                            ways would be opened for mutually beneficial cooperation with the United
                            States and other countries, and that only upon the basis of these
                            principles could an agreement be reached which would be effective in
                            establishing stability and peace in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States notes with satisfaction that in the
                            statement marked “Strictly Confidential” which was communicated by the
                            Japanese Ambassador to the President of the United States on August 28
                            there were given specific assurances of Japan’s peaceful intentions and
                            assurances that Japan desires and seeks a program for the Pacific area
                            consistent with the principles to which the Government of the United
                            States has long been committed and which were set forth in detail in the
                            informal conversations already referred to. The Government of the United
                            States understands that the assurances which the Japanese Government has
                            given in that statement exclude any policy which would seek political
                            expansion or the acquisition of economic rights, advantages or
                            preferences by force.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is very desirous of collaborating in
                            efforts to make effective in practice the principles to which the
                            Japanese Government has made reference. The Government of the United
                            States believes that it is all-important that preliminary precautions be
                            taken to insure the success of any efforts which the Governments of
                            Japan and of the United States might make to collaborate toward a
                            peaceful settlement. It will be recalled that in the course of the
                            conversations to which reference has already been made, the Secretary of
                            State on June 21, 1941, handed the Japanese Ambassador <pb n="591"
                                xml:id="pg_591" facs="0657"/>a document marked “Oral, Unofficial and
                            Without Commitment” which contained a redraft of the Japanese
                            Government’s proposal of May 12, 1941. It will be recalled further that
                            in oral discussion of this draft it was found that there were certain
                            fundamental questions with respect to which there were divergences of
                            view between the two Governments, and which remained unreconciled at the
                            time the conversations were interrupted in July. The Government of the
                            United States desires to facilitate progress toward a conclusive
                            discussion, but believes that a community of view and a clear agreement
                            upon the points above-mentioned are essential to any satisfactory
                            settlement of Pacific questions. It therefore seeks an indication of the
                            present attitude of the Japanese Government with regard to the
                            fundamental questions under reference.</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that each Government in reaching decisions on
                            policy must take into account the internal situation in its own country
                            and the attitude of public opinion therein. The Government of Japan will
                            surely recognize that the Government of the United States could not
                            enter into any agreement which would not be in harmony with the
                            principles in which the American people—in fact all nations that prefer
                            peaceful methods to methods of force—believe.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States would be glad to have the reply of
                            the Japanese Government on the matters above set forth.</p>

                        <p>I have read with appreciation Your Excellency’s message of August 27,
                            which was delivered to me by Admiral Nomura.</p>
                        <p>I have noted with satisfaction the sentiments expressed by you in regard
                            to the solicitude of Japan for the maintenance of the peace of the
                            Pacific and Japan’s desire to improve Japanese-American relations.</p>
                        <p>I fully share the desire expressed by you in these regards, and I wish to
                            assure you that the Government of the United States, recognizing the
                            swiftly-moving character of world events, is prepared to proceed as
                            rapidly as possible toward the consummation of arrangements for a
                            meeting at which you and I can exchange views and endeavor to bring
                            about an adjustment in the relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>In the statement which accompanied your letter to me reference was made
                            to the principles to which the Government of the United States has long
                            been committed and it was declared that the Japanese Government <pb
                                n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0658"/>“considers these principles and
                            the practical application thereof, in the friendliest manner possible,
                            are the prime requisites of a true peace and should be applied not only
                            in the Pacific area but throughout the entire world” and that “such a
                            program has long been desired and sought by Japan itself”.</p>
                        <p>I am very desirous of collaborating with you in efforts to make these
                            principles effective in practice. Because of my deep interest in this
                            matter I find it necessary that I constantly observe and take account of
                            developments both in my own country and in Japan which have a bearing
                            upon problems of relations between our two countries. At this particular
                            moment I cannot avoid taking cognizance of indications of the existence
                            in some quarters in Japan of concepts which, if widely entertained,
                            would seem capable of raising obstacles to successful collaboration
                            between you and me along the line which I am sure we both earnestly
                            desire to follow. Under these circumstances, I feel constrained to
                            suggest, in the belief that you will share my view, that it would seem
                            highly desirable that we take precaution, toward ensuring that our
                            proposed meeting shall prove a success, by endeavoring to enter
                            immediately upon preliminary discussion of the fundamental and essential
                            questions on which we seek agreement. The questions which I have in mind
                            for such preliminary discussions involve practical application of the
                            principles fundamental to achievement and maintenance of peace which are
                            mentioned with more specification in the statement accompanying your
                            letter. I hope that you will look favorably upon this suggestion.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Terasaki called me by telephone this afternoon to inform me that both
                            Prince Konoye and the Minister for Foreign Affairs wished to retract
                            that portion of the Foreign Minister’s message conveyed to me last night
                            by Mr. Terasaki which dealt with the statement which the Japanese
                            Government would be forced to publish in the event that the projected
                            meeting between Prince Konoye and President Roosevelt did not take
                            place. Mr. Terasaki stated that the Prime Minister and the Foreign
                            Minister both felt that the statement of intention contained in that
                            portion of the Foreign Minister’s message under reference might be
                            misunderstood by the American Government and that any misunderstanding
                            might have an adverse effect upon the proposed meeting between the Prime
                            Minister and the President.</p>

                        <p>I called on the Foreign Minister this afternoon at his request and during
                            the long conversation which ensued he emphasized to me the intention of
                            Prince Konoye and himself to leave no stone unturned to arrange the
                            suggested meeting at an early date between the Prime Minister and the
                            President and to ensure the success of that meeting since, should it
                            fail to achieve its basic aim, he was afraid that further efforts would
                            be useless. Having in view these objectives, the Government of Japan is
                            prepared to state its intentions with complete frankness and to
                            undertake provisionally certain commitments and to set forth, likewise
                            provisionally, certain reciprocal undertakings which the Japanese
                            Government would expect from the Government of the United States. These
                            reciprocal commitments would then serve as a basis for discussion at the
                            proposed meeting between the representative heads of the two
                            Governments. Admiral Toyoda informed me that he had this afternoon
                            cabled this proposal to Admiral Nomura at Washington but he requested
                            that I also convey it to my Government by telegraph in order to obviate
                            any possibility of inaccuracy which he feared might arise through
                            misunderstanding of the English language.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that the Japanese Government was prepared to
                            accept the points on which a tentative agreement had already been
                            reached in the informal and preliminary conversations which had been
                            carried on in Washington and he pointed out, furthermore, that points
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), and (<hi
                                rend="italic">e</hi>) of the proposals set forth below furnish a
                            basis of agreement for three of the chief points which had not been
                            disposed of in these preliminary conversations. The Minister laid
                            particular emphasis on the importance of point (<hi rend="italic"
                            >c</hi>) by reason of the fact that it contemplates an interpretation of
                            Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact at variance with the interpretation
                            which Mr. Matsuoka had given thereto. The importance that the Foreign
                            Minister attached to this point is revealed by the fact that he returned
                            to it several times during the course of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then handed me in writing the Japanese proposals,
                            which are copied below. He requested me urgently to transmit these
                            proposals to Washington in our most secret code and they were
                            accordingly closely paraphrased for transmission to the Department.</p>
                        <p>After a brief examination of the Japanese proposals, I told the Minister
                            that I personally felt that certain of the points outlined would appear
                            to be susceptible to very broad interpretation. The <pb n="594"
                                xml:id="pg_594" facs="0660"/>Minister in reply stated that of course
                            these suggested commitments would be discussed at the proposed meeting,
                            from which I gathered that they were being advanced by the Japanese
                            Government primarily as an indication of the sincerity of Japan’s
                            efforts to work out a basic settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then proposed that the reciprocal undertaking as
                            finally agreed upon should be embodied in an agreement to be kept
                            secret, and that following the meeting between the President and the
                            Prime Minister a statement in general terms would be agreed upon and
                            released to the press. I explained to the Foreign Minister that under
                            our democratic system of Government it would be difficult if not
                            impossible to conceal from the people of the United States such results
                            as might be achieved at the proposed meeting, but we did not pursue the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda told me that while he understood that the President had
                            received the Japanese Ambassador again yesterday he had had no report as
                            yet from Admiral Nomura on this subject. I told the Minister that
                            likewise I had received no information on this reported
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>The proposal of the Japanese Government follows:</p>

                            <p>In connection with the proposals submitted by the Japanese Government
                                it occurs to me that it would not be possible, within the short time
                                which of necessity could be allowed for the proposed meeting between
                                the Prime Minister and the President, to work out a detailed
                                agreement with regard to each one of the points advanced by the
                                Japanese Government in the provisional proposal which would be
                                required before any definite announcement of a concrete nature could
                                be issued to the American people.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the question of publicity following the meeting it
                                seems to me that this problem might be dealt with for the time being
                                by means of a statement that the Government of Japan had subscribed
                                to the principles of international relations which the Secretary of
                                State has enunciated and that a wide program for the reconstruction
                                of the problems affecting the Pacific area which would put those
                                principles into force was being worked out. This announcement might
                                in addition contain the reference to the efforts of both the
                                Japanese and the American Governments looking toward the
                                establishment <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0661"/>of a world
                                based on freedom as outlined by the President, and in conclusion the
                                suggested announcement might state that it was a source of
                                gratification that both Japan and the United States had advanced
                                toward that goal without the sacrifice of their legitimate and fair
                                aspirations and aims.</p>
                            <p>There is an obvious difference between the Foreign Minister’s
                                proposals conveyed to me today and the statements transmitted on
                                behalf of the Prime Minister by Mr. Terasaki on August 29, and I
                                believe that this difference in tone and substance is indicative of
                                the earnest wish of the Japanese Government to achieve a basic
                                settlement with the United States.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s apartment at his
                                request.<note n="96" xml:id="d332fn96">Mr. Obata accompanied the
                                Ambassador.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired how the Ambassador felt about the general
                            situation. The Ambassador replied that he was pleased over the tone and
                            contents of the President’s reply. With reference to the Oral Statement
                            handed to him by the President he said he felt that our request for
                            information in regard to the Japanese Government’s attitude on the three
                            fundamental questions on which our views remained unreconciled at the
                            time conversations were interrupted last July had already been largely
                            disposed of, in spirit at least, by the statement which the Ambassador
                            had given the President on August 28. He said he thought that there was
                            now no essential difference of views between the two governments in
                            regard to the fundamental principles of peace.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated to the Ambassador what he had said many times
                            before in regard to the necessity before entering into any formal
                            negotiations of consulting with the Chinese, the British and the Dutch
                            in order to enlist their support for a broad program of peace in the
                            Pacific area. He pointed out that this was especially necessary with the
                            Chinese who might otherwise be apprehensive lest we betray them. He felt
                            that before we are in a position to go to the Chinese the American and
                            Japanese Governments should reach a clear understanding in principle on
                            the various points to be discussed affecting China. The Secretary said
                            he believed that after these points were cleared up it would enable us
                            to move more rapidly toward taking up arrangements for the proposed
                            meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0662"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that with regard to one of the points at issue,
                            namely Japan’s obligation under the Tripartite Alliance, as those
                            obligations affected and were affected by our self-defense program, he
                            felt that as the Tripartite Alliance was purely defensive and was
                            designed to prevent the entry of the United States into the war he felt
                            sure there was no question of Japan’s attacking the United States should
                            the United States enter the war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that if we went into an agreement with Japan
                            without obtaining explicit assurances on that point difficulties might
                            arise when he went before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>
                        <p>In reply to further questions by the Ambassador in regard to the
                            Secretary’s views on preliminary discussions, the Secretary suggested
                            the desirability of further broadening our proposed commitments
                            affecting trade. He observed that our original proposed formula covering
                            this subject had been successively narrowed down by the Japanese, which
                            he felt was contrary to Japan’s own interest, especially in the light of
                            the exigencies of the problems of economic reconstruction which would
                            arise after a peace settlement has been reached. He said he had been
                            looking into this matter with the economic experts of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had asked his government for instructions in
                            regard to its present attitude toward the three fundamental points at
                            issue and was awaiting his government’s instruction. He then handed the
                            Secretary a new complete draft of the Japanese proposals, which he said
                            was a redraft of ours of June 21, and the Secretary said he would study
                            it.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador rose to go he said he had been asked by his Government
                            to take up the question of a public announcement in regard to the
                            proposed meeting as the Japanese Government considered this urgent in
                            view of the publicity which had already been given. The Secretary said
                            that, while he had no objection to an announcement that formal
                            exploratory conversations were taking place, he felt strongly that any
                            announcement in regard to negotiations should be deferred until we had
                            completed our preliminary discussions and had approached the other
                            interested governments.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the United States and of Japan accept joint
                            responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general agreement
                            of understanding as expressed in a joint declaration for the resumption
                            of traditional friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is the
                            sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led to the
                            deterioration of amicable sentiment between their countries should be
                            prevented from recurrence and corrected in their unforeseen and
                            unfortunate consequences.</p>
                        <p>It is our earnest hope that, by a cooperative effort, the United States
                            and Japan may contribute effectively toward the establishment and
                            preservation of peace in the Pacific area and, by the rapid consummation
                            of an amicable understanding, encourage world peace and arrest, if not
                            dispel, the tragic confusion that now threatens to engulf
                            civilization.</p>
                        <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem ill-suited
                            and weakening. Both Governments, therefore, desire that adequate
                            instrumentalities should be developed for the realization of a general
                            understanding which would bind, meanwhile both Governments in honor and
                            in act.</p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the two Governments that such an understanding should
                            comprise only the pivotal issues of urgency and not the accessory
                            concerns which could be deliberated later at a conference.</p>
                        <p>Both Governments presume to anticipate that they could achieve harmonious
                            relations if certain situations and attitudes were clarified or
                            improved; to wit: <list>

                        <p>This afternoon Prince Konoye conveyed an invitation to me to meet him in
                            secret tonight at a private house but subsequently he <pb n="601"
                                xml:id="pg_601" facs="0667"/>sent word that circumstances had
                            rendered it desirable to postpone the meeting until the following day. I
                            believe that the Prime Minister had wished to talk over with me the
                            reply of the President to his message and the oral statement made to the
                            Japanese Ambassador on September 3 but had on further thought deemed it
                            advisable for Admiral Toyoda to receive me first.</p>
                        <p>I called on the Foreign Minister late this afternoon at his request and
                            he asked me if I had received the text of the President’s reply to the
                            Prime Minister’s letter and the text of the oral communication which was
                            given to Admiral Nomura on September 3, to which I answered that up to
                            the time I left the Embassy only the third section of the telegram from
                            the Department of State on that subject had come in. Admiral Toyoda then
                            showed me the text in English of the two documents referred to above,
                            which had been received by the Foreign Office this morning at two
                            o’clock. He asked for my views concerning the divergencies of opinion
                            between the American and Japanese Governments which had not been brought
                            into conformity when the conversations in Washington were interrupted in
                            July. In reply I told the Minister that when the Department of State had
                            telegraphed me the report of the President’s conversation with the
                            Japanese Ambassador, my own telegram reporting our conversation
                            yesterday afternoon could not have been received in Washington. In view
                            of the fact that the Minister had stated to me his belief that his
                            proposal made yesterday contained the solutions to the divergence of
                            views which had not been solved up to the time the conversations in
                            Washington had been interrupted, I told him that I did not feel free to
                            examine with him these points until I had been informed of the reaction
                            of my Government to his proposal. I undertook, however, at the
                            Minister’s expressed and earnest request to convey to the Secretary an
                            expression of my hope that the opinion of my Government concerning the
                            proposal put forward by the Japanese Government would be sent to me at
                            the earliest possible moment.</p>

                            <p>Admiral Toyoda has told me that he would like to have any further
                                conversations which may be necessary before the proposed meeting
                                between the Prime Minister and the President carried on in Tokyo
                                rather than in Washington because, as he said, certain language
                                difficulties appear to have arisen in Washington. I told him,
                                however, that I could not make any such recommendation since I felt
                                that it was up to my Government to decide where and by whom such
                                conversations should be carried on.</p>
                            <p>After having carefully gone over the reports of the oral discussions
                                which took place concerning our redraft of the original proposals
                                advanced by the Japanese, it was apparent to me that there are four
                                substantial points on which no agreement has been reached, i. e.,
                                (1) the question of equal opportunity and non-discrimination in
                                China, (2) the maintenance of Japanese garrisons in China, (3) the
                                respective attitudes of the United States and Japan toward the war
                                in Europe, and (4) the question of military bases. It is pertinent
                                to examine whether or to what degree the commitments which the
                                Japanese Government is prepared to accept as set forth in points

                                satisfactory in regard to the four points outlined above, and
                                whether these new provisional commitments afford an adequate basis
                                for the proposed meeting between the President and the Prime

                            <p>It is obvious in this connection that no Japanese undertakings
                                whether oral or in written form can be accepted as giving a complete
                                guarantee that such undertakings can or will be carried out to our
                                entire satisfaction. It is clear that the first step toward a return
                                to the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> in the Far East or the
                                establishment of a situation in that area which would conform to the
                                principles which we believe should govern decent relations between
                                states involves the cessation on the part of Japan of its
                                progressive acts of aggression. It would appear that the commitments
                                contained in the latest Japanese proposal, if implemented, would
                                fulfill this requirement. Since it is presumed that a detailed
                                formulation of a general plan of reconstruction of the Far East
                                could not probably be worked out in advance, it would be eminently
                                desirable that the military and economic measures of the United
                                States which are now inexorably pressing on Japan be relaxed point
                                by point <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the actions of the
                                Japanese Government in the direction of implementing its proposed
                                commitments. If our Government followed this suggested <pb n="603"
                                    xml:id="pg_603" facs="0669"/>course it would always retain in
                                its hands the leverage which would contribute to Japanese
                                implementation of its commitments. If an adjustment of relations is
                                to be achieved some risk must be run, but the risk taken in the
                                pursuance on our part of a course which would not only provide
                                inducements to the Japanese to honor their undertakings but would
                                also leave to the United States Government a certain leverage of
                                compulsion would appear to be relatively less serious than the risk
                                of armed conflict entailed in the progressive application of
                                economic sanctions which would result from a refusal to accept these
                                proposals.</p>

                        <p>Following my conversation this morning with Admiral Toyoda during which I
                            carried out the instructions embodied in the Department’s telegram No.
                            562, September 4, 8 p.m.,<note n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">Not printed; see
                                note at end of this document.</note> I had a long conversation with
                            the Director of the American Bureau of the Foreign Office, of which the
                            following is a summary.</p>
                        <p>The Germans and Italians are endeavoring in every way through subordinate
                            officials in the Foreign Office and the Vice Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to obtain knowledge of the character and progress of the
                            conversations between the United States and Japan. Every precaution,
                            however, is being taken to ensure secrecy despite the regrettable
                            publicity which has been given to the Prime Minister’s letter to the
                            President and the reports which have been circulated concerning the
                            projected meeting between Prince Konoye and the President. During Mr.
                            Matsuoka’s tenure of office the Director of the American Bureau was not
                            permitted to see or to exercise any control over the instructions sent
                            to the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin, but since Admiral Toyoda has
                            become Foreign Minister this situation has been corrected. It is still
                            true, however, that there are large numbers of Germans in Tokyo, some of
                            whom are located in Government organizations and strategic positions,
                            and that the German influence is consequently considerable.</p>
                        <p>The Director of the American Bureau told me that the Foreign Office, on
                            the basis of confidential reports, had information that extremist and
                            pro-Axis elements are plotting some form of coup on the anniversary of
                            Japan’s adherence to the Axis on September 27, and since Admiral Toyoda
                            will be host on that evening at a formal dinner to the diplomats of the
                            Axis powers and will be obliged to make <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604"
                                facs="0670"/>a speech, disagreeable and even dangerous incidents may
                            take place. Mr. Terasaki voiced the opinion, as I have pointed out in
                            previous telegrams to the Department, that to confront those opposed to
                            an understanding with the United States with a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                accompli</hi> would be the most efficacious way to forestall their
                            plans. The Japanese Government is apparently confident that the
                            announcement of a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> will be accorded
                            a favorable reception by Japanese public opinion and that such concrete
                            agreements as might be reached will be supported by the great majority
                            of the people.</p>

                        <p>This evening the Prime Minister invited me to dine at a private house of
                            a friend. Only Mr. Dooman and Mr. Ushiba, the Prime Minister’s private
                            secretary, were also present. The conversation lasted for three hours
                            and we presented with entire frankness the fundamental views of our two
                            countries. The Prime Minister requested that his statements be
                            transmitted personally to the President in the belief that they might
                            amplify and clarify the approach through diplomatic channels which he
                            had made in Washington through Admiral Nomura. The following is a brief
                            summary of the salient points as they emerged in the course of our
                            discussion.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Prince Konoye, and consequently the Government of Japan,
                                conclusively and wholeheartedly agree with the four principles
                                enunciated by the Secretary of State as a basis for the
                                rehabilitation of relations between the United States and
                                Japan.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Prince Konoye recognizes that the responsibility is his for the
                                present regrettable state of relations between our two countries
                                but, with appropriate modesty as to his personal capabilities, he
                                likewise recognizes that only he can cause the desired
                                rehabilitation to come about. In the event of failure on his part no
                                succeeding Prime Minister, at least during his own lifetime, could
                                achieve the results desired. <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0671"
                                />Prince Konoye is therefore determined to spare no effort, despite
                                all elements and factors opposing him, to crown his present
                                endeavors with success.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Prime Minister hopes that as a result of the commitments which
                                the Japanese Government is prepared to assume as communicated to me
                                by Admiral Toyoda, a rational basis has been established for a
                                meeting between the President and himself. The Prime Minister,
                                however, is cognizant of the fact that certain points may need
                                clarification and more precise formulation, and he is confident that
                                the divergencies in view can be reconciled to our mutual
                                satisfaction, particularly by reason of the favorable disposition on
                                the part of Japanese naval and military leaders who have not only
                                subscribed to his proposals but who will also be represented at the
                                suggested meeting. The Prime Minister stated that both the Ministers
                                of War and of the Navy have given their full agreement to his
                                proposals to the United States.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The reports which the Prime Minister has received from the
                                Japanese Ambassador concerning the latter’s conversations with the
                                President and the Secretary have led the Prime Minister to think
                                that the Administration in Washington entertains serious doubts as
                                to the strength of the present Cabinet and that the Administration
                                is not certain that in the event that the Cabinet should adopt a
                                peaceful program it could successfully resist the attacks of
                                opposing elements. Prince Konoye told me that from the inception of
                                the informal talks in Washington he had received the strongest
                                concurrence from the responsible chiefs of both the Army and the
                                Navy. Only today he had conferred with the Minister of War who had
                                promised to send a full General to accompany the Prime Minister to
                                the meeting with the President; the Minister of the Navy had agreed
                                that a full Admiral should accompany the Prime Minister. Prince
                                Konoye added in confidence that he expected that the representative
                                of the Navy would probably be Admiral Yoshida, a former Minister of
                                the Navy. In addition the Premier would be accompanied by the Vice
                                Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Navy and other high ranking
                                officers of the armed services who are in entire accord with his
                                aims. He admitted that there are certain elements within the armed
                                forces who do not approve his policies, but he voiced the conviction
                                that since he had the full support of the responsible chiefs of the
                                Army and Navy it would be possible for him to put down and control
                                any opposition which might develop among those elements.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Prince Konoye repeatedly stressed the view that time is of the
                                essence. It might take half a year to a year to work out all the
                                details of the complete settlement and since resentment is daily
                                mounting in Japan over the economic pressure being exerted by other
                                countries, <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0672"/>he could not
                                guarantee to put into effect any such program of settlement six
                                months or a year from now. He does, however, guarantee that at the
                                present time he can carry with him the Japanese people to the goal
                                which he has selected and that should difficulties be encountered in
                                working out the details of the commitments which he may assume,
                                these difficulties can be overcome satisfactorily because of the
                                determined intention of his Government to see to it that its present
                                efforts are fully successful.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>In the course of our discussion I outlined in general terms the
                                bitter lessons of the past to our Government as the result of the
                                failure of the Japanese Government to honor the promises given to me
                                by former Japanese Ministers for Foreign Affairs apparently in all
                                sincerity, as a result of which the Government of the United States
                                had at long last concluded that it must place its reliance on
                                actions and facts and not on Japanese promises or assurances. The
                                Prime Minister did not attempt to refute this statement but stressed
                                the fact that his Government now wished to bring about a
                                thoroughgoing reconstruction of American-Japanese relations and he
                                assured me that any commitments which he would undertake would bear
                                no resemblance to the “irresponsible” assurances which we had
                                received in the past and that such commitments if given would be
                                observed. The Prime Minister concluded his presentation of this
                                point by giving me to understand that given the will the way can be
                                found.</item>

                            <item>Prince Konoye stated that should the President desire to
                                communicate any kind of suggestion to him personally and
                                confidentially he would be glad to arrange subsequent secret
                                meetings with me, but he expressed the earnest hope that in view of
                                the present internal situation in Japan the projected meeting with
                                the President could be arranged with the least possible delay.
                                Prince Konoye feels confident that all problems and questions at
                                issue can be disposed of to our mutual satisfaction during the
                                meeting with the President, and he ended our conversation with the
                                statement that he is determined to bring to a successful conclusion
                                the proposed reconstruction of relations with the United States
                                regardless of cost or personal risk.</item>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                                apartment.<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">Mr. Obata accompanied the
                                Ambassador.</note> He handed the Secretary a document, the contents
                            of which he said had already been communicated to Ambassador Grew <pb
                                n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0673"/>for communication to the
                            Department. The Secretary said that we had received it yesterday. A copy
                            of the document which contains Japanese proposals relating to adjustment
                            of American relations is attached hereto.<note n="4" xml:id="d337fn4"
                                >Infra.</note></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the document had been prepared by the Japanese
                            Government before the receipt by it of the President’s answer delivered
                            on September 3 to Prince Konoye’s message delivered on August 28 but
                            that the Japanese Government felt that the contents of this
                            communication constituted a reply to our statement of September 3,
                            having in mind also the spirit of the statement which the Ambassador
                            communicated to the President on August 28. The Ambassador also referred
                            in this connection to the proposal which he had presented on August 6.
                            The Ambassador said that when the Secretary had spoken to the Ambassador
                            on the evening of August 28 of the desirability of reaching an agreement
                            in principle on the fundamental questions involved before making
                            arrangements for the meeting between the heads of the Governments, the
                            Ambassador had referred the Secretary’s views to his Government and that
                            the proposal which he was now presenting was in response to the
                            Ambassador’s representations to his Government. The Ambassador said he
                            wished to emphasize especially Items B and C in Japan’s proposed
                            commitments as being responsive to our expressed attitude and stressed
                            also his opinion that in the light of circumstances in Japan this was
                            the maximum by way of concessions that Japan could offer at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he and his associates would during the week-end
                            go over the document presented by the Japanese Ambassador as he was
                            naturally anxious to proceed as rapidly as possible. The Secretary then
                            repeated what he had said many times in regard to the desirability of
                            preparing the public in matters of this kind in order to insure public
                            support. The Japanese Ambassador then said that not only was it
                            necessary to hasten the matter of preliminary discussions but also the
                            matter of an announcement. The Secretary then said that he perceived no
                            objection to the Japanese Government letting it seep out that informal
                            and exploratory conversations were proceeding.</p>

                        <p>The Director of the American Bureau called on me this morning at the
                            request of the Foreign Minister and on the latter’s behalf conveyed to
                            me a message of which the following is a brief summary.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister is concerned over the recent incident in which the
                            American destroyer <hi rend="italic">Greer</hi> is involved since he
                            feels that the German Government, which is said to be asserting that
                            this incident constitutes an unprovoked aggressive act by the United
                            States, may claim that it falls within the purview of article 3 of the
                            Tripartite Pact. Admiral Toyoda mentions this incident as further proof
                            of the necessity of expediting the suggested meeting between the Prime
                            Minister and the President.</p>
                        <p>I told the Director of the American Bureau that I was sending for the
                            record a letter to the Foreign Minister setting forth the main points of
                            the official statements made by the President and the Navy Department
                            concerning the incident involving the <hi rend="italic">Greer</hi>. I
                            likewise told Mr. Terasaki that I had already brought to the attention
                            of the Secretary of State Admiral Toyoda’s views, which he had expressed
                            to me several times, concerning the importance of holding the proposed
                            meeting with the least possible delay.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda through Mr. Terasaki expressed to me the hope that
                            officials of the American Government would refrain from making any
                            public mention of the conversations between the United States and Japan
                            which had been carried on in Tokyo and in Washington because any such
                            publicity would make it much more difficult for the Foreign Minister to
                            control dissident groups and opposing influences in Japan.</p>

                        <p>I called on Admiral Toyoda this evening at six o’clock and carried out
                            the instructions contained in the Department’s telegram No. 573,
                            September 9, 11 a.m.<note n="6" xml:id="d340fn6">Not printed; it
                                directed the presentation of the statement, <hi rend="italic"
                                    >infra</hi>.</note> I made it clear to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs that the inquiries made were of an exploratory and preliminary
                            nature and that further questions might emerge from additional study on
                            the part of my Government of the proposals submitted by Japan. Admiral
                            Toyoda listened carefully to my remarks and to the questions presented
                            and answered that before giving me a reply he would examine the points
                            in question.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister told me that he did not have in his possession the
                            text of the draft proposal delivered on September 4 by the Japanese
                            Ambassador in Washington to the Secretary of State. The Minister and
                            also Mr. Terasaki who attended the meeting said that they could not
                            entirely understand question number one since they understood that the
                            draft of September 4 did not supersede and cancel out any of the terms
                            (as, for example, the use of good offices by the President of the United
                            States in regard to bringing the hostilities between Japan and China to
                            a close) on which previous agreement had been reached during the
                            conversations in Washington. Admiral Toyoda and Mr. Terasaki both made
                            it clear that their remarks in this connection were off the record and
                            unofficial.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States is at present examining the proposals
                            communicated to the American Ambassador by His Excellency the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs on September 4, and also communicated to the
                            Secretary of State by His Excellency Admiral Nomura on September 6.</p>
                        <p>The American Government has in view an agreement conforming to the
                            principles and methods which it has put forward; an agreement under the
                            terms of which China would receive just and equitable treatment; in
                            which the rights and interests of all Pacific powers would be given due
                            consideration; and which would make a substantial contribution toward
                            the establishment and maintenance of a just, <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611"
                                facs="0677"/>stable and orderly peace. Since the hostilities
                            existing between Japan and China are a basic factor in the problem of
                            reaching a general settlement in the Pacific area, a fair and just
                            settlement of their controversies by China and Japan is an essential
                            condition to any general solution of the Far Eastern problems which
                            might be expected to provide for the future peace and stability of that
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The proposal as originally advanced by the Japanese Government provided
                            for the exercise of good offices by the President of the United States,
                            and the Japanese Government was informed that the Government of the
                            United States was not prepared to suggest to the Chinese Government that
                            it undertake negotiations with the Japanese Government unless the
                            Government of the United States was convinced that the terms which the
                            Government of Japan had in mind were consistent with the principles to
                            which the American Government is committed. A deadlock was reached in
                            the informal discussions between our two Governments in regard to these
                            terms as a result of the insistence on the part of the Japanese
                            Government that Japanese troops were to be stationed in Inner Mongolia
                            and North China for an unspecified period, and also because of the fact
                            that the Government of the United States was not able to elicit from the
                            Japanese Government specific assurances that the principles of
                            non-discrimination in commercial relations between nations would be
                            applicable to the program of economic collaboration with China which
                            Japan proposed to adopt. The Government of the United States has
                            consistently sought an agreement the aim and terms of which shall lead
                            to an all-embracing and durable peace in Eastern Asia and in the area of
                            the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The latest proposals submitted by the Japanese Government, it would
                            appear, seek to break the deadlock, not by responding to the desires of
                            the United States Government on the above points, but by proposing that
                            Japan shall negotiate with China directly, on the premise that, since
                            the good offices of the President are not to be sought, the Government
                            of the United States would not be concerned with the character of the
                            terms of peace which Japan intends to propose to China or with the
                            progress of the conflict between China and Japan. Any such premise as
                            the foregoing passes over or ignores the intention of the United States
                            Government, which has been repeatedly impressed upon the Japanese
                            Ambassador, to confer with the Government of China, Great Britain, The
                            Netherlands, et cetera, before it could agree to embark on any
                            definitive negotiations with the Japanese Government regarding a
                            settlement involving the Pacific area. This intention of the Government
                            of the United States is based on its view that the peace of the Pacific
                            is not a question which can be decided by the United States and Japan
                            alone but is a question <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0678"/>in
                            which other powers having interests in the Pacific have a legitimate
                            concern and unavoidable responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Nor would the Government of the United States be prepared to conclude any
                            agreement which would restrict the degree of assistance that it is now
                            rendering or may in the future wish to render to nations which are
                            engaged in resisting aggression. It is possible to assume that the
                            Government of China, to no less a degree than the Government of Japan,
                            desires to effect a peaceful solution of its controversies with Japan,
                            and that, therefore, provided the Japanese Government is ready to
                            propose equitable and just terms to the Chinese Government, the two
                            nations should find it possible to settle their difficulties. In the
                            event of such an occurrence the need for any provision such as that
                            embodied in point (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the commitments which it
                            is proposed that the Government of the United States undertake would
                            appear to be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the considerations set forth above it is clear that some
                            further initiative from the Japanese Government is required in order to
                            effect a solution of the above-mentioned difficulties. It would be of
                            assistance to the Government of the United States if an answer could be
                            obtained from the Japanese Government to the following questions which
                            have arisen as the result of the discussions:</p>
                        <p>1. In point (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the provisional commitments
                            which the Japanese Government is to undertake it is indicated that Japan
                            is prepared to subscribe to the points upon which tentative agreement
                            had already been reached during the informal preliminary conversations
                            held in Washington. Does the Japanese Government have in mind the points
                            whose formulation as set forth in the draft of the Government of the
                            United States of June 21 are identical to those appearing in the draft
                            which was handed to the Secretary of State by the Japanese Ambassador on
                            September 4, or to those appearing in some prior draft?</p>
                        <p>Should the answer to the first question propounded in paragraph 1 be in
                            the affirmative it would seem that certain of the stipulations contained
                            in the proposals conveyed to the American Ambassador by the Japanese
                            Foreign Minister on September 4 are more limited than are the
                            undertakings provided for in the formulae on which tentative agreement
                            had been previously reached. As an example, in point (<hi rend="italic"
                                >f</hi>) the Japanese Government undertakes to refrain from
                            discrimination in matters of international commerce in the area of the
                            southwest Pacific.</p>
                        <p>2. With relation to the example above cited affecting point (<hi
                                rend="italic">f</hi>), is it the intention of the Japanese
                            Government not to undertake similar commitments in regard to its
                            economic activities in other regions notably in China?</p>
                        <p>3. In regard to the general question of international commerce, further
                            clarification would be desirable with regard to the meaning <pb n="613"
                                xml:id="pg_613" facs="0679"/>of the provisions of point (<hi
                                rend="italic">e</hi>) relating to American economic activities in
                            China, namely, the precise meaning of the term “equitable basis” and
                            whether this term is intended to mean that Japan shall be the sole judge
                            in determining what constitutes an equitable basis.</p>
                        <p>4. Is the Government of the United States to understand that the terms of
                            peace which Japan intends to propose to China will be in conformity with
                            the several points appearing in the Annex to Section 3 of the draft
                            submitted by the Japanese Ambassador on September 4 which is referred to
                            above?</p>
                        <p>In connection with the formula outlined under point (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) dealing with respective attitudes of the United States and
                            Japan towards the European war, while the American Government considers
                            that this formula does not fully meet the requirements of the situation
                            since it leaves Japan free to interpret independently any commitment on
                            this score, the Government of the United States would like to examine
                            the question further before putting forth any suggestion.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                                apartment.<note n="7" xml:id="d342fn7">Mr. Obata accompanied the
                                Ambassador.</note> He said that he had been instructed by his
                            Government to express the hope that the President in his forthcoming
                            speech would not touch upon Japanese-American relations in a way that
                            might give ammunition for pro-Axis elements in Japan to conduct
                            agitation likely to embarrass the Government. The Ambassador said that
                            the Japanese Government of course recognized that this was a matter
                            which lay entirely within the discretion of the American Government, but
                            that incidents like the <hi rend="italic">Greer</hi> incident were
                            arousing feeling among the pro-Axis elements in Japan. The Secretary
                            replied that he could not undertake to say what the contents of the
                            President’s forthcoming speech were and that the only answer he could
                            give was that the President’s speech was already prepared. The Secretary
                            added that he understood that the Japanese Ambassador’s suggestion was
                            along the lines of a point which had frequently come up in their
                            conversations in regard to the desirability of avoiding anything that
                            might exacerbate Japanese-American relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then inquired what the Secretary’s reaction was to the
                            Japanese Government’s proposals of September 6. The Secretary commented
                            that it seemed to us that whereas our previous conversations had related
                            to a broad and liberal understanding covering the entire Pacific area,
                            the present proposals had narrowed <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614"
                                facs="0680"/>down the spirit and the scope of the proposed
                            understanding. The Secretary also observed that, in regard to the matter
                            of the Tripartite Pact, as this was a military alliance and as Germany
                            was engaged in a movement of world conquest the situation presented real
                            difficulties for this Government which he did not see how the new
                            proposals met.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Obata said that as the Japanese Government concurred in all the
                            points in which tentative agreement had been reached in our previous
                            conversations the Ambassador and he felt that the new proposals did not
                            serve to narrow the scope and the spirit of the original proposals. The
                            Secretary then suggested that if we were under a misunderstanding, the
                            misunderstanding should be cleared up and suggested that Mr. Hamilton
                            and Mr. Ballantine meet with the Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Obata in an
                            endeavor to clear up all doubtful points. The Ambassador expressed fear
                            lest further delay arise through carrying on conversations in regard to
                            details. The Ambassador said that the Japanese Government had emphasized
                            to Mr. Grew the desirability of proceeding as rapidly as possible. The
                            Secretary said that Mr. Grew had been instructed that he might discuss
                            the subject with the Japanese Government by way of explaining points
                            that might not be clear in regard to our attitude and in obtaining
                            clarification of Japanese points of view, but that this Government
                            desired to conduct the conversations here at Washington.</p>
                        <p>After a little further discussion the Ambassador concurred in the
                            Secretary’s suggestion. It was then left to Mr. Ballantine to get in
                            touch with Mr. Obata by telephone after Mr. Ballantine had consulted Mr.
                            Hamilton.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Schmidt called at the Japanese
                            Embassy in pursuance to an arrangement which the Secretary of State made
                            with the Ambassador earlier this morning.<note n="8" xml:id="d343fn8"
                                >Mr. Obata and Mr. Matsudaira were also present.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Obata opened the conversation by saying that both he and the
                            Ambassador had been surprised to learn this morning of the
                            “misapprehension” of the American Government that the proposals
                            communicated by the Japanese Ambassador on September 6 represented a new
                            approach by the Japanese Government and superseded the progress which
                            had been made in the informal conversations held before that time Mr.
                            Obata said that the Japanese Government, he <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615"
                                facs="0681"/>believed, intended all points previously tentatively
                            agreed upon were “to stand” and that in addition the other assurances
                            which the Japanese Government has made, in particular the communications
                            which Prince Konoye had sent through Ambassador Nomura to the President,
                            were also to be considered as representing the attitude and intent of
                            the Japanese Government. Ambassador Nomura confirmed Mr. Obata’s
                            remarks. Mr. Ballantine asked if this meant those portions of our June
                            21 draft which were identical with earlier Japanese drafts were still to
                            be considered as representing a part of the proposed agreement between
                            our two Governments. Mr. Obata replied that he believed that to be so
                            but added that the document which Ambassador Nomura had given the
                            Secretary on September 4 represented merely the Ambassador’s personal
                            views and had not been referred to the Japanese Government and therefore
                            did not represent, necessarily, the views of the Japanese Government.
                            Mr. Ballantine then observed that we might take the draft of June 15
                            which the Japanese Ambassador had given the Secretary as a basis for
                            comparison and that if the points in that draft together with the other
                            assurances mentioned were to stand, there appeared to be certain
                            inconsistencies between the September 6 proposals and earlier Japanese
                            proposals or drafts.</p>
                        <p>Reference was made by Mr. Ballantine to the provisional commitment on the
                            part of the Japanese Government labeled (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) in
                            the document received September 6, in which Japan undertakes not to make
                            “any military advancement from French Indochina against any of its
                            adjoining areas”. He mentioned that Prince Konoye had previously given
                            assurances concerning the withdrawal of Japanese troops from French
                            Indochina as well as broad assurances regarding the peaceful intent of
                            the Japanese Government. Mr. Obata replied that of course the assurances
                            of Prince Konoye were not in the least modified by this latest proposal.
                            Mr. Ballantine pointed out that in the report forwarded by Mr. Grew of
                            these Japanese proposals, Japan had undertaken not to attack, “without
                            any justifiable reason” any regions lying north of Japan, whereas in the
                            document handed to the Secretary on September 6 the Japanese had given
                            the same undertaking against regions south of Japan and not north. Mr.
                            Obata said that they would immediately inquire of the Japanese
                            Government whether “north” or “south” was meant. Mr. Obata also agreed
                            to ask his Government whether the qualification “without any justifiable
                            reason” applied to any military advancement against areas adjoining
                            Indochina as well as to regions lying south (or north) of Japan. Mr.
                            Obata referred to the assurances given by Prime Minister Konoye that
                            Japan did not intend to use military force against any nation without
                            provocation and indicated <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0682"/>that
                            in his opinion those assurances covered this question entirely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine then took up the question of the Japanese commitment (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) and observed that the Japanese undertaking to
                            withdraw its armed forces from China after the “rehabilitation” of
                            general and normal relationship between Japan and China was vague and
                            indefinite. He inquired whether the Japanese still intended, as they had
                            proposed originally on May 12, that the President of the United States
                            would use his good offices in bringing the Chinese and Japanese
                            Governments together for direct negotiations. Mr. Obata said that he
                            believed that that was still the intention of the Japanese Government.
                            The Japanese Ambassador was not positive but said that he also believed
                            his Government still intended to request the President to suggest to the
                            Chinese Government that it enter into direct negotiations with the
                            Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine pointed out that, as the Secretary had
                            said early in the conversations, if this Government were to approach the
                            Chinese Government with such a suggestion the Chinese Government would
                            naturally ask us on what basis the Japanese Government proposed to
                            negotiate peace. We would therefore want to be in a position to inform
                            the Chinese Government of the basic peace terms of the Japanese
                            Government and to indicate to the Chinese Government that those peace
                            terms were in harmony with the fundamental principles to which the
                            people and the Government of the United States are committed. Mr.
                            Hamilton added that, as the Secretary had already told the Japanese
                            Ambassador, we had long believed that Japan’s best interests as well as
                            the best interests of this country and other countries interested in the
                            Pacific would be served by avoiding any possibility of bitterness on the
                            part of China. He pointed out that for the past nine years we have
                            realized that far more can be accomplished by broad, liberal and
                            progressive policy in international relations than by a narrow or
                            conservative policy, and suggested indirectly that it would be in
                            Japan’s best interests to follow policies and procedure along those
                            lines toward China. Mr. Hamilton went on to say that, to speak with
                            complete frankness, there were many critics of Japan in this country who
                            believed the Japanese Government would or could not observe its
                            commitments and who were outspoken in their criticisms of Japan’s
                            previous acts in breaking treaties and agreements. He suggested that it
                            would be of great value in disarming such critics and in proving to the
                            world the good intentions of Japan were the Japanese Government,
                            immediately following the conclusion of agreement, actually to take some
                            action, such as withdrawal of troops, which would clearly demonstrate
                            that the Japanese Government now intends to follow courses of peace and
                            broad, liberal policies. He observed that with regard to the <pb n="617"
                                xml:id="pg_617" facs="0683"/>withdrawal of Japanese troops from
                            China, we had in the past endeavored to obtain some indication of an
                            approximate schedule which the Japanese Government might have in mind
                            for such withdrawal. Mr. Obata agreed entirely with what was said and
                            expressed the view that the Japanese Government had drafted these
                            proposals made on September 6 in an effort to provide a basis for
                            settling the three questions which remained outstanding when the
                            informal conversations were disrupted last July and to provide one or
                            two other points for discussion.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the provision for the withdrawal of Japanese armed forces
                            from China, Mr. Obata remarked that this question represented a very
                            difficult problem and suggested that this Government prepare a draft for
                            submission to the Japanese Government of the commitment which it would
                            be desirable to obtain from Japan on this subject. Mr. Ballantine
                            suggested that we had on numerous occasions made clear our belief that a
                            successive withdrawal of Japanese armed forces from China as speedily as
                            possible until complete was desirable. He observed that the Japanese
                            Government was obviously in a better position than this Government to
                            state explicitly its intentions and capabilities in regard to this
                            question—in other words, the Japanese Government is far more able than
                            this Government to draft a concrete formula. Mr. Hamilton remarked that
                            at the present time we should first dispose of the general questions
                            which we had brought up today before going on to the next step.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine observed that the undertaking marked (<hi rend="italic"
                                >e</hi>) on the part of the Japanese Government, that economic
                            activities of this country in China would not be restricted “so long as
                            pursued on an equitable basis”, was not clear. Mr. Obata agreed that the
                            phraseology was bad and indicated that in his opinion this was meant to
                            apply to present conditions and areas now under Japanese military
                            occupation and control. Mr. Hamilton pointed out that the wording in
                            this paragraph suggested that Japan had a special position or special
                            right in China and added that we were not concerned primarily with the
                            present situation in China but were endeavoring to draft a clear picture
                            of what the situation in China and in the Pacific area in general would
                            be following a general settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine remarked that under commitment (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)
                            the Japanese had limited the application of the principle of
                            non-discrimination in international commerce to the “southwestern
                            Pacific area” and inquired whether it was the intention of the Japanese
                            Government that this principle should be applied to the entire Pacific
                            area. Mr. Obata said again that he believed that the previous
                            tentatively agreed upon commitment given in Section 5 of the June 21
                            draft would be <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0684"/>concurred in by
                            the Japanese Government and that, as indicated by Prince Konoye, Japan
                            desired to see those principles applied not only to China but to the
                            entire Pacific area. Mr. Ballantine recalled that the Secretary of State
                            had told the Ambassador a few days ago that he had instructed economic
                            experts in the Department to study the question of cooperation between
                            the United States and Japan in economic affairs in the Pacific area. As
                            a result of that study a new draft of Section 5 of the proposed
                            agreement had been prepared. Mr. Ballantine gave a copy to Mr. Obata for
                            his reference. (Copy attached.) It was pointed out that in our
                            estimation the adoption of a formula such as contained in this new draft
                            would be to the interests of the Japanese. Mr. Hamilton stated that this
                            redraft of Section 5 was of course entirely tentative and merely
                            intended for the consideration of the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question as to what was meant by the provisional commitment
                            on the part of the Government of the United States marked (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>), the Japanese Ambassador said that he believed
                            the Japanese Government desired that that Government cease giving aid to
                            China. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine pointed out that the fundamental
                            purpose of the proposed understanding was peace in the Pacific, that
                            presumably peace would be arranged between Japan and China, and that
                            this would make unnecessary any reference to the question of aid by this
                            Government to China. Mr. Ballantine remarked that we assumed the Chinese
                            Government to be equally interested in a just peace and therefore if the
                            Japanese Government were to offer a just and equitable settlement to
                            China there was no reason to expect the Chinese Government would not
                            accept such an offer. Mr. Hamilton went on to say that, as the Secretary
                            had previously informed the Ambassador, this Government, before
                            completing any agreement, with Japan, would expect to discuss the
                            question with the Chinese Government and with other governments
                            interested in the Pacific area for the reason that the question of peace
                            in the Pacific and a general settlement of Pacific problems is not one
                            which can be determined by Japan and the United States alone, but is one
                            in which other governments are interested and share the
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine remarked that we had sent a telegram to Ambassador Grew
                            covering the main points which had been brought up in today’s
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hamilton said that we desired this afternoon merely to present
                            certain points which were not entirely clear to us and that we believed
                            that once we had received clarification of these points from the
                            Japanese Government we could make further progress in our study. Mr.
                            Obata suggested that this Government prepare a complete draft on the
                            basis of earlier drafts by this Government and by the Japanese <pb
                                n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0685"/>Government and also taking into
                            consideration the Japanese earlier proposals in regard to Indochina and
                            the communications which Prince Konoye has made. Mr. Obata said that he
                            believed in view of the agreement on principle, as already expressed by
                            Prince Konoye, we should have no difficulty in phraseology. Mr. Hamilton
                            replied that he believed it would be more desirable to wait until
                            questions which we had raised today had been clarified before attempting
                            a new redraft of the proposed agreement. Mr. Obata concurred and said
                            that they would telegraph the Japanese Government immediately and would
                            expect to have a reply by tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="smallcaps">Comment</hi>: We came away from the conversation
                            with the distinct feeling that Ambassador Nomura and Mr. Obata
                            themselves were somewhat vague in regard to the intent of the Japanese
                            Government and the meaning of the various points in the proposals given
                            to the Secretary on September 6. They appeared to be positive on only
                            the one point that the Japanese Government desired to arrange a meeting
                            between the heads of states as soon as possible.)</p>

                        <p>I called on the Foreign Minister this evening at his request for an
                            interview which lasted one and a half hours. Mr. Terasaki and Mr.
                            Inagaki of the American Bureau of the Foreign Office, and Mr. Dooman
                            also attended.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda first read and then handed me the text of the instructions
                            which the Minister said were to be telegraphed that night to Admiral
                            Nomura in Washington, setting forth replies to a number of questions
                            which Admiral Toyoda told me Mr. Hamilton, under instruction from the
                            Secretary of State, had asked the Japanese Ambassador on September 10. A
                            copy of these instructions to the Japanese Ambassador, which I cabled in
                            paraphrase this evening to the Department, is attached<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d344fn9">Infra.</note> to this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki, at the request of the Foreign Minister, began by reading in
                            English from a paper written in Japanese a statement of which the
                            following is a summary: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It had been the Minister’s intention that the tentative
                                    proposals which he had delivered to Mr. Grew on September 4, and
                                    which had been handed to the Secretary of State by the Japanese
                                    Ambassador on September 6, should embrace every one of the
                                    points upon which preliminary agreement had been reached in the
                                    informal conversations in Washington. Concurrently it was the
                                    Minister’s desire to obviate long drawn out discussions of
                                    details which might delay or in other ways impede the holding of
                                    the suggested meeting between the President and the Japanese
                                    Prime Minister since the time element was essential.</item>

                                <item>It is not the intention of the Japanese Government to reduce
                                    or curtail in any way whatever the points on which preliminary
                                    agreement had been reached in the aforesaid conversations. In
                                    actual fact the undertakings which Japan is now willing to
                                    assume transcend in scope the points on which agreement had been
                                    reached in Washington. The Japanese Government has in mind a
                                    program which is certainly far more extensive than the
                                    previously agreed points. While the present proposals are
                                    designed to obviate long drawn out discussion of details at the
                                    present time, the Japanese Government is willing to discuss such
                                    details once it is agreed that the responsible heads of the
                                    American and Japanese Governments shall hold a meeting.</item>

                                <item>The Government of the United States has indicated its desire
                                    to confer with the Governments of Holland, Great Britain, and
                                    other countries concerning the matters under discussion between
                                    Japan and the United States. Although the Japanese Government
                                    feels compelled to state that any agreement which may be
                                    achieved between the United States and Japan must be of a
                                    bilateral nature, it entertains no objection whatsoever to the
                                    Government of the United States carrying <pb n="621"
                                        xml:id="pg_621" facs="0687"/>on any consultations which it
                                    may desire to hold with other interested nations.</item>

                                <item>It was the Minister’s understanding that the proposals which
                                    he had handed to me on September 4 had as yet not been seen by
                                    the President, and it was the Minister’s earnest hope that they
                                    might be brought to the attention of the President as soon as
                                    possible. In reply to this, I stated that the Secretary of State
                                    was in constant communication with the President in regard to
                                    the conversations in progress and that it was up to the
                                    Secretary to decide what data should be brought to the
                                    President’s attention and at what time.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>After listening to the Preamble outlined above, I stated that the
                            Government of the United States had up to the present made no definite
                            answer to the proposals which the Minister had delivered to me on
                            September 4 and that they were still being discussed. I said that it was
                            the hope of my Government that preliminary conversations would make it
                            possible to clear up those points of the proposals submitted by the
                            Minister which are susceptible of broad construction and thereby to
                            ensure that the meeting between the President and Prince Konoye, if and
                            when it took place, would be a success. I pointed out that should the
                            meeting fail of success, appalling consequences would ensue.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda then gave me orally answers to the questions which I had
                            on September 10 put to him as instructed in the Department’s telegram
                            No. 573, September 9, 11 a.m.<note n="10" xml:id="d344fn10">Not
                                printed.</note> In giving me these replies the Minister drew my
                            attention to the fact that although certain of his replies which were in
                            answer to the questions asked the Japanese Ambassador by Mr. Hamilton
                            and to those which I had put to him were either identical or mutually
                            inclusive, he had considered it advisable, in order to avoid possible
                            confusion, to draw up separately the answers to the two groups of
                            questions. The answers of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the
                            questions which I had put to him on September 10 are as follows: <list>
                                <item>First. The Japanese Ambassador had presented to the Secretary
                                    of State on September 4 a draft statement which represented the
                                    Ambassador’s personal and private views and it was consequently
                                    an unofficial document. The Foreign Office had subsequently been
                                    informed by Admiral Nomura that he had withdrawn this statement.
                                    As a consequence the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not think
                                    it would be necessary to go into the question of the effect of
                                    Admiral Nomura’s draft statement of September 4, which he
                                    subsequently withdrew, on the points on which tentative
                                    agreement had already been reached.</item>
                                <item>Second. In so far as the question relating to item (<hi
                                        rend="italic">f</hi>) of the Minister’s proposal is
                                    concerned, there is no intention on the part of the Japanese
                                    Government to discriminate in commercial matters in the area of
                                    the southwestern Pacific and in other regions, in particular
                                    China. However, in regard to China it is necessary to consider
                                    this <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0688"/>question in the
                                    light of observations set forth in the reply to be given to Mr.
                                    Hamilton in response to his question on this point.</item>
                                <item>Third. As to the significance of the words “equitable basis”,
                                    these words refer to activities of an economic nature which are
                                    not discriminatory in nature and which are non-monopolistic,
                                    non-exploitive, and non-exclusive, modified, however, by the
                                    natural unavoidable factors referred to in point (<hi
                                        rend="italic">e</hi>) of the answer to be given to Mr.
                                    Hamilton. It follows therefore that Japan alone is not to decide
                                    what is meant by “equitable basis”.</item>
                                <item>Fourth. In so far as the formula set forth in point (<hi
                                        rend="italic">c</hi>) of Admiral Toyoda’s proposal is
                                    concerned, the reply in substance would be similar to that set
                                    forth above in “First”. In regard to the wish of the Government
                                    of the United States further to study the formula in question,
                                    Admiral Toyoda stated that in consequence thereof he would
                                    refrain from further comment on this point until such time as
                                    the Government of the United States would desire to raise some
                                    question in regard to that formula. The Minister “deemed it
                                    advisable” that a further elucidation of the formula proposed by
                                    the Japanese Government should be discussed by the President and
                                    Prince Konoye at the projected meeting.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda in conclusion again emphasized the urgency of a meeting
                            between the responsible heads of our two Governments with the least
                            possible delay. He said that attempts were being made to prevent this
                            meeting being held. He said that while many of these obstacles arose out
                            of the internal situation in Japan, more dangerous still are the
                            indications of third Powers aimed to forestall the holding of the
                            meeting. The Minister again made reference to the fact that on September
                            27 would fall the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact. In adverting again
                            to the opposition to the suggested meeting which is being manifested by
                            certain elements in Japan, he earnestly and seriously expressed the hope
                            that the Government of the United States would very soon find it
                            possible to decide the question in the affirmative. I told the Minister
                            that although I had already drawn the attention of my Government to the
                            considerations which he had just outlined, in view of the great weight
                            which he attributed to the urgency of speedy action I would again
                            transmit his views to the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>I also told Admiral Toyoda of the substance of the final paragraph of the
                            Department’s telegram No. 573, September 9, 11 a.m., regarding the
                            continuance in Washington of any definitive discussions concerning the
                            reaching of an agreement on principle.</p>

                            has been constituting a basis for informal negotiations between [the]
                            Japanese and the United States Governments will continue to be a basis
                            for further discussions.</p>
                        <p>The points upon which we deem a tentative agreement has already been
                            reached during the informal preliminary conversations in Washington
                            comprise the preamble to the proposed understanding, the concepts of the
                            United States and of Japan respecting international relations and the
                            character of nations, and the matter concerning the good offices of the
                            United States to the relations between Japan and China.</p>
                        <p>Although it seems that there is a misunderstanding on the part of the
                            United States that Japan does not want [the] good offices of the United
                            States in the settlement of China affairs, the Japanese Government has
                            by no means refused the good offices of the President of the United
                            States and is still, as before, wishing for them.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The terms “without any justifiable reason”

                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the undertaking to which Japan is
                            ready to commit itself.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) For the purpose of preventing communistic and
                            other subversive activities threatening the safety of both Japan and
                            China and also of maintaining the peace and order in China, Japan and
                            China will cooperate in the form of common defense. The execution of the
                            common defense by Japan and China will contain the stationing of
                            Japanese troops for a certain period in accordance with the agreements
                            between both countries. The Japanese troops which have been sent to
                            China with the object of executing the China affairs will be withdrawn
                            when the said affairs have been settled.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The reason why the Japanese Government
                            inserted point (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) as a matter to be undertaken
                            by Japan is because the Japanese Government, in view of the apprehension
                            on the part of the Government of the United States that Japan might
                            violate the American rights and interests in China, wishes to show her
                            intention of not obstructing any <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0690"
                            />just and equitable economic activities of the United States in China.
                            The Government of Japan will not only admit the principle of
                            nondiscrimination with regard to commerce in China as well as in [the]
                            Southwestern Pacific Area, but also it fully respects the established
                            rights and interests of the United States in China. However, it
                            considers that the especially close economic relations between Japan and
                            China natural from their geographical propinquity are the same kind of
                            relations as those which exist between any other two neighboring
                            countries. Indeed, there will be no reason why the principle of close
                            economic relationship owing to the geographic propinquity shall not be
                            applied to Japan’s economic relations with China. Accordingly, the close
                            and especial economic cooperation between Japan and China within this
                            limit will not establish so-called monopolistic or preferential rights
                            and interests for Japan. Moreover, it is firmly believed that such is a
                            natural phenomenon in our human life, and the observance of this law of
                            nature is not only a factor of bringing about economic prosperity of the
                            world, but the surest way for the firm establishment of the world
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Since matters relating to China, as has been
                            stated above, are covered under point (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>), the
                            matter concerning Japan’s economic activities in the Southwestern
                            Pacific Area was clarified under point (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) in
                            view of the fact that among other areas of the Pacific the United States
                            is most concerned with the Southwestern Area of the Pacific.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Ambassador to England, called today and we
                            discussed the current conversations between the United States and Japan.
                            I gathered the impression that Mr. Shigemitsu had called on me with the
                            knowledge of Prince Konoye or the Foreign Minister. Mr. Shigemitsu
                            reviewed the Japanese attitude toward these conversations roughly as
                            follows: (1) the present Japanese Government is united in support of the
                            current endeavors to bring about an adjustment of relations with the
                            United States; (2) <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0691"/>the time
                            factor, however, is of the greatest importance since groups in Japan who
                            are against any adjustment of relations with the United States and the
                            efforts being made in that direction are progressively mobilizing their
                            forces; (3) should the efforts of the Prime Minister toward an
                            understanding with the United States end in failure, there is no other
                            statesman in Japan who would be able to bring about the desired solution
                            since from both a political and a social point of view the present
                            position of the Prime Minister is unusually strong.</p>
                        <p>I explained to Mr. Shigemitsu the grave dangers of embarking upon
                            official negotiations without and prior to the establishment through
                            preliminary talks of an adequate and agreed basis. I mentioned as well
                            the broad construction which could be placed upon some of the points in
                            the proposals put forward by the Japanese Government, and took occasion
                            also to refer to the past experiences of the American Government as a
                            result of the failure of Japan to carry out a number of assurances and
                            promises which a succession of Japanese Foreign Ministers had made to
                            me. Mr. Shigemitsu, while admitting the soundness of my remarks, told me
                            that the situation at the present time was different from any in the
                            past when the Japanese military had declined to carry out undertakings
                            which the Foreign Minister had made. At present, Mr. Shigemitsu said,
                            the responsible chiefs of the armed forces are supporting the policy of
                            the Government and as a result of this support Prince Konoye is able to
                            bring about a new course of policy. To illustrate his point Mr.
                            Shigemitsu said that the Japanese Government could be compared with
                            someone who had scaled a high fence and had his feet planted on the
                            other side on new ground. He said in addition that although it was a
                            physical impossibility to set down ahead of time all details relative to
                            the carrying out by Japan of the undertakings which the Japanese
                            Government might assume, the sincerity and will of the Konoye Government
                            is such that the faithful execution in the course of time of any
                            agreement which may be reached can be counted on with complete
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shigemitsu told me in the strictest confidence that the initiative in
                            the direction of an understanding with America and England had come from
                            the Emperor personally and that his own recall from London was related
                            to this general subject. Mr. Shigemitsu told me that he had been
                            received for two hours by the Emperor and could assure me that even
                            during Mr. Matsuoka’s tenure of office and Japan’s adherence to the Axis
                            the Emperor’s wishes for the development of friendly relations with the
                            United States and Great Britain had never wavered.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Ushiba<note n="11a" xml:id="d347fn11a">Private Secretary to the
                                Japanese Prime Minister.</note> called me on the telephone yesterday
                            afternoon at my house, asking whether he could call on me immediately. I
                            told Mr. Ushiba that I had gone to bed with a cold, but that if he
                            wished to risk the chances of an infection I would be glad to see him
                            for a short while. Mr. Ushiba arrived at about five o’clock and stayed
                            until shortly before seven.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba asked whether the Ambassador had received any comment from
                            Washington on his report of the meeting which recently took place
                            between the Ambassador and the Prime Minister. I replied that the
                            Secretary of State had telegraphed in appreciative terms concerning the
                            attitude and views of Prince Konoye, but that a paper which Admiral
                            Nomura had handed in to the State Department on September 4 had so
                            confused matters that the Ambassador had not felt that he had sufficient
                            material to warrant his asking for a further meeting with the Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba said that the Cabinet had been completely upset by the
                            information which Mr. Grew gave Admiral Toyoda on September 10 with
                            regard to the action of Admiral Nomura. He said that Admiral Nomura had
                            received from Prince Konoye a draft which was responsive to the American
                            draft of June 21, but that in view of the Cabinet crisis in Japan
                            Admiral Nomura had not handed in that document. He had instead written a
                            brief letter to the Secretary of State which was not in any way helpful.
                            Mr. Ushiba gathered that the Nomura paper of September 4 was not the
                            draft received from Tokyo, for the reason that one of the basic ideas of
                            the Japanese Government has been right along to have recourse to the
                            good offices of the President in opening up a path between Japan and
                            China—and apparently Admiral Nomura’s paper of September 4 made no
                            reference to the good offices of the President.</p>
                        <p>I then explained to Mr. Ushiba the combination of circumstances which had
                            led to difficulty in Washington in understanding precisely what the
                            position of the Japanese Government was, say as of September 4. I hoped
                            that we were succeeding in untangling the crossed wires, but the loss of
                            a week or more in straightening matters out was due in no part to any
                            action of ours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba remarked with surprising candor that he did not blame our
                            Government in any way for wanting to know precisely what the aims and
                            objectives of the Japanese are before committing itself to such a
                            dramatic move as that of a meeting between the heads of Government <pb
                                n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0693"/>of the United States and Japan.
                            After all, the crux of the problem was China. He felt that the Japanese
                            Government had shown very clearly that it proposed to maintain the
                            principle of the Open Door in China, but that it had failed thus far to
                            indicate clearly the terms which it would propose to China for
                            settlement of the China conflict. Months had dragged on in conversations
                            in Washington, and the Secretary of State had all along shown very
                            clearly that he did not intend to commit the American Government in any
                            decision until he knew in advance what the Japanese peace terms were and
                            was satisfied that those terms were in conformity with the principles
                            which he advocated for the regulating of relations between nations. Mr.
                            Ushiba suggested that our Government should ask the Japanese Government
                            to disclose those terms, as he could assure me that his Government would
                            immediately respond to any such request. I said that I was unable to
                            follow him in those observations: as Mr. Ushiba had himself suggested,
                            we had long expressed desire to know the character of the Japanese peace
                            terms; in our draft of June 21, Section III, we had inserted a phrase
                            which was designed to indicate that the Japanese Government would have
                            communicated those terms to the American Government before any approach
                            was to be made by the President to the Chinese Government. I had
                            therefore assumed that failure on our part to be apprised of the
                            Japanese peace terms was caused by refusal on the part of the Japanese
                            Government to disclose them to us. Mr. Ushiba said that he did not know
                            precisely how the present situation arose, but that he could assure me
                            that the Japanese Government would be only too glad to communicate the
                            terms to the President and to have the President show them to the
                            Chinese and other interested Governments. After some discussion, it
                            seemed desirable that the initiative with regard to communication to us
                            of the peace terms come from the Japanese side. Mr. Ushiba would suggest
                            to Prince Konoye that he communicate the terms to Mr. Grew as further
                            evidence of the good faith of the Japanese Government and of its
                            eagerness to enter into formal negotiations with the American
                            Government. It was also agreed that if Prince Konoye should feel that
                            some further initiative should come from the American side, Mr. Grew—if
                            he felt that he was in a position to do so—would express to Prince
                            Konoye desire to be apprised of the character of the Japanese peace
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed the question of the attitude of the United States and
                            Japan respectively toward the European war. Mr. Ushiba said that it was
                            impossible for Japan to give to the United States a prior undertaking
                            that it would interpret as a defensive act any action on the part of the
                            United States against Germany which might lead to war between the United
                            States and Germany. He thought that the <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628"
                                facs="0694"/>formula which had been communicated by Admiral Toyoda
                            to Mr. Grew was about as far as the Japanese Government could go prior
                            to the proposed meeting. He added, however, that an understanding had
                            been reached among the various influential elements in Japan which would
                            enable Prince Konoye to give orally and directly to the President an
                            assurance with regard to the attitude of Japan which, he felt sure,
                            would be entirely satisfactory to the President. Another matter which
                            troubled him very much in this connection was precisely in what terms
                            the Japanese Government would explain to Germany any understanding which
                            might be reached with the United States on this point. I remarked that
                            the United States, which was committed to supporting the principle of
                            the sanctity of treaties, could not well request Japan to betray its
                            treaty commitments. It seemed to me, however, that there was a very
                            definite difference between the Treaty of Alliance, with its rights and
                            obligations, and the formulation of policies by the concerned allies. It
                            followed as a matter of course that allies pursued policies which served
                            their common end, but there was no obligation arising out of the Three
                            Power Alliance which required Japan to follow policies which would serve
                            exclusively the ends of Germany. Could not, therefore, Japan inform
                            Germany that Japan had undertaken to pursue policies conformable to
                            those of the United States, although Japan was prepared to fulfill its
                            obligations under Article III of the treaty? Technically the Alliance is
                            a defensive alliance; and it is clear from the rescript issued by the
                            Emperor at the time of the signing of the Alliance that it was then
                            considered by the Japanese Government as an instrument for peace. Mr.
                            Matsuoka informed certain of the Ambassadors in Tokyo upon his return
                            from Moscow that, in the event of a war occurring between Germany and
                            the United States, Japan would consult its allies with regard to the
                            antecedent circumstances, and that he felt confident that the Japanese
                            Government would decide, in almost every conceivable instance, to enter
                            the war on the side of Germany. Mr. Ushiba expressed amazement. He said
                            that he knew that Mr. Matsuoka had interpreted Article III of the
                            Alliance in a sense which was entirely contrary to Prince Konoye’s
                            interpretation, but that he did not know that he (Mr. Matsuoka) had
                            disclosed his interpretation to representatives of foreign Governments.
                            Apropos, he said that Mr. Matsuoka had told the Prime Minister that Mr.
                            Grew had reported to Washington that the last Cabinet change was due to
                            American pressure on Japan. I told Mr. Ushiba that we had reported
                            nothing of the sort. I said that I could tell him in confidence that we
                            had reported that the Cabinet change was due chiefly to two causes:
                            first, the German attack on Soviet Russia, which upset Japanese
                            expectation, when signing the <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0695"
                            />Alliance, that peace would be maintained between Germany and Russia;
                            and, second, the conflict of interpretations by the Prime Minister and
                            Mr. Matsuoka with regard to the scope and significance of the Triple
                            Alliance. Mr. Ushiba said that we had been entirely correct.</p>
                        <p>The concluding portions of the conversation were devoted largely to Mr.
                            Ushiba’s stressing the importance of the American Government’s returning
                            a favorable reply to the Japanese proposal as soon as possible. Mr.
                            Ushiba reverted again and again to the approach of the 27th of
                            September, the first anniversary of the signing of the Alliance.<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d347fn12">On September 18, 1941, the Counselor wrote
                                the following memorandum: “Mr. Ushiba today telephoned to me to say
                                that Prince Konoye would within the next day or two convey to the

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                            apartment. The Ambassador said that he had received nothing further from
                            his Government than that the Foreign Minister had made to Mr. Grew an
                            explanatory statement in regard to the Japanese proposals, and that the
                            Ambassador had received a report of that explanatory statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had received Mr. Grew’s report of his
                            interview on September 13 with the Foreign Minister and of the
                            explanatory statement which had been made to Mr. Grew. We had
                            subsequently received a telegram from Mr. Grew stating that he had been
                            informed that the Japanese Government was going to communicate to him
                            the basic peace terms which the Japanese Government proposed offering to
                            China. The Secretary added that we had hoped that the Ambassador might
                            communicate those terms to us this evening.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had not yet received any instructions on this
                            point; that he had reported carefully to his Government our views but
                            that he had received nothing beyond what had been communicated to Mr.
                            Grew. He asked whether the explanatory statement made to Mr. Grew
                            cleared up matters so as to place us in position to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the explanatory statement did not in our opinion
                            advance us materially and that we still felt the proposals of September
                            6 narrowed down the original program.</p>
                        <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether it was not a fact that the principal
                            difficulty was the question of the withdrawal of the Japanese troops
                            from China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was an important difficulty, but that there
                            was also the question of getting the proposal back to the broad basis
                            covering the entire Pacific area along the lines that we had
                            consistently talked about throughout the course of our informal
                            discussions. He added it would be inconsistent with such a purpose if
                            Japan should be proceeding along a peaceful course in one direction
                            while pursuing an opposite course in another direction. This, he said,
                            would not serve our ends or Japan’s.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether we had yet proposed any new suggestions with
                            reference to the question of the relations of the two countries to the
                            European war. The Secretary replied that we had not yet expressed any
                            views on the formula contained in the Japanese proposals on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had informed his Government of our views in
                            regard to the question of the withdrawal of the Japanese troops from
                            China, but that he was still without instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he hoped we would soon hear from the Japanese
                            Government, but that he realized that the Japanese Government had more
                            difficulties than we had to encounter in determining their position. He
                            added that we were no less desirous than they were in moving as rapidly
                            as possible, and that while awaiting further word from the Ambassador we
                            were continuing to study the proposals.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that his Government wanted to make it clear that
                            while it did not have anything to say in the matter of this Government’s
                            consulting third governments, its proposal to us was for a bilateral
                            agreement. The Secretary said that, as he had on frequent occasions
                            indicated to the Ambassador, we had no idea of bringing other countries
                            in on our proposed agreement with Japan, but desired to work out
                            independently with those powers programs which would be consistent with
                            and supplement our arrangement with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether the Ambassador anticipated any
                            developments in Japan on the occasion of the anniversary (September 27)
                            of the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. The Ambassador gave no
                            indication that he was apprehensive of any untoward developments. In
                            reply to a further question of the Secretary he replied that he did not
                            think that more than one-tenth of one per cent of the population of
                            Japan desired to enter the war on Germany’s side. He said it was true
                            that the Japanese Army was very influential and that many officers were
                            German-trained and admired German military technique, but that this did
                            not mean that the Army as a whole desired to go into the war on the side
                            of Germany.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador, after saying again that he had nothing new to present but
                            had merely dropped in for a general chat, took his leave.</p>

                        <p>I called on the Foreign Minister this afternoon at his request. After
                            reading from a document in Japanese which was then translated into
                            English, he made substantially the following oral statement: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The suggestion that the President meet with Prince Konoye was
                                    contained by implication in the message received by the
                                    President from the Prime Minister.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The Japanese Government had intended that at the proposed
                                    meeting there should be discussed the questions at issue between
                                    the two countries requiring agreement, and that subsequently
                                    through normal diplomatic channels the details for executing the
                                    understanding reached at the meeting should be worked out. The
                                    Government of the United States, however, had adopted the view
                                    that the problems which had emerged from the preliminary and
                                    informal conversations should be agreed on in advance of the
                                    meeting.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Foreign Minister had explained that in his statement made
                                    to me on September 4 he had replied to all of the questions
                                    raised by the Government of the United States and that his
                                    statement of September 4 had widened rather than reduced the
                                    subject matter of the negotiations which the Japanese Government
                                    is willing to undertake.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Foreign Minister then gave me the basic terms of peace
                                    which Japan is prepared to offer China to be communicated to the
                                    Secretary of State.<note n="13" xml:id="d349fn13"><hi
                                            rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> The Minister emphasized
                                    that these terms should not be regarded as a new proposal but as
                                    in relation and supplementary to his statement to me of
                                    September 4 when he confirmed that the Japanese Government still
                                    desired to seek the good offices of the President in bringing
                                    the conflict with China to an end.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Admiral Toyoda told me that there had been great changes in
                                    the internal situation here since a month ago due to the
                                    publicity which had been given abroad to the suggested meeting
                                    between the President and the Japanese Prime Minister and due to
                                    the published reports and references on radio broadcasts abroad
                                    in regard to the conversations in progress between Japan and the
                                    United States. As a result of the efforts of the Japanese
                                    Government, public opinion in Japan and the Japanese press in
                                    the main are not aware of the developments referred to above,
                                    but the publicity abroad is known to certain groups in Japan and
                                    has had the effect of increasing the activities of those
                                    elements in Japan who are opposed to an understanding with the
                                    United States.</item>

                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>The Government of Japan will attempt to guard against any
                                    incidents or special occurrences in connection with the
                                    anniversary on September 27 of Japan’s adherence to the Axis and
                                    will allow its anniversary to be celebrated by private
                                    organizations. However, should a considerable lapse of time
                                    occur following the anniversary without any sign as to the
                                    attitude of the United States, the groups referred to above who
                                    are against an understanding with the United States and who are
                                    informed of the Japanese-American conversations might find it
                                    possible to so enflame public opinion in Japan as to render very
                                    difficult the continuation of these talks.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>Admiral Toyoda pointed out that the Japanese Government is
                                    still awaiting the American answer to the various points set
                                    forth by him in his statement of September 4 and expressed to me
                                    his belief that in that statement the Japanese Government had
                                    with complete frankness revealed to the American Government its
                                    intentions and desires. (End of Minister’s statement.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In reply to the Minister’s question whether any further information had
                            been received from Washington, I conveyed to him the substance of the
                            Department’s 603, September 20, 4 p.m.,<note n="14" xml:id="d349fn14"
                                >Not printed; it reported the conversation of September 19, 1941;
                                see memorandum, <ref target="#pg_629">p. 629</ref>.</note> which had
                            been decoded immediately prior to my call on the Minister. Admiral
                            Toyoda was especially struck by the Secretary’s remark to the Japanese
                            Ambassador that the Government of the United States fully shared the
                            desire of the Japanese Government to hasten matters. The Minister
                            expressed the thought that although the desire of the United States
                            Government to confer with other Governments in regard to the suggested
                            agreement was clearly recognized, the element of delay which would be
                            involved in such consultations might have a most unfortunate effect.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the lack of concern felt by the Japanese Ambassador in
                            Washington regarding the anniversary on September 27 of Japan’s
                            adherence to the Axis, Admiral Toyoda expressed the view that Admiral
                            Nomura was not close enough in touch with the situation in Japan to be
                            cognizant of the dangers in this respect. I told the Minister that I was
                            surprised that he had not conveyed to the Japanese Ambassador in
                            Washington his own concern on this point.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the terms of peace between Japan and China, I told the
                            Minister that I wished to avoid any comment until the Government of the
                            United States had had a chance to examine these terms but that for
                            purposes of clarification I would like to know the exact meaning of the
                            words “existing agreements and usages” mentioned in point three. The
                            Minister in reply stated that these words must be understood as written;
                            however, he referred in this connection to the presence in China of
                            American marines merely by way of an illustration of the phrase in
                            question.</p>
                        <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>I promised the Minister that I would communicate to the Secretary
                            immediately his statement given above and also the terms of peace
                            between Japan and China which he had handed to me. But I added that in
                            view of the communications which had been exchanged between the
                            Governments of Japan and the United States I could not be optimistic
                            that a decision on these important matters could be reached before the
                            27th of September.</p>

                        <p>I was called to the Foreign Office this afternoon by the Director of the
                            American Bureau who orally made a statement, which he stressed was being
                            conveyed to me at the direction of the Foreign Minister, for
                            communication to the Ambassador and for transmission by Mr. Grew to the
                            Government of the United States. This statement, Mr. Terasaki said, is
                            to be considered supplementary to the statements which Admiral Toyoda
                            made to the Ambassador during their conversation yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The attached text has been prepared from the full notes which I took

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                            apartment. The Ambassador read from notes an oral statement
                            substantially the same as that contained in Tokyo’s 1497, September 22,
                            8 p.m.<note n="17" xml:id="d352fn17">Not printed; see memorandum by the

                        <p>The Ambassador said that what he had now placed before us was a full
                            expression of what the Japanese Government desired to say to us and that
                            the question of anything further by way of clarification in regard to
                            Japan’s relations to the Tripartite Pact might best be left to the
                            proposed meeting between the heads of our two Governments. He hoped that
                            this Government would be able as soon as possible to give a reply to the
                            Japanese Government’s proposals. The Secretary replied that we would, of
                            course, study the papers which the Japanese Ambassador had given us as
                            expeditiously as <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0701"/>possible with
                            a view to making a reply. He asked the Ambassador what the Ambassador’s
                            impressions were in regard to the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that of course he understood very well the
                            position of the American Government and he also appreciated the
                            difficulties in the domestic situation in Japan. He said his hope was,
                            however, that if we should proceed to have a meeting it would have a
                            psychological effect in Japan in setting Japan on a new course. The
                            Secretary referred to suggestions he had previously made of the
                            desirability of the Japanese Government’s being allowed time to assert
                            control of public opinion and thus attain support for a liberal program
                            such as we had discussed in our conversations. He asked the Ambassador
                            whether the Ambassador thought that a meeting between the heads of
                            states would contribute more to setting Japan upon a new course than the
                            taking of the steps which the Secretary had suggested. The Ambassador
                            said that he had not failed to communicate to his Government the
                            Secretary’s suggestion and he thought that the Japanese Government had
                            already taken steps in that direction and that these steps had produced
                            good results. He said that, as he had noted on previous occasions,
                            perhaps not more than one-tenth of one percent of the Japanese people
                            desired war with the United States, although of course if ordered to go
                            to war the Japanese people would be ready. He felt that the holding of a
                            meeting such as suggested would be of great value in counteracting the
                            influence of the pro-Axis elements in the Japanese Government and in
                            providing support for those elements desiring peaceful relations with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary brought up again the great opportunity that was now
                            presented for Japan and the United States to work together along
                            peaceful and progressive lines and he said he could not emphasize too
                            much his view that by following such a course both countries would stand
                            to gain more than through any other course. He referred to the fact that
                            for the last ten years the youth in Germany had received no other
                            training than for war and that no country could benefit from the
                            staggering burden of armaments that warlike policies were imposing upon
                            the world. The Ambassador said that he fully shared the Secretary’s
                            views on these points.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that as this country had been following
                            courses of peace and was committed to these courses there was very
                            little that we could offer Japan in the way of bargaining. He then
                            repeated that he would give careful and expeditious study to the papers
                            which the Japanese Ambassador had presented and would communicate with
                            the Ambassador as soon as possible.</p>

                            accompanying document, the original copy of which was delivered to the
                            United States Ambassador at the American Embassy in Tokyo on September
                            25, 1941.</p>
                        <p>For the information of the Secretary of State the Japanese Ambassador
                            desires to add that, in handing the document to the United States
                            Ambassador, Mr. Terasaki, Chief of the Bureau of American Affairs, said
                            somewhat to the following effect: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Foreign Minister has already conveyed most fully to Your
                                    Excellency how eagerly the Japanese Government is now waiting
                                    for a reply from the American Government regarding the meeting
                                    of the responsible heads of the two Governments. I should like
                                    to inquire, though I am not specially instructed to do so today,
                                    if your Embassy has received any word from Washington.</p>
                                <p>I am submitting to Your Excellency a document which has been
                                    prepared along the lines of the American Draft Understanding of
                                    June 21, both in form and contents, and in which is incorporated
                                    all that we have since communicated to the American
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>This is not, of course, intended to be a rigid formula like a
                                    treaty. Its wording is not inflexible. It has been put in the
                                    present form only to make all matters clearer. Accordingly, this
                                    is by no means a new proposal but rather a document prepared for
                                    the convenience of the American Government.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It may be further added that, decoded and slightly edited at this
                            Embassy, the present text of the document may not agree exactly with the
                            one transmitted directly to the State Department from the American

                            <p>The Governments of Japan and of the United States accept joint
                                responsibility for the initiation and conclusion of a general
                                agreement of understanding as expressed in a joint declaration for
                                the resumption of traditional friendly relations.</p>
                            <p>Without reference to specific causes of recent estrangement, it is
                                the sincere desire of both Governments that the incidents which led
                                to the deterioration of the amicable sentiment between their
                                countries should be prevented from recurrence and corrected in their
                                unforeseen and unfortunate consequences.</p>
                            <p>It is the earnest hope of both Governments that, by a cooperative
                                effort, Japan and the United States may contribute effectively
                                toward the establishment and preservation of peace in the Pacific
                                area and, by the rapid consummation of an amicable understanding,
                                encourage world peace and arrest, if not dispel, the tragic
                                confusion that now threatens to engulf civilization.</p>
                            <p>For such decisive action, protracted negotiations would seem
                                ill-suited and weakening. Both Governments, therefore, desire that
                                adequate instrumentalities should be developed for the realization
                                of a general understanding which would bind, meanwhile, both
                                Governments in honor and in act.</p>
                            <p>It is the belief of both Governments that such an understanding
                                should comprise only the pivotal issues of urgency and not the
                                accessory concerns which could be deliberated later at a
                                conference.</p>
                            <p>Both Governments presume to anticipate that they could achieve
                                harmonious relations if certain situations and attitudes were
                                clarified or improved; to wit: <list>

                                a family, one household living under the ideal of universal concord
                                through justice and equity; each equally enjoying rights and
                                admitting responsibilities with a mutuality of interests regulated
                                by peaceful processes and directed to the pursuit of their moral and

                            <p>Both Governments are firmly determined that their respective

                                moral principles of social order and national life will continue to
                                be preserved and never transformed by foreign ideas or ideologies
                                contrary to those moral principles and concepts.</p>

                                <item>The uncertainty of China’s internal stability even in ordinary
                                    times is a fact proven by history. Far greater is the danger of
                                    disorders of various sorts following a war, and such disorders
                                    are apt to be attended by intrigues and maneuvers from external
                                    sources, producing friction between China and Japan or other
                                    foreign Powers. Thus has the internal instability of China
                                    frequently led to international conflict. It is well known how
                                    intense, and how detrimental to the maintenance of peace and
                                    order, are the activities of Communist elements in China today.

                                    question to stabilize China’s national life or to promote the
                                    welfare of the Chinese people. Accordingly, what is most needed
                                    upon the conclusion of peace between China and Japan is to
                                    ensure the maintenance of peace and order in China, which is
                                    desired in order that the Chinese Government may be enabled to
                                    concentrate its efforts toward a speedy achievement of the
                                    stabilization of China’s national life. While the Japanese
                                    Government would like to see this task undertaken by China
                                    alone, it realizes the actual difficulties in the present
                                    circumstances. Moreover, Japan has reasons of its own (2), which
                                    render imperative cooperation between the two countries. This is
                                    why Japan proposes the stationing of required armed forces for a
                                    necessary period in certain prescribed areas.</item>

                                <item>From the economic standpoint alone it is obvious that the
                                    conditions of peace and order in neighboring territories
                                    importantly affect the existence of Japan. It is even more
                                    obvious that the conditions of China after the restoration of
                                    peace, viewed from the military standpoint, such as prevail at
                                    the present time after four years of modern warfare on a
                                    gigantic scale, affect directly and vastly the existence of
                                    Japan. In these times when almost the entire world is engulfed
                                    in the turmoil of war, there is no telling what serious
                                    situations may arise in China through internal or external
                                    causes. In order to prevent such eventualities, that is to say,
                                    in order to safeguard the existence and defense of Japan itself,
                                    the Japanese Government is obliged to station armed forces in
                                    China.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>For the reasons stated above, stationing of armed forces is an
                                absolute necessity. However, the Japanese Government is prepared to
                                withdraw the armed forces whenever their presence is no longer
                                required. Any proposal such as that of maintaining peace by the
                                stationing of international armed forces is unacceptable because of
                                public opinion in Japan and also because of the direct and vital
                                bearing the internal conditions of China have upon Japan.</p>

                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs requested me to call upon him this
                            afternoon and for some two hours we discussed in broad outline and in
                            detail various aspects of relations between Japan and the United States.
                            Throughout Admiral Toyoda manifested his determination and desire to cut
                            through the maze of Japanese bureaucracy which has been and in a great
                            number of instances is still hindering the solution of certain problems.
                            In connection with the treatment of American nationals within the
                            Japanese Empire and Japanese-occupied areas the Minister’s obviously
                            sincere efforts have already proved <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642"
                                facs="0708"/>effective, and I am led to believe from his assurances
                            that the early future may show further progress in this direction.…</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda began the conversation by remarking that, today being the
                            anniversary of the conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance, he had had a
                            tiring day with a long program of attending functions and delivering
                            speeches, but he said that he had asked me to call this afternoon, in
                            order that he might present to me certain thoughts in an “off the
                            record” conversation, as he did not wish to lose any time in stressing
                            again the urgency of receiving with as little delay as possible the
                            reply of the American Government to the proposal put forward by the
                            Japanese Government for a meeting of the responsible leaders of the
                            United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda then asked whether I had received any information
                            indicative of the views and attitude of my Government with regard to the
                            proposal. I replied that I had not, but that the Secretary of State had
                            telegraphed me that he had conferred with Admiral Nomura on September
                            23, that Admiral Nomura had handed to the Secretary certain written
                            material, and that the Secretary had informed Admiral Nomura that he
                            would have the material examined as expeditiously as possible with a
                            view to making an early reply to the proposal of the Japanese
                            Government. Admiral Toyoda made the brief observation that he was
                            gratified to receive that information.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister’s main purpose in conversation with me today,
                            however, was to have conveyed to the President, through the Secretary of
                            State and myself, the anxiety of Prince Konoye and the entire Cabinet
                            lest the proposed meeting between the heads of our two Governments might
                            be indefinitely delayed, and orally to present various considerations
                            regarding the position of the Japanese Government in connection with the
                            present informal conversations, as follows.</p>

                                <item>The whole Atlantic area is engulfed in war and the European
                                    continent is in tumult. The Pacific area fortunately has not yet
                                    been touched by similar catastrophe. Whether or not the Pacific
                                    also is to become involved in the war is a question to which the
                                    United States and Japan hold the solution. Not only are the
                                    endeavors of Japan to adjust its relations with the United
                                    States directed against the spread of war into the Pacific, but
                                    also Japan is mindful of its desire for contributing toward the
                                    welfare of all mankind by the reestablishment of good relations
                                    between our two countries and by their cooperation for the
                                    restoration of world peace. The replacing of American-Japanese
                                    relations onto their traditional friendly basis has been the
                                    object of the Foreign Minister’s continuous thought and effort
                                    since his assumption of office some two months ago. Japan’s
                                    membership in the Tripartite Pact, however, is a consideration
                                    which renders susceptible to serious misunderstanding on the
                                    side of <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0709"/>Japan’s allies
                                    any approach which the Japanese Government might make to the
                                    United States, particularly so important an event as a meeting
                                    between the responsible heads of the Japanese and American
                                    Governments. However, in spite of this risk and in spite of the
                                    lack of precedent in Japanese history for a Prime Minister to go
                                    abroad to confer with the head of a foreign Government, Prince
                                    Konoye is nevertheless determined to meet with President
                                    Roosevelt. In thus seeking to adjust its relations with the
                                    United States, for the welfare of humanity as a whole as well as
                                    for the sake of the two countries directly concerned, Japan’s
                                    sincerity is evident.</item>

                                <item>Since there is by no means any thought in Japan that the
                                    sacrifice of everything by Japan is required for the maintenance
                                    of peace in the Pacific, it would be a most unfortunate
                                    conjecture for anyone to assume that Japan, despite its national
                                    characteristic of reacting strongly to outside influence, had
                                    surrendered to American pressure in making this approach to the
                                    United States, an approach which actually is prompted by Japan’s
                                    desire to contribute, toward the welfare of the whole world. The
                                    Minister was bringing up this point because of past suggestions
                                    to this effect appearing in American newspapers. At present,
                                    happily, this was not the case. Indeed, the Minister recalled
                                    that the Secretary of State had made mention in conversation
                                    with the Japanese Ambassador in Washington of the improvement in
                                    the tone of the Japanese press, an improvement which was in fact
                                    one of considerable degree.</item>

                                <item>Many problems must be solved in facing the question of the
                                    reestablishment of good relations between Japan and the United
                                    States. Nobody in Japan has any idea that a single meeting
                                    between the Prime Minister and the President will resolve these
                                    problems. Such readjustment will require time. But the political
                                    effects of the very meeting of the heads of Governments would be
                                    important. An epochal improvement in Japanese-American relations
                                    would evolve from the meeting which, although Admiral Toyoda is
                                    of the opinion that divergencies of attitude and policy have
                                    been eliminated, nevertheless would remove any differences still

                                    the position of the Japanese Government has been completely set

                                    along the lines of the American draft statement of June 21, was
                                    presented to the American Ambassador on September 25.<note

                                    been confidentially appointed and the ship to carry the party

                                    momentary readiness to sail. (Admiral Toyoda here remarked that
                                    Mr. Hull had mentioned to the Japanese Ambassador his fear that
                                    the Japanese Government might not be allowed by the Japanese
                                    Navy and Army to venture upon any course of peace. The Foreign
                                    Minister stated that in order to dissipate doubt as to the
                                    collaboration of the Japanese Navy and Army with the Prime
                                    Minister’s undertaking, high-ranking naval and military officers
                                    would accompany Prince Konoye.) A reply from the United States
                                    Government is being momentarily awaited. The first anniversary
                                    of the concluding of the Tripartite Pact chances to be
                                    celebrated today. A highly delicate situation is being created
                                    within Japan by opposition groups who, hoping that this very day
                                    might be a turning point in the history of Japan, are moving
                                    against the policy of the Cabinet in its endeavors to bring
                                    about an improvement in relations with the United States.</item>

                                    repeatedly stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is his
                                    belief that there is every reason to expedite the decision to
                                    hold the proposed meeting. He was glad to hear that Mr. Hull had
                                    told Admiral Nomura on September 23 that he would with good will
                                    and expediency study the papers given him by the Japanese
                                    Ambassador. The Foreign Minister would be very grateful to have
                                    from the American Government at its earliest convenience an
                                    explicit reply in which the place and date of the meeting would
                                    be indicated. It would be greatly appreciated by the Japanese
                                    Government if the American Government would be pleased to assign
                                    some date between October 10 and 15 for the meeting as the
                                    Japanese mission is ready to leave at any time.</item>

                                <item>Admiral Toyoda wanted to emphasize the essential necessity for
                                    mutual confidence and faith. He was aware that the American
                                    Ambassador well knew of the Prime Minister’s feelings, his
                                    character and past career, his faith and sincerity. Prince
                                    Konoye and the entire Cabinet are of the opinion that if
                                    advantage is not taken of the present favorable opportunity
                                    another equally propitious occasion could not be expected in the
                                    early future. Consummation of the proposed meeting, it was felt,
                                    was of the greatest importance.</item>
                                <label>10.</label>
                                <item>His statement concluded, the Minister remarked that he hoped
                                    nothing he had said would be construed as setting a time limit
                                    upon the reply awaited from the American Government or as
                                    indicating that there would not be given, if requested, further
                                    explanation of the position of the Japanese Government. Having
                                    regard, however, for the grave situations at present obtaining
                                    throughout the world as well as within Japan, the Minister
                                    declared an early consummation of the proposed meeting between
                                    the heads of the two Governments to be a matter of prime
                                    importance. Admiral Toyoda reiterated his hope that his
                                    statement would not be misinterpreted.</item>

                        <p>I informed the Foreign Minister that, although I had already communicated

                            completely and precisely as possible.</p>
                        <p>It may be significant that my appointment with Admiral Toyoda followed
                            almost immediately after the luncheon which he tendered today for the
                            Axis diplomats and at which he made a relatively innocuous speech
                            celebrating the anniversary of the Three Power Pact which was concluded
                            last year. Perhaps by this meeting with me he wished to emphasize to us
                            the fact that Japan’s membership in the Tripartite Pact would not be
                            allowed to obstruct a readjustment of Japanese-American relations, or he
                            may have desired to counteract any adverse effects which his speech
                            might have caused in the United States.</p>

                        <p>1529. The Ambassador reports for Secretary Hull and Under Secretary

                                <item>In regard to the preliminary conversations taking place at
                                    Washington and Tokyo, the Ambassador points out that a review of
                                    telegraphic correspondence on this subject since last spring
                                    reveals the Japanese Government’s efforts, increasing steadily
                                    and intensified lately, to arrange a meeting between Prince
                                    Konoye and President Roosevelt without further delay. While
                                    admitting his role to be chiefly that of a transmitting agent in
                                    these conversations, the Ambassador naturally wishes to aid in
                                    any constructive way, particularly by endeavoring to appraise
                                    accurately for the President and the Secretary of State the
                                    Japanese factors and conditions having direct or indirect
                                    bearing on the subject and also by trying to bring the Japanese
                                    Government to adopt measures and policies such as the United
                                    States Government deems to be essential for a mutual
                                    understanding or agreement between Japan and the United States.
                                    Since the fall of Admiral Yonai’s Cabinet in July of 1940,
                                    American diplomacy in Japan has been in eclipse temporarily
                                    through force of circumstances. However, when the Konoye-Toyoda
                                    regime began last July, American diplomacy obtained a very
                                    active new lease of life. The Ambassador expresses his earnest
                                    hope therefore that so propitious a period be not permitted to
                                    slip by without a new foundation having been laid with enough
                                    stability to warrant a reasonable <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646"
                                        facs="0712"/>amount of confidence that the structure to be
                                    erected gradually and progressively thereon can and will
                                    endure.</item>

                                <item>The Ambassador recalls his statements in the past that in
                                    Japan the pendulum always swings between moderate and extremist
                                    policies; that it was not then possible under the existing
                                    circumstances for any Japanese leader or group to reverse the
                                    program of expansion and expect to survive; that the permanent
                                    digging in by Japanese in China and the pushing of the Japanese
                                    advance to the south could be prevented only by insuperable
                                    obstacles. The Ambassador recalls likewise his views that the
                                    risks of taking positive measures to maintain United States
                                    security in the future were likely to be far smaller than the
                                    risks of not taking such measures; that only respect for
                                    potential power of the United States has deterred Japan from
                                    taking more liberties with American interests; and that Japan’s
                                    program of forcible expansion could be brought to a halt only by
                                    a show of force and by a demonstration of American willingness
                                    to use this force if necessary. The Ambassador recalls also his
                                    statement that if Japan’s leadership could be discredited
                                    eventually by such American action, there might take shape in
                                    Japan ultimately a regeneration of thought which would allow
                                    Japan to resume formal relations with the United States, leading
                                    to a readjustment of the entire problem of the Pacific.</item>

                                <item>The Ambassador suggests that the United States has been
                                    following very wisely precisely this policy which, furthered by
                                    other developments in the world, has helped to discredit
                                    Japanese leadership, notably that of former Foreign Minister
                                    Matsuoka. The Ambassador cites as world developments arousing a
                                    positive reaction from the United States the conclusion by Japan
                                    of the Tripartite Alliance and Japan’s recognition of the Wang
                                    Ching-wei regime at Nanking, which preceded Germany’s attack on
                                    the Soviet Union. Germany’s action upset the basis for the
                                    Tripartite Pact, Japan having joined the Italo-German Axis in
                                    order to obtain security against Russia and thereby to avoid the
                                    peril of being caught between the Soviet Union and the United
                                    States. At the present time Japan is attempting to correct this
                                    miscalculation by getting out of an extremely dangerous
                                    position. The Ambassador recalls his reports to the Department
                                    to the effect that Japanese foreign policies are inevitably
                                    changed by the impact of events abroad and that liberal elements
                                    in Japan might come to the top in due course as a result of the
                                    trend of events. He considers that such a time has arrived. He
                                    sees a good chance of Japan’s falling into line if a program can
                                    be followed of world reconstruction as forecast by the
                                    declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill.

                                    the United States to take positive measures when called for—plus
                                    the impact of world developments upon Japan, has rendered
                                    Japan’s political soil hospitable to the sowing of new seeds
                                    which, the Ambassador feels, if planted carefully and nourished,
                                    may bring about the anticipated regeneration of Japanese thought
                                    and a complete readjustment of relations between Japan and the

                                <item>Certain quarters have advanced the thought—and no doubt it is
                                    prominently in the mind of the United States Government—that at
                                    this juncture an agreement between Japan and the United States
                                    will serve merely as a breathing spell to Japan. During such a
                                    breathing spell, Japan, having successfully untangled itself
                                    with American aid from the China conflict, will recoup and
                                    strengthen its forces in order to resume at the next favorable
                                    opportunity its expansionist program. This thought cannot be
                                    gainsaid with certainty. The same school of thought also holds
                                    that Japan will be forced to relinquish its expansionist program
                                    because of the deterioration of Japanese domestic economy and
                                    because of the threat of financial, economic, and social
                                    collapse due to a progressive intensifying of economic measures
                                    by the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands against
                                    Japan. The Ambassador adds that should this thesis be accepted
                                    as reasonably sound, the position will confront the United
                                    States of choosing one of two methods to approach its objective,
                                    namely, either the method of progressive economic strangulation
                                    or the method of constructive conciliation, not so-called
                                    appeasement. The Ambassador sees the second method as the
                                    definite choice of the United States Government following the
                                    beginning of the Washington preliminary conversations and
                                    President Roosevelt’s acceptance in principle of the Japanese
                                    Prime Minister’s proposed meeting. Indeed, the Ambassador
                                    remarks, the United States has never departed from its readiness
                                    to negotiate on any issues with Japan (see the American note
                                    dated December 30, 1938<note n="25" xml:id="d356fn25"><ref

                                    that Japan already had embarked at that time on its expansion by
                                    force program. He feels that, from the viewpoint of farseeing
                                    statesmanship, the wisdom of the American choice seems to be
                                    beyond cavil. Should failure greet the constructive,
                                    conciliatory method of approach now or later, there will always
                                    be available the other method, the application of progressive
                                    economic sanctions. In the opinion of the Ambassador, whether
                                    the trend of American relations with Japan is for better or for
                                    worse, the United States obviously will have to remain for a
                                    longtime to come in a state of preparedness. The thought that
                                    eventual British victory in the world war will solve
                                    automatically many problems may, meanwhile, afford whatever
                                    degree of encouragement is justified.</item>

                                <item>The Ambassador, while admitting that risks will inevitably be
                                    involved no matter what course is pursued toward Japan, offers
                                    his carefully studied belief that there would be substantial
                                    hope at the very least of preventing the Far Eastern situation
                                    from becoming worse and perhaps of ensuring definitely
                                    constructive results, if an agreement along the lines of the
                                    preliminary discussions were brought to a head by the proposed
                                    meeting of the heads of the two Governments. The Ambassador
                                    mentions his previous expressions of opinion that the principal
                                    point at issue between the United States and Japan is not
                                    whether the former must call a halt to the expansionist program
                                    of the latter, but when. He raises the questions whether the
                                    United States is not now given the opportunity to halt Japan’s
                                    program without war, or an immediate risk of war, and further
                                    whether, through failure to use the present opportunity, the
                                    United States will not face a greatly increased risk of war. The
                                    Ambassador states his firm belief in an affirmative answer to
                                    these two questions.</item>

                                <item>Certain quarters hold the view that it is altogether
                                    improbable under existing circumstances that counteraction will
                                    be deliberately taken by Japan in response to any American
                                    action likely to be taken in the Pacific which would bring about
                                    war with the United States. The Ambassador states his inability
                                    to agree that war may not supervene following actions, whether
                                    irrational or deliberate, by elements either in Japan or in the
                                    United States tending so to inflame public opinion in the other
                                    country concerned as to make war unavoidable. He recalls in this

                                <item>The Ambassador stresses the importance of understanding
                                    Japanese psychology, fundamentally unlike that of any Western
                                    nation. Japanese reactions to any particular set of
                                    circumstances cannot be measured, nor can Japanese actions be
                                    predicted by any Western measuring rod. This fact is hardly
                                    surprising in the case of a country so recently feudalistic. The
                                    Ambassador conceives his chief duty to be an attempt to
                                    interpret accurately Japanese psychology, and he states that he
                                    has aimed to do this in his numerous reports during the last
                                    several months and years to the Department. Keeping this thought
                                    constantly before him, the Ambassador ventures at the risk of
                                    repetition to advance the considerations set forth below.</item>

                                <item>Should the United States expect or await agreement by the
                                    Japanese Government, in the present preliminary conversations,
                                    to clear-cut commitments which will satisfy the United States
                                    Government both as to principle and as to concrete detail,
                                    almost certainly the conversations will drag along indefinitely
                                    and unproductively until the Konoye Cabinet and its supporting
                                    elements desiring <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> with the
                                    United States will come to the conclusion that the outlook for
                                    an agreement is hopeless and that the United States Government
                                        <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0715"/>is only playing for
                                    time. If the abnormal sensitiveness of Japan and the abnormal
                                    effects of loss of face are considered, in such a situation
                                    Japanese reaction may and probably will be serious. This will
                                    result in the Konoye Government’s being discredited and in a
                                    revulsion of anti-American feeling, and this may and probably
                                    will lead to unbridled acts. The eventual cost of these will not
                                    be reckoned, and their nature is likely to inflame Americans,
                                    while reprisal and counter-reprisal measures will bring about a
                                    situation in which it will be difficult to avoid war. The
                                    logical outcome of this will be the downfall of the Konoye
                                    Cabinet and the formation of a military dictatorship which will
                                    lack either the disposition or the temperament to avoid
                                    colliding head-on with the United States. There is a question
                                    that such a situation may prove to be more serious even than the
                                    failure to produce an entirely satisfactory agreement through
                                    the proposed meeting between President Roosevelt and Prince
                                    Konoye, should it take place as planned. Worded otherwise, the
                                    question remains whether it will not prove to be a less serious
                                    case for the negotiations undertaken in good faith to fail of
                                    complete success than for the United States to demonstrate its

                                <item>The Ambassador continues by stating that he has been
                                    emphatically told on numerous occasions—and such declarations he
                                    considers must be accepted at their face value—that prior to the
                                    proposed Roosevelt-Konoye meeting and formal negotiations it is
                                    impossible for the Japanese Government to define its future
                                    assurances and commitments more specifically than hitherto
                                    stated. The Ambassador explains that one reason for this
                                    Japanese position, as given him very confidentially, is that
                                    former Foreign Minister Matsuoka, after his retirement in July,
                                    recounted in complete detail to the German Ambassador in Japan
                                    the course of the Washington conversations up to that time.
                                    Because many supporters of Matsuoka remain in the Tokyo Foreign
                                    Office, the fear has been expressed that these men will not
                                    scruple to reveal to both the Germans and the Japanese
                                    extremists any information which would render the present
                                    Cabinet’s position untenable. Although certain basic principles
                                    have been accepted provisionally by the Japanese Government, the
                                    definitions and formulae of Japan’s future objectives and
                                    policy, as advanced so far during the preliminary conversations,
                                    and the statements supplementary to those definitions, are so
                                    abstract or equivocal and are open to such wide interpretation
                                    that they rather create confusion than clarify commitments which
                                    the Japanese Government is ready to undertake. The Ambassador
                                    states that at the same time he has been told that Prince Konoye
                                    is in a position in direct negotiations with President Roosevelt
                                    to offer him assurances which, because of their far reaching <pb
                                        n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0716"/>character, will not
                                    fail to satisfy the United States. The truth of this statement
                                    cannot be determined by the Ambassador, who, however, points out
                                    that, in regard specifically to Japan’s Axis relations, the
                                    Japanese Government, though refusing consistently to give an
                                    undertaking that it will overtly renounce its alliance
                                    membership, actually has shown a readiness to reduce Japan’s
                                    alliance adherence to a dead letter by its indication of
                                    willingness to enter formally into negotiations with the United
                                    States. The Ambassador therefore does not consider unlikely the
                                    possibility of Prince Konoye’s being in a position to give
                                    President Roosevelt directly a more explicit and satisfactory
                                    engagement than has already been vouchsafed in the course of the
                                    preliminary conversations.</item>

                                <item>In the opinion of the Ambassador, on the basis of the above
                                    observations which he has every reason to regard as sound,
                                    American objectives will not be reached by insisting or
                                    continuing to insist during the preliminary conversations that
                                    Japan provide the sort of clear-cut, specific commitments which
                                    appear in any final, formal convention or treaty. Unless a
                                    reasonable amount of confidence is placed by the United States
                                    in the professed sincerity of intention and good faith of Prince
                                    Konoye and his supporters to mould Japan’s future policy upon
                                    the basic principles they are ready to accept and then to adopt
                                    measures which gradually but loyally implement those principles,
                                    with it understood that the United States will implement its own
                                    commitments <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the steps
                                    which Japan takes, the Ambassador does not believe that a new
                                    orientation can be successfully created in Japan to lead to a
                                    general improving of Japanese-American relations and to the hope
                                    that ultimate war may be avoided in the Pacific. The sole way to
                                    discredit the Japanese military machine and army is through
                                    wholesale military defeat, and the Ambassador sees no present
                                    prospect of this. The only alternative (and the only wise one in
                                    the view of the Ambassador) is an attempt to produce a
                                    regeneration of Japanese thought and outlook through
                                    constructive conciliation, along the lines of American efforts
                                    at present. The Ambassador inquires whether the better part of
                                    wisdom and of statesmanship is not to bring such efforts to a
                                    head before the force of their initial impetus is lost, leaving
                                    it impossible to overcome an opposition which the Ambassador
                                    thinks will mount inevitably and steadily in Japan.</item>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                            apartment. He handed the Secretary a document (copy of which is attached
                                hereto)<note n="26" xml:id="d357fn26"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Infra</hi>.</note> containing the gist of what the Foreign Minister
                            said in his conversations with the American Ambassador at Tokyo on
                            September 27.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said with an apparent touch of embarrassment that he was
                            very well aware of the attitude of this Government and had made this
                            Government’s position very clear to his own Government, and that
                            notwithstanding this his Government had instructed him to press for an
                            answer on the Japanese Government’s proposal. The Ambassador added that
                            he had been asked by his Government to seek a further meeting with the
                            President, but that the Ambassador realized the situation here and that
                            was why he was laying the matter before the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that, as the Ambassador knew, the President’s
                            brother-in-law had died last week, that the President went to Hyde Park
                            over the weekend, and that consequently the Secretary had not been able
                            to see the President for the last three or four days. The Secretary
                            said, however, that he expected to see the President today. The
                            Secretary went on to say that he expected to be able to give the
                            Ambassador within two or three days a memorandum having a bearing upon
                            the Japanese Government’s proposal. The Secretary pointed out that just
                            as the Japanese Government had its difficulties we had our difficulties,
                            that the whole effort of our conversations had been to narrow the gap
                            between our respective views, and that we had felt that time was
                            necessary in order to enable the Japanese Government to educate its
                            public opinion to accept a broad-gauge program such as we advocated.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that he himself was in favor of a broad-gauge
                            program, but that he knew very well the psychology within the Japanese
                            Army. He said that even the highest-ranking generals had a simplicity of
                            mind which made it difficult for them to see why, as they saw the
                            situation, when the United States should be asserting leadership on the
                            American continent with the Monroe Doctrine the United States should
                            want to interfere with Japan’s assuming leadership on the Asiatic
                            continent. The Secretary asked why the Japanese Government could not
                            educate the generals. The Ambassador replied that this would take twenty
                            years.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0718"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether the Japanese public as a whole desired a
                            speedy settlement of the conflict with China. The Ambassador replied
                            that for the last two or three years the Japanese public desired such a
                            settlement but felt that under existing circumstances they had no
                            alternative to continuing fighting. The Secretary observed that there
                            have been a number of our marine guards who did not want to leave China
                            and he supposed that in the case of the Japanese occupationary forces
                            there were many who would not like to be recalled. The Ambassador
                            laughed and replied that this was quite true, and he observed that when
                            an Army general in China was clothed with the authority of a viceroy,
                            naturally he did not welcome the prospect of being shorn of that
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, in reply to a further question by the Secretary, stated
                            that he believed that the Japanese Government was in a stronger position
                            internally than it had been, but that, nevertheless, in his own personal
                            opinion, he judged that if nothing came of the proposal for a meeting
                            between the chiefs of our two Governments it might be difficult for
                            Prince Konoye to retain his position and that Prince Konoye then would
                            be likely to be succeeded by a less moderate leader. He suggested that
                            this was one reason why the Japanese Government desired to move as
                            speedily as possible. The Secretary repeated that we would expect to
                            communicate with the Japanese Ambassador in two or three days.</p>

                        <p>1. The war in Europe, involving many major Powers, has spread to the
                            Atlantic. Fortunately, it has not yet touched the Pacific Ocean, where
                            the key to peace or war lies in the hands of Japan and the United
                            States. Should these two countries go to war, it would mean the
                            destruction of world civilization and a dire calamity to mankind.</p>
                        <p>In recent times various events have occurred in rapid succession, tending
                            to destroy the friendly relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>An adjustment of Japanese-American relations at this time and the
                            enhancement of the friendship of the two countries will redound <pb
                                n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0719"/>not only to the benefit of
                            Japan and America but also to the cause of world peace. The Japanese
                            Government seeks such adjustment not solely for the sake of the two
                            countries but also for the purpose of paving the way for a general
                            peaceful settlement throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>2. For the past two months since my appointment as Foreign Minister I
                            have striven night and day toward obtaining an amicable settlement
                            between Japan and America. It is also with the same purpose in view that
                            Prince Konoye himself has decided to come to the front and proposed a
                            meeting with President Roosevelt.</p>
                        <p>3. Japan is bound in alliance with Germany and Italy. The very idea that
                            the Head of my Government should meet the President of the United States
                            is liable to give rise to misunderstandings regarding Japan’s ties with
                            those two countries. Such a step would entail really a great sacrifice
                            on the part of the Japanese Government. Moreover, from Japan’s domestic
                            standpoint, it will be an event unprecedented in history for the Prime
                            Minister to go out of the country on a diplomatic mission. This fact
                            alone should be a sufficient testimony to the sincerity of the Japanese
                            Government in its desire for an adjustment of Japanese-American
                            relations and for the preservation of peace in the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>4. If there are those who would interpret Japan’s attitude as an
                            indication not of her solicitude for peace but of her submission to
                            American pressure, they are grossly mistaken. Eager as we are for peace,
                            we will not bow under the pressure of another country, nor do we want
                            peace at any price. It is a characteristic trait of our people to repel,
                            rather than to submit to, external pressure. I repeat this point in view
                            of certain comments that have appeared in American newspapers, although
                            I am told they are showing nowadays signs of moderation.</p>
                        <p>5. Japanese-American relations are so complex and complicated that they
                            are not capable of being adjusted at one stroke. The proposed meeting of
                            the heads of the two Governments may not succeed in effecting a general
                            solution of all difficulties. However, this meeting is bound to have a
                            vast political significance. Moreover, it is certain that at least those
                            problems yet to be settled (assuming that there will remain such
                            problems) that had been the subject of our negotiations by cable will be
                            readily solved at the conference. It will mark an epochal turn for good
                            in Japanese-American relations. The American Government has already
                            agreed in principle to the proposed meeting between Prince Konoye and
                            President Roosevelt. Should it fail to take place there will never be
                            another opportunity combined with such an auspicious setting for such a
                                <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0720"/>conference. Besides, the
                            repercussions of the failure might be most unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>6. The policy and aims of my Government have been fully communicated to
                            the American Government. A resumé of these, put in the form of the
                            American Draft Understanding of June 21, 1941, has also been submitted
                            to Your Excellency. I trust that the views of my Government are being
                            given careful consideration by the American Government.</p>
                        <p>7. On our side, the ship to carry the Prime Minister is ready. The
                            members of his suite including a full General and a full Admiral have
                            been privately appointed. The party is prepared to depart at any
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>8. In the circumstances such as I have described, the Japanese Government
                            is now anxiously looking forward to receiving a reply from the American
                            Government at the earliest date possible. As I have spoken to Your
                            Excellency at our last meeting, any further delay—especially after
                            today’s anniversary of the Tripartite Pact—would put my Government in a
                            very delicate position.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the climatic conditions in the Northern Pacific and the
                            vicinity of the Alaskan coast are likely to become unfavorable for the
                            proposed meeting.</p>
                        <p>9. Time, as I have often said, is a vital factor from both internal and
                            international viewpoints. The decision must be made as soon as possible.
                            So I desire to ask for the most speedy and sincere consideration of the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <p>I may add that, as regards the date for the meeting, October 10–15 will
                            suit the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Finally, by way of a conclusion, I should like to say that negotiations
                            of this sort require sincerity and mutual confidence. I need not dwell
                            on the character, the convictions and faith of Prince Konoye as well as
                            his political position, all of which are well known to Your Excellency.
                            Without Prince Konoye and the present Cabinet under him, an opportunity
                            for Japanese-American <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> is likely to
                            be lost for some time to come. I wish to emphasize again the urgent
                            necessity of having the proposed meeting at the earliest possible
                            date.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called at the Secretary’s apartment at the request of the
                            Secretary. The Secretary handed the Ambassador a strictly confidential
                                <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0721"/>statement<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d359fn27"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> containing
                            the views of this Government with respect to the Japanese Government’s
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>After the Ambassador had read the statement the Secretary invited the
                            Japanese Ambassador to comment. The Ambassador said that he feared that
                            his Government would be disappointed because of its very earnest desire
                            to hold the meeting. He said he wished to assure the Secretary that he
                            was convinced that the Japanese Government was entirely sincere in this
                            matter and had no ulterior purpose. He added, however, that in view of
                            the difficulties of the internal situation in Japan he did not think his
                            Government could go further at this time. The Secretary replied that he
                            was fully convinced of the sincerity of the Prime Minister and others in
                            the Japanese Government. He said that so far as this Government was
                            concerned we had our difficulties, too; that we had to meet the
                            objections of critics; and that in view of past developments it was not
                            possible in one day to remove their misgivings. For this reason, as the
                            Secretary had often remarked, we felt it necessary to have an agreement
                            that would speak for itself: one that would on the face of it make
                            manifest the purposes of both Governments consistently to pursue courses
                            of peace. The Ambassador referred to a press report that he had seen
                            yesterday of a speech by a member of the American Cabinet in which there
                            was a reference to bringing about the defeat of Japan. His comment
                            implied that such statements would have a bad effect in Japan as it
                            would be assumed that what a member of the Cabinet said represented the
                            views of the administration. He said that certain persons in Japan might
                            have made unfortunate statements, but he did not think that such persons
                            were members of the Cabinet and that anything a member of the Japanese
                            Cabinet might say would be taken as representing the views of the
                            Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the fact that all the time the Ambassador and
                            he were holding conversations in regard to our proposed understanding
                            Mr. Matsuoka was making public statements of a character inconsistent
                            with the spirit of those conversations. He noted that the Ambassador had
                            continued their conversations despite those statements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that we had felt that we could not proceed
                            through indirect courses to attain the objects which our two Governments
                            are seeking, that we must proceed directly, and that no patchwork
                            arrangement would meet the situation of establishing peace in the
                            Pacific area. It was for that reason the Secretary felt that we should
                            endeavor to reach a meeting of minds on essential points before holding
                            the proposed meeting. We had no desire whatever, he emphasized, to cause
                            any delay. The Secretary further pointed out that we had tried the
                            effects of both secrecy and of publicity <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656"
                                facs="0722"/>and that we already were able to gauge public reaction
                            to the proposed understanding between the two Governments as a result of
                            our letting it be known that informal and exploratory conversations were
                            proceeding. Thus the important thing for us now was to endeavor to reach
                            a meeting of minds on essentials in order to insure the success of any
                            meeting that we might hold.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador did not appear to understand the foregoing point made
                            to him, Mr. Ballantine repeated in Japanese what the Secretary had
                            said.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he felt that the only point on which he
                            anticipated difficulty in the two Governments reaching an agreement was
                            in regard to the question of retention of Japanese troops in China. He
                            thought that, with regard to the question of non-discrimination, the
                            Japanese Government would meet us. The Secretary emphasized that in his
                            opinion no country would stand to gain more than Japan from the general
                            universal application of this principle. The Secretary added that he
                            would like to give the Ambassador a report of the Lima Conference
                            containing the resolutions adopted in regard to economic matters and he
                            suggested that the Japanese Government might be interested in adopting
                            similar policies in the Far East. The Ambassador said that Japanese
                            present-day thought with respect to regional economic blocs was the
                            result of circumstances, that is to say, of measures taken by other
                            countries such as the Empire preferences introduced at Ottawa. The
                            Secretary replied that he had been fighting such measures as those taken
                            at Ottawa and he would like to have Japan join with the United States in
                            fighting for liberal economic policies.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Ambassador commented that he thought that the Konoye
                            Cabinet was in a comparatively strong position and that he did not
                            anticipate that there was a likelihood of reactionary groups coining
                            into power. He repeated his conviction that the Konoye Cabinet was
                            extremely desirous of reaching an agreement with the United States.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the proposals of the Japanese Government
                            communicated on September 6, 1941, by the Japanese Ambassador to the

                        <p>Thoughtful study has been given to the communications to which reference
                            is made, and in connection with that study careful review has been made
                            of other communications previously received from the Japanese Government
                            on the same subject. On the basis of this study observations are offered
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States welcomed, as affording a possible
                            opportunity for furthering the broad-gauge objectives and principles of
                            a program of peace, the Japanese Government’s suggestions made through
                            its Ambassador here in the early part of August that there be held a
                            meeting of the responsible heads of the Japanese Government and of the
                            Government of the United States to discuss means for bringing about an
                            adjustment of relations between the United States and Japan and that
                            there be resumed the informal conversations which had been in progress
                            between the two countries to ascertain whether there existed a basis for
                            negotiations relative to a peaceful settlement covering the entire
                            Pacific situation.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in the reply made by the President on August 17, 1941, to
                            the Japanese Ambassador the view was expressed that such informal
                            conversations would naturally envisage the working out of a progressive
                            program attainable by peaceful means; that such a program would involve
                            the application in the entire Pacific area of the principle of equality
                            of commercial opportunity and treatment, thus making possible access by
                            all countries to raw materials and to all other essential commodities,
                            and there were described the advantages which would flow to all
                            countries, including Japan, from the adoption of such a program. In
                            conclusion, it was stated that if the Japanese Government were in
                            position to embark upon a peaceful program for the Pacific along the
                            lines of the program and principles to which the United States is
                            committed, this Government would be prepared to consider resumption of
                            the informal exploratory discussions and would be glad to endeavor to
                            arrange a suitable time and place to exchange views.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the broad purposes and fundamental principles which this
                            Government holds, it was gratifying to the President and the Government
                            of the United States to receive the message of the Prime Minister and
                            the statement of the Government of Japan on August 28, 1941, containing
                            statements expressing Japan’s desire and intent to pursue courses of
                            peace in harmony with the fundamental principles to which the people and
                            Government of the United States are committed. In its statement the
                            Japanese Government gave, with some qualifications, broad assurances of
                            its peaceful intent, including a comprehensive assurance that the
                            Japanese Government has no intention of using without provocation
                            military force against any neighboring nation. The Japanese Government
                            declared <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0724"/>that it supported the
                            program and principles which had been briefly outlined by the President
                            not only as applicable to the Pacific area but also as a program for the
                            entire world.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States, while desiring to proceed as rapidly
                            as possible with consideration of arrangements for a meeting between the
                            heads of state, felt it desirable, in order to assure that that meeting
                            would accomplish the objectives in view, to clarify the interpretation
                            of certain principles and the practical application thereof to concrete
                            problems in the Pacific area. It has not been the purpose of this
                            Government to enter into a discussion of details; this Government has
                            felt, however, that the clarification sought would afford a means of
                            expediting our effort to arrive at a meeting of minds.</p>
                        <p>On September 3, 1941, the President in giving reply to the Japanese
                            Ambassador expressed the earnest desire of the Government of the United
                            States to collaborate in efforts to make effective in practice the
                            principles to which the Japanese Government made reference. The
                            President reiterated the four principles regarded by this Government as
                            the foundation upon which relations between nations should properly
                            rest. Those principles are: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Respect for the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of
                                    each and all nations.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Support of the principle of non-interference in the internal
                                    affairs of other countries.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Support of the principle of equality, including equality of
                                    commercial opportunity.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Non-disturbance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in
                                    the Pacific except as the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> may
                                    be altered by peaceful means.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that in order to bring about any satisfactory
                            settlement of Pacific questions it was highly important to reach a
                            community of view and a clear agreement upon certain points with respect
                            to which fundamental differences of opinion between our two Governments
                            had developed in the informal conversations; and the President requested
                            an indication of the present attitude of the Japanese Government with
                            regard to those fundamental questions.</p>
                        <p>On September 6, the Prime Minister of Japan in a conversation with the
                            American Ambassador at Tokyo stated that he subscribed fully to the four
                            principles above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing developments and assurances, together with other statements
                            made by the Japanese Government, seemed to justify this Government in
                            concluding that the Japanese Government might be expected to adhere to
                            and to give practical application to a broad progressive program
                            covering the entire Pacific area. It was therefore <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0725"/>a source of disappointment to the
                            Government of the United States that the proposals of the Japanese
                            Government presented by the Japanese Ambassador on September 6, 1941,
                            which the Japanese Government apparently intended should constitute a
                            concrete basis for discussions, appeared to disclose divergence in the
                            concepts of the two Governments. That is to say, those proposals and the
                            subsequent explanatory statements made in regard thereto serve, in the
                            opinion of this Government, to narrow and restrict not only the
                            application of the principles upon which our informal conversations
                            already referred to had been based but also the various assurances given
                            by the Japanese Government of its desire to move along with the United
                            States in putting into operation a broad program looking to the
                            establishment and maintenance of peace and stability in the entire
                            Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>As has already been said, the various broad assurances given by the
                            Japanese Premier and the Japanese Government are highly gratifying. In
                            putting forward its attitude of peaceful intent toward other nations,
                            the Japanese Government qualified its assurances with certain phrases
                            the need for which is not easily understood. It is difficult to conceive
                            of there developing under present circumstances in any of the
                            territories neighboring French Indochina, in Thailand or in the Soviet
                            Union any aggressive threat or provocation to Japan. The inalienable
                            right of self-defense is of course well recognized by all nations and
                            there could arise in some minds a question as to just what the Japanese
                            Government has in view in circumscribing its assurances of peaceful
                            intent with what would seem to be unnecessary qualifying phrases.</p>
                        <p>In the informal conversations there was tentatively arrived at a formula
                            in regard to economic policy (Section V of the draft understanding),
                            which provided that Japanese activity and American activity in the
                            Pacific area shall be carried on by peaceful means and in conformity
                            with the principle of non-discrimination in international commercial
                            relations. In the Japanese Government’s proposals of September 6 and in
                            subsequent communications from the Japanese Government the commitments
                            contained in that formula were restricted to the countries of the
                            Southwest Pacific area (not the Pacific area as a whole). In reference
                            to China, the Japanese Government states that it will respect the
                            principle of non-discrimination, but the explanation given in regard to
                            this point would seem to be open to the implication that the Japanese
                            Government has in mind some limitation upon the application of this
                            principle occasioned by reasons of Japan’s geographical propinquity to
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, it would not be likely to serve the purposes affirmed by the
                            Japanese Government or by this Government if either the United <pb
                                n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0726"/>States or Japan were to pursue
                            one course or policy in certain areas while at the same time pursuing an
                            opposite course or policy in other areas.</p>
                        <p>This Government has noted the views of the Japanese Government in support
                            of its desire to station troops for an indeterminate period in certain
                            areas of China. Entirely apart from the question of the reasons for such
                            a proposal, the inclusion of such a provision in the proposed terms of a
                            peaceful settlement between Japan and China at a time when Japan is in
                            military occupation of large areas in China is open to certain
                            objections. For example, when a country in military occupation of
                            territory of another country proposes to the second country the
                            continued stationing of troops of the first country in certain areas as
                            a condition for a peaceful settlement and thus for the withdrawal of the
                            occupationary forces from other areas, such procedure would seem to be
                            out of keeping with the progressive and enlightened courses and
                            principles which were discussed in the informal conversations and thus
                            would not, in the opinion of this Government, make for peace or offer
                            prospects of stability.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a clear-cut manifestation of Japan’s intention in
                            regard to the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and French
                            Indochina would be most helpful in making known—in particular to those
                            who might be inclined to be critical—Japan’s peaceful intentions and
                            Japan’s desire to follow courses calculated to establish a sound basis
                            for future stability and progress in the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the attitude of each country toward the European war,
                            this Government has noted with appreciation the further step taken by
                            the Japanese Government to meet the difficulties inherent in this aspect
                            of the relations between the two countries. It is believed that it would
                            be helpful if the Japanese Government could give further study to the
                            question of possible additional clarification of its position.</p>
                        <p>In the exchanges of views which have taken place between the two
                            Governments in an effort to reach an agreement in principle upon
                            fundamental questions in order to prepare the ground for the proposed
                            meeting of the responsible chiefs of government, this Government has
                            endeavored to make clear that what it envisages is a comprehensive
                            program calling for the application uniformly to the entire Pacific area
                            of liberal and progressive principles. From what the Japanese Government
                            has so far indicated in regard to its purposes this Government derives
                            the impression that the Japanese Government has in mind a program which
                            would be circumscribed by the imposition of qualifications and
                            exceptions to the actual application of those principles.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0727"/>
                        <p>If this impression is correct, can the Japanese Government feel that a
                            meeting between the responsible heads of government under such
                            circumstances would be likely to contribute to the advancement of the
                            high purposes which we have mutually had in mind?</p>
                        <p>As already stated, this Government welcomed the assurances contained in
                            the statement of the Japanese Government which accompanied the Japanese
                            Prime Minister’s message to the President of the United States that the
                            Japanese Government subscribed to the principles which have long been
                            advocated by this Government as the only sound basis for stable
                            international relations. This Government believes that renewed
                            consideration of these fundamental principles may be helpful in our
                            effort to seek a meeting of minds in regard to the essential questions
                            on which we seek agreement and thus lay a firm foundation for a meeting
                            between the responsible heads of the two Governments. The subject of the
                            meeting proposed by the Prime Minister and the objectives sought have
                            engaged, and continue to engage, the close and active interest of the
                            President of the United States, and it is the President’s earnest hope
                            that discussion of the fundamental questions may be so developed that
                            such a meeting can be held. It is also the President’s hope that the
                            Japanese Government shares the conviction of this Government that, if
                            the Governments of Japan and of the United States are resolved to give
                            those principles practical and comprehensive application, the two
                            Governments can work out a fundamental rehabilitation of the relations
                            between the United States and Japan and contribute to the bringing about
                            of a lasting peace with justice, equity and order in the whole Pacific
                            area.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request and after having taken up

                        <p>In reply to a request by telephone yesterday from Mr. Ushiba, I suggested
                            that he breakfast with me this morning at my house. Mr. Ushiba arrived
                            promptly at the appointed time. Owing to the presence of the servant
                            during the meal, that part of our conversation which needs to be
                            recorded was brief and was substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba said that the Prime Minister’s position had been made
                            difficult by the failure of the preliminary conversations with the
                            United States to make any progress. Prince Konoye was at a loss to know
                            what further he could do, the opposition had now something concrete to
                            use in their attacks on the Cabinet, and the future looked dark. He said
                            that, unless we fully appreciated the circumstances in which his chief
                            had assumed responsibility for initiating these conversations, we would
                            not be able to understand the full implications of the situation. The
                            Army was anxious to bring the conflict with China to an end but it would
                            never take the responsibility for initiating a liquidation of the
                            conflict. When Prince Konoye had taken that responsibility, the Army
                            gave him full and unqualified support, and if his high hopes are not
                            fulfilled he will have to “assume responsibility”, and there would be no
                            one who would have the courage to take the risks which the Prince has
                            taken or with sufficient prestige and political position to gain the
                            support of the Army in any undertaking so vital to the nation as
                            settlement of the China conflict by process of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba went on to say that pessimism in Japanese official quarters
                            had been strengthened by failure on the part of the American Government
                            to lay any of its cards on the table. It was true that the American
                            Government had given a full presentation of its principles, but it had
                            not precisely specified what it wanted the Japanese Government to
                            undertake. Although several months had elapsed since the conversations
                            began, the apparently great care being taken by the American Government
                            not to give the Japanese any specifications was extremely discouraging.
                            Since the receipt of the last American memorandum (October 2) an
                            increasing number of persons in Japanese Government circles were of the
                            opinion that Japan had fallen into a trap, the argument running somewhat
                            as follows—the United States never had any intention of coming to any
                            agreement with Japan; it has now got from Japan an exposition of
                            Japanese policies and objectives; those policies and objectives are not
                            in line with American policies and objectives; and there is therefore
                            justification for refusing to make an agreement with Japan and for
                            continuing to maintain an attitude of quasi-hostility against Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0729"/>
                        <p>I told Mr. Ushiba that there was no basis for any such conjecture. I
                            recalled that the memorandum of October 2 referred to the reaction of
                            the American public to reports that conversations with Japan were taking
                            place and that the statement was made that, although the American
                            Government was no less eager than the Japanese Government to have
                            brought about settlement of Pacific problems, public opinion in the
                            United States was such as to render necessary a meeting of minds on
                            certain fundamental points prior to the opening of formal
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba asked whether we had received the actual text of the
                            memorandum. The summary (which I had allowed him to read on October 4)
                            shown to him by me was business like and objective in tone, but the
                            actual memorandum was, he said, “extremely disagreeable”. It was
                            argumentative and preceptive, it was quite uncompromising, and it
                            contained no suggestion or indication calculated to be helpful to, the
                            Japanese Government toward meeting the desires of the American
                            Government. Citing the reference to attitudes toward the European war,
                            he put the rhetorical question, Why was there not provided some
                            indication of the kind of undertaking the Japanese Government was
                            expected to give?</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Mr. Ushiba expressed the thought that the only thing left
                            for the Japanese Government was to ask the American Government to give
                            specifications with regard to the character of the undertakings which
                            Japan was desired to give, and that if a clear-cut reply was not
                            forthcoming to bring the conversations to an end.</p>

                        <p>When I called upon the Foreign Minister at his request this morning he
                            first informed me that the text of the memorandum handed to the Japanese
                            Ambassador on October 2 by the Secretary of State had been received and
                            was being carefully studied. In reply to the Minister’s question whether
                            I could make any comments on the memorandum I said that until I had had
                            an opportunity to study the full text, the Embassy having received a
                            resume only, I would prefer to make no observations.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda then told me that he was informed of my private meeting
                            with the Prime Minister on September 6 and was aware that I had
                            communicated to President Roosevelt through the Secretary of State, as a
                            “personal and private message”, the substance of Prince <pb n="664"
                                xml:id="pg_664" facs="0730"/>Konoye’s statements to me at that
                            meeting. The Foreign Minister said he wanted me clearly to understand
                            that he harbored no objection to my contact with Prince Konoye; rather
                            he was desirous that by such meetings between the Prime Minister and
                            myself a helpful exchange of views might be effected. Admiral Toyoda
                            stated that the private records of the Prime Minister with regard to the
                            September 6 meeting revealed that, although Prince Konoye had “in
                            principle” accepted the four points which the Secretary of State had
                            continuously stressed, the Prime Minister had indicated that some
                            adjustment would be required in the matter of applying the four points
                            to actual conditions. However, a statement that the Prime Minister
                            “fully subscribed” to the four points was contained in the memorandum
                            given to the Japanese Ambassador on October 2. Admiral Nomura had
                            therefore, in view of this disparity in the records, been instructed to
                            inform the Secretary of State that the phrase “in principle” should
                            replace the words “fully subscribed” in attributing to the Prime
                            Minister the statement, which had been made privately.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister declared that the statements made to me by the Prime
                            Minister on September 6 were of a purely private and informal nature and
                            were intended merely to acquaint me with the personal views of an
                            individual who held an important position in the moulding of the
                            decisions and policies of the Government of Japan. The thought of
                            authorizing me to communicate the substance of his observations as a
                            personal message to the President had only occurred to Prince Konoye
                            during the course of our meeting. Accordingly there had been no
                            expectation, said Admiral Toyoda, that there would be incorporated into
                            a public document, which had to be circulated among various Japanese
                            Government officials who had no knowledge of my meeting with Prince
                            Konoye, any statement made to me by the Prime Minister under these
                            circumstances. Thus, since an attribution of views to the Prime Minister
                            had appeared in an official document of the United States Government, it
                            had been deemed necessary, in view of the absence of previous comparison
                            between the Foreign Minister and myself of notes relating to what might
                            have been stated by Prince Konoye at the time of his meeting with me on
                            September 6, to clarify the Japanese record of the Prime Minister’s
                            statement. (There is no doubt whatsoever that the observations of the
                            Prime Minister, which were made in Japanese and translated by Dooman to
                            me, were correctly and accurately set forth in my telegram No. 1413,
                            September 6, 10 p.m.,<note n="28" xml:id="d363fn28">Not printed; see
                                memorandum of September 6, 1941, <ref target="#pg_604">p.

                            Minister doubtless is referring to his remark made subsequently that “he
                            is convinced that divergences of view can be satisfactorily met” and <pb
                                n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0731"/>that he “realizes that certain
                            points may require elucidation and precision”.)</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda stated at this point that he hoped to be able to comment
                            following the completion of his examination of the Secretary’s
                            memorandum of October 2, and in the meantime he felt that it would be
                            helpful if discussion of items arising from what he termed “technical
                            procedure” could be avoided. He had in mind such differences of
                            understanding as that relating to Prince Konoye’s statement of September
                            6, and to certain material delivered to the Department by the Japanese
                            Ambassador which either had no official standing or was incomplete as in
                            the case of the Ambassador’s draft statement of September 4. Admiral
                            Toyoda believed that any efforts to clear up details of this character
                            arising out of questions of technical procedure would only tend to
                            complicate the discussions, but once some real progress had been made he
                            would be prepared to take up such questions. The Foreign Minister said
                            that in so far as the Secretary’s memorandum of October 2 was concerned,
                            he would like to make one brief comment, namely, that it was his
                            impression that the Government of the United States wished the Japanese
                            Government to revert at once and unqualifiedly to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >status quo</hi> which prevailed four years ago. Since that time
                            Japan had been involved in warfare on a large-scale demanding hardships
                            and sacrifices of the people of Japan who had been led to support such
                            trials as a patriotic duty. The Japanese Government was willing and
                            prepared to return to the situation prevailing four years ago but it was
                            essential that the Government of the United States should understand
                            that to undo virtually at a moment’s notice the work of the past four
                            years is an undertaking of tremendous scope and one entailing basic
                            adjustments.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Toyoda then inquired whether unofficially and privately I felt
                            able to offer an opinion on the position of the United States Government
                            as outlined in the Secretary’s memorandum of October 2. In reply I told
                            him that it was the desire of the United States Government to establish
                            conditions in the Far East on a sure and enduring foundation and that no
                            lasting arrangements could be made except on such a basis. I told him
                            that my personal reaction to the Secretary’s memorandum of October 2 was
                            that the American Government was endeavoring to assure itself that Japan
                            would genuinely and fully observe those principles without which no sure
                            basis for a lasting peace in the Pacific area could be achieved.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Terasaki, Chief of the American Bureau of the Foreign Office, called
                            on me this afternoon, at his request, and asked if I had read the full
                            text of the Department’s memorandum of October 2 which he had lent us
                            for perusal. I replied in the affirmative. Mr. Terasaki then asked if I
                            would tell him in an entirely personal way and off the record my
                            impressions of the memorandum. I said that I thought the memorandum was
                            friendly in tone and helpful in substance and that it indicated a clear
                            desire on the part of our Government to make progress in the
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki then asked what particular points impressed me in connection
                            with the desires of the United States for action by Japan in order to
                            reach a mutual agreement. I replied that without having the actual
                            document before me I could not undertake to cover all the points
                            presented, but that personally and off the record I might say that three
                            of the points which had particularly caught my eye were (1) the
                            withdrawal of Japanese troops from China; (2) application to the entire
                            area of the Pacific of certain of the Japanese assurances which appeared
                            to be limited to the southwestern Pacific and (3) the special privileges
                            claimed by Japan as a result of her geographical propinquity to China.
                            In connection with the third point mentioned above I took the occasion
                            to say that many prominent Japanese were comparing our Monroe Doctrine
                            and our relationship to the countries of Latin America with Japan’s
                            position in the Far East and her relationship with the neighboring
                            countries, and I wished to say that in my opinion there was no more
                            comparison between these two situations than between black and white.
                            Mr. Terasaki said that he was obliged to disagree with me and we did not
                            pursue that subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki then pointed out that the withdrawal of Japanese troops from
                            China and Indochina must necessarily take time as it could not
                            physically be done all at once and he wanted to know my opinion as to
                            whether our Government intended to insist on the actual departure of all
                            Japanese troops from China and Indochina before the proposed meeting of
                            the President and the Prime Minister could be held and in this
                            connection he asked my interpretation of the Department’s phrase
                            “manifest intention”. I replied that I was not in a position to
                            interpret the phrase under reference except to say that in my personal
                            opinion the Department desired concrete evidence that these troops would
                            be withdrawn. In the conversations it had developed that it was the
                            desire of the Japanese Government to leave troops for a stated period in
                            North China, Mongolia and possibly other <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667"
                                facs="0733"/>areas and I pointed out to Mr. Terasaki the unfortunate
                            experiences which we had met in times past through the failure of
                            various Japanese Governments to carry out assurances given us in
                            apparent good faith. It therefore seemed to me obvious and reasonable
                            that my Government should seek concrete evidence of the Japanese
                            Government’s “manifest intention”, and this would be my personal, off
                            the record interpretation of the phrase.</p>
                        <p>I then pointed out to Mr. Terasaki that I had no authority from my
                            Government to interpret the memorandum of October 2 and as I had said to
                            the Foreign Minister in a previous conversation, in connection with his
                            suggestion that the conversations be transferred from Washington to
                            Tokyo, it was Mr. Hull’s wish, in view of the active interest of the
                            President in these conversations, that they continue to be held in
                            Washington although parallel conversations might be held concurrently in
                            Tokyo. Mr. Terasaki at first seemed a little surprised by this statement
                            but I reiterated that I had already clearly conveyed this fact to
                            Admiral Toyoda. I therefore suggested that if the Japanese Government
                            was still uncertain of the meaning of any statements contained in the
                            memorandum of October 2 it might be well for Admiral Nomura to seek an
                            interview with Mr. Hull and to put these questions to him.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation reference was made by Mr. Terasaki to
                            our Government’s suggestion that the Japanese Government might helpfully
                            consider the advantage of making a public declaration with regard to its
                            expressed intention to withdraw its troops from China and Indochina so
                            that it was evident that this point had been clearly understood but this
                            particular point was not pursued in our conversation.</p>
                        <p>At the end of our talk it was once more made clear both by Mr. Terasaki
                            and myself that our conversation had been entirely personal and off the
                            record.</p>

                        <p>I called this morning on Mr. Terasaki at his request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki said that he was very anxious to obtain “off the record” my
                            impressions of the memorandum handed by the Secretary of State to
                            Admiral Nomura on October 2. I said that the Ambassador told me that Mr.
                            Terasaki had already called on the Ambassador and had received the
                            latter’s private and informal observations on the memorandum, and that I
                            did not see that I was in a <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0734"
                            />position to add anything. Mr. Terasaki then briefly summarized his
                            conversation of last night with the Ambassador, laying special emphasis
                            on the Ambassador’s observations that, in our view, the memorandum was
                            friendly in tone and helpful in substance. He went on to say that he was
                            especially interested in that portion of the memorandum which makes
                            mention of the need for Japan’s manifesting evidence of intention to
                            withdraw its forces from Indochina and China. He pointed out that the
                            paragraph under reference might be open to the interpretation that the
                            American Government expected that Japan should withdraw its forces from
                            the areas mentioned before the proposed meeting of the heads of
                            Government could be held. After remarking that possibly the passage
                            which he had in mind was open to such interpretation, I said that there
                            was obviously another one. The Japanese military forces in Indochina
                            were acting as though they were in permanent occupation of French
                            Indochina and had converted that area into a Japanese colony. It stood
                            to reason that the American Government would hesitate to make the
                            slightest move toward agreeing to the opening of formal negotiations so
                            long as the actions of the Japanese forces in Indochina constitute a
                            complete negation of the spirit and letter of the undertakings which the
                            Japanese Government expresses willingness to assume.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki said that he was not aware of the situation in French
                            Indochina to which I referred. I told him that it was extremely
                            important that he should bring himself completely up to date on recent
                            developments, and I suggested that he confer with the Director of the
                            South Seas Bureau. I referred to the actions of the Japanese military
                            forces, such as the arrests of French and Chinese nationals, seizure of
                            private property, seizure of air fields and military barracks, threats
                            to seize the Customs, etc. I expressed the belief that he would agree,
                            in view of the extremely difficult position created in Indochina by the
                            Japanese forces, that there was sound reason for assuming that the
                            American Government would not want to have the conversations progress at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. Terasaki’s question whether the Japanese formula with
                            regard to the application of the principle of equality of treatment in
                            the southwestern Pacific constituted a serious obstacle, I said that it
                            was my opinion, based on what he had said to me on various occasions,
                            that the Japanese formula under reference was not designed to be taken
                            as an expression of intention on the part of the Japanese Government to
                            confine the application of the principle of equality of opportunity to
                            the southwestern Pacific—that it was intended as an affirmation of a
                            positive intention with regard to an area in part of which the Japanese
                            Government now exercise <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> control, namely,
                            French Indochina, but that it was not intended by <pb n="669"
                                xml:id="pg_669" facs="0735"/>implication to exclude the application
                            of the principle from other areas under which the Japanese exercised
                            control. Mr. Terasaki said that that was precisely the case, and that it
                            was evident that the intentions of the Japanese Government had not been
                            clearly expressed. He thought also that the Japanese explanation with
                            regard to equality of opportunity in China, particularly the reference
                            to conditions created by geographical propinquity, were open to
                            implications the giving of which the Japanese Government had especially
                            desired to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki reverted to the reference in the October 2 memorandum to the
                            question of withdrawal of troops from China. He said that it was
                            impossible for Japan to manifest evidence, by withdrawing its troops
                            from China, of intention to effect such withdrawal, until agreement had
                            been reached between Japan and China. How then was it possible for Japan
                            to meet this requirement of the American Government? I said that I could
                            not pretend to interpret the passage under reference, but there could be
                            several ways in which the Japanese Government could demonstrate the
                            sincerity of its desire to evacuate China. It might be possible, for
                            example, to provide a time schedule of withdrawal of troops; or, again,
                            the Japanese Government might indicate willingness to consider the
                            establishment of a military police force by the Chinese Government,
                            possibly with the assistance of foreign military experts, as a
                            satisfactory substitute for the Japanese troops which Japan proposed to
                            station in Inner Mongolia and North China for the specific purpose of
                            maintaining law and order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki was summoned at this point by the Foreign Minister, and in
                            bringing our conversation to an end he expressed his appreciation for my
                            courtesy in calling on him this morning and giving him the benefit of my
                            views.</p>

                        <p>I called upon the Director of the American Bureau late this afternoon and
                            told him that the Embassy was informed that the Japanese military were
                            preparing to land on or about the 15th of October some 50,000 additional
                            troops in Tonking, French Indochina. At the direction of the Ambassador
                            I requested that Mr. Terasaki convey to the Foreign Minister the
                            personal and private opinion of Mr. Grew that the Japanese Government
                            should expect the current conversations <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670"
                                facs="0736"/>to suffer seriously adverse effects if it is prepared
                            to grant permission for such forces to be landed. Recalling to Mr.
                            Terasaki that the conversations between our two Governments had been
                            suspended because of the despatch of Japanese troops to Indochina in
                            July, and bringing to mind again the circumstances of the renewal of
                            these conversations, I stated on my own responsibility that, were the
                            proposed landing of forces carried out, I should expect a termination of
                            the conversations. Mr. Terasaki, obviously much disturbed, said that he
                            knew nothing about the matter and would immediately convey to Admiral
                            Toyoda the information which I had communicated to him.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at his request at the Secretary’s
                                apartment.<note n="29" xml:id="d367fn29">Mr. Obata accompanied the
                                Ambassador.</note> He said first of all he wished to express his
                            appreciation of the action of this Government in regard to the matter of
                            the visit to the United States of three requisitioned Japanese
                            ships.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then went on to say that he had communicated to his
                            Government our statement of October 2. He said that while he thoroughly
                            understood the position of this Government he had been instructed three
                            times during the last few days to obtain from the Secretary an
                            expression of the Secretary’s views in regard to the points on which
                            there remains a divergence of view between our two Governments. He was,
                            therefore, making this inquiry at the express and repeated instruction
                            of his Government. The Ambassador said that he understood there were
                            three points of divergence, namely: the question of the relation of the
                            two countries to the European war; the question of the stationing of
                            Japanese troops in certain areas of China; and the question of
                            application of the principle of non-discrimination to the entire Pacific
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that during our conversations up to the time
                            that the conversations were interrupted by Japan’s action in Indochina,
                            we had been talking about an understanding in regard to a peaceful
                            settlement covering the entire Pacific area; that he felt that only on
                            the basis of a broad-gauge program of universal application could we
                            expect to establish peace and stability in the Pacific area; that the
                            Japanese Prime Minister, in his statement to the President, had
                            indicated that he subscribed to the principles upon <pb n="671"
                                xml:id="pg_671" facs="0737"/>which our conversations have been
                            based; and that then came the Japanese proposals which appeared to us to
                            narrow down the application of these principles. For example, the
                            Secretary noted that we had talked about the application to the entire
                            Pacific area of the principle of non-discrimination in international
                            commercial relations, whereas the Japanese proposal seemed to call for
                            narrowing it down to the southwest Pacific area, and that it was not
                            clear what the Japanese meant when they suggested some limitation of the
                            principle of non-discrimination on account of Japan’s relations of
                            propinquity to China. The Secretary then went on to say that he would be
                            glad to have Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine see the Japanese Ambassador
                            in an endeavor to see whether any points in our respective documents
                            could be further clarified and shades of meaning brought out. The
                            Secretary added that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ballantine would then report
                            to the Secretary thereon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine said to the Japanese Ambassador that we would be glad to
                            be at his disposal at his convenience. (A little later on the Japanese
                            Ambassador asked Mr. Ballantine whether we could come right away and Mr.
                            Ballantine suggested that it might be better to wait until this
                            afternoon. That seemed agreeable to the Japanese Ambassador, and Mr.
                            Obata said to Mr. Ballantine, “Then we will get in touch with each other
                            later.”)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Japanese Prime Minister had told Ambassador
                            Grew that the Prime Minister personally subscribed in principle to the
                            four principles to which the Secretary had referred. The Ambassador
                            said, with regard to the question of stationing troops in certain areas
                            of China, that this presented to the Japanese Government a very
                            difficult question; that chaotic conditions might be expected to prevail
                            in China following the withdrawal of Japanese troops and a serious
                            question would be presented by the lack of adequate protection for
                            Japanese commercial enterprise in China. The Ambassador added that at
                            the present time there were conflicting groups within China with the
                            Kuomintang on one side and the Communists on another and that the only
                            thing that was holding the Chinese together was a common desire to
                            resist Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Ambassador whether he thought the Chinese
                            Government would agree to such a proposal as that of stationing Japanese
                            troops in China. The Ambassador made no definite reply and the Secretary
                            went on to ask whether the Ambassador did not think it possible that
                            there were sufficient number of trained Chinese troops who could be
                            counted upon to maintain order in China. The Secretary pointed out that
                            according to the experience of this country we had found maintenance of
                            troops in Latin American countries only aroused ill will and perpetuated
                            a situation of instability. <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0738"/>For
                            this reason he felt that, even though some losses and sacrifices might
                            have to be faced at the outset, in the long run the gains would justify
                            them. The Secretary referred to the situation in the South after the
                            Civil War when northern troops were stationed in southern states and to
                            the bitter resentment aroused in the South by the presence of these
                            troops. The Ambassador indicated his personal belief in the soundness of
                            what the Secretary said.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that what he wished now to say to the Secretary
                            was not as coming from the Japanese Ambassador but as expressing in
                            confidence his own personal views. He said that he had talked with a
                            great many people in this country and all of them, including Republican
                            leaders, agreed as to the complete integrity of the Secretary. The
                            Secretary said that he hoped that the Ambassador would feel free to say
                            anything that he might wish to say and that the Secretary, for his part,
                            had always felt that he could talk in complete confidence and with
                            frankness to the Ambassador. The Ambassador then said that Japan was now
                            at the crossroads and the Japanese Government was in a very difficult
                            position. He remarked that it was quite true that 99 per cent of the
                            Japanese people did not want trouble with the United States but that
                            they were a disciplined people and would fight if commanded to do so.
                            The Ambassador said that there were agitators in Japan who were trying
                            to cause trouble in our relations and they were probably being assisted
                            with funds from other countries. The Ambassador then pointed out that
                            war between the United States and Japan, whatever might be the final
                            outcome, would be a very serious undertaking, as undoubtedly the
                            President, from his long experience in the Navy Department, fully
                            realized. The Ambassador, therefore, felt that both from the point of
                            view of Japan and of the United States everything possible should be
                            done by both sides to avert the possibility of a conflict between the
                            two countries. The Secretary thanked the Ambassador for having expressed
                            his views freely.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Schmidt called on the Japanese
                                Ambassador<note n="30" xml:id="d368fn30">Mr. Wakasugi, Mr. Okumura,
                                Mr. Matsudaira, and Mr. Obata were also present.</note> conformably
                            with an arrangement made earlier in the day at the suggestion of the
                            Secretary in response to questions which had been raised by the Japanese
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0739"/>
                        <p>The Japanese opened the conversation by stating that they desired to
                            inquire, as they had been instructed by the Japanese Government to do,
                            wherein and on what points the Japanese proposals made on September 25
                            (a redraft of our document given the Japanese on June 21) were
                            objectionable, unsatisfactory or unacceptable to this Government. They
                            desired to go over the proposals point by point.</p>
                        <p>Following this introduction and again later in the conversation, we
                            stated that in coming to the Japanese Embassy today we had expected that
                            they would wish to go over our October 2 document in order that we might
                            be able to clarify and elaborate any points in that document which were
                            not entirely clear to them. We added that in the document of October 2
                            it was pointed out that we believed that renewed consideration of the
                            fundamental principles long advocated by this Government might prove
                            helpful in our effort to find a meeting of minds on essential questions.
                            We remarked that we were still of that belief and that we felt the
                            October 2 document along with previous documents and statements by
                            officers of the American Government should give the Japanese Government
                            a clear outline of our thoughts. There were given, we said, in the
                            document of October 2, some examples of instances wherein we felt the
                            Japanese proposals and explanations of September 6 and subsequent dates
                            served to narrow and to restrict the broad-gauge principles we had been
                            discussing and the general assurances we had received from the Japanese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese stated that the Prime Minister had accepted “in principle”
                            the four fundamental principles which had been enumerated on several
                            occasions by the Secretary. (The Japanese Ambassador brought out this
                            point several times during the conversation.) They maintained that we
                            were therefore in agreement on principles, and that the Japanese
                            Government accepted those principles “in principle”; but that it was
                            desirable to determine wherein the American Government found objection
                            to the Japanese proposals in order that the Japanese Government could
                            consider the question of meeting, if possible, the desires of the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <p>This same approach to the problem was repeated by the Japanese numerous
                            times throughout the conversation lasting almost two hours. On each
                            occasion we endeavored in reply to point out the general desirability of
                            laying a firm foundation for any agreement or meeting between heads of
                            state by trying to reach a mutual understanding of what each Government
                            has in mind as relating not only to fundamental principles and general
                            assurances but also as to our concepts of the program and policies to be
                            followed in the practical application of those principles and
                            assurances. We tried in our discussion in so far as possible to point to
                            the October 2 document as embodying the <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674"
                                facs="0740"/>thoughts of our Government, and wherever possible we
                            employed the language of that document. We suggested that it might be
                            desirable from the viewpoint of the Japanese Government for that
                            Government itself to go over its recent proposals in the light of the
                            fundamental principles referred to and the general assurances already
                            given by the Japanese Premier and the Japanese Government. We brought
                            out the desire of our Government to seek a broad general settlement of
                            Pacific problems. On several occasions as opportunity arose in the
                            conversation we referred to previous discussions which we had had,
                            documents which we had exchanged with the Japanese and points which we
                            had made in the informal exploratory conversations. We stated that we
                            believed the Japanese Government, by reviewing those documents,
                            statements and conversations would be able clearly to understand and to
                            visualize the position of this Government. We pointed out that the
                            Secretary had informed the Japanese Ambassador that the position of this
                            Government in regard to the fundamental principles in its relations with
                            other nations was clearly portrayed in the record of those relations,
                            and that we had not from the first held anything back, but had placed
                            our position squarely on those principles.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador stated that when he had talked with the President
                            some weeks ago he (the Ambassador) had expressed his understanding that
                            there were outstanding three points of difference between the American
                            and Japanese Governments as developed in the informal conversations.
                            Those points were, the Ambassador said, enumerated by him to the
                            President and the Secretary as: (1) The question of the Tripartite Pact
                            and the inalienable right of self-defense; (2) the question of the
                            application of the principle of nondiscrimination in international
                            commercial affairs; and (3) the question of the stationing of Japanese
                            troops in Chinese territory. The Ambassador said that he had expressed
                            his own personal opinion to the President to the effect that only one of
                            those questions would probably present especial difficulty. He went on
                            to say that he believed that Prince Konoye would be able to present some
                            formula in a meeting with the President which would solve the difficult
                            question of the stationing of Japanese troops in China. He suggested
                            indirectly that the Prime Minister would find it most difficult to
                            evolve such a formula prior to such a meeting. The Ambassador went on to
                            say that the Secretary of State had pointed out at the time of the
                            meeting with the President that in addition to the three questions which
                            Ambassador Nomura had enumerated there were certain problems of
                            phraseology and the question of bringing the document (our draft of June
                            21) up to date.</p>
                        <p>We pointed out to the Japanese that following the interruption of the
                            conversations in July there had developed certain conditions and <pb
                                n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0741"/>situations in the world with
                            respect to areas north of Japan as well as French Indochina and other
                            areas and that therefore certain new questions had in fact arisen. We
                            expressed the belief, however, that when the Secretary had mentioned the
                            desirability of bringing the document up to date and of making certain
                            changes in phraseology, the Secretary merely had in mind, in addition to
                            these new situations which had arisen, such changes as we had suggested
                            on September 10 when we gave them a redraft of Section V of the proposed
                            understanding. This redraft, we believed, served to broaden the purport
                            of the document and was to the advantage of Japan. We pointed out that
                            in our belief there had been no substantial change in the attitude of
                            this Government toward questions which had been tentatively agreed upon
                            in the draft of June 21.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then stated that he understood from what we had said that
                            in addition to the three questions which remained outstanding there had
                            arisen the question of Siberia and the Japanese attitude toward Russia
                            and Japanese activities in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>We pointed out that there was also the more general and fundamental
                            question of peace in the entire Pacific area. We referred again to the
                            initial reaction of the Secretary upon receiving the Japanese proposals
                            of September 6 and added that the more we studied those proposals and
                            subsequent explanations which we had received, the stronger our feeling
                            became that those proposals and subsequent explanations narrowed and
                            restricted the broad-gauge principles and general assurances which we
                            had had in mind.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador digressed for a moment and spoke of the attitude of Japan
                            toward the Tripartite Pact. He said that the Japanese Government
                            fundamentally desires peace in the Pacific. The Japanese Government has
                            indicated its willingness to give a commitment that it will
                            independently interpret the obligations of the Tripartite Pact, and the
                            Ambassador suggested that as the Japanese Government has this
                            fundamental desire for peace in the Pacific the implication in that
                            commitment is clear.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese, as they did several times during the conversation, pointed
                            out the difficult position in which the Japanese Government will be
                            placed, if it were to meet the position of the American Government on
                            the outstanding questions and then the United States were to raise new
                            questions. They pointed out on several occasions that the principles
                            which we had outlined were “inherently good”, as were the Ten
                            Commandments and other moral precepts, the soundness of which could not
                            be controverted; but that, as a matter of practicality, there were
                            occasions when it was necessary to discuss the question of adjustments
                            in the practical application of those principles to concrete
                            problems.</p>
                        <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0742"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the Versailles conference, which he said he
                            had attended, and to the proposal of fourteen points by President
                            Wilson, which proposal, he said, led to discussions lasting a half a
                            year. The Ambassador expressed the opinion that there were no
                            insurmountable difficulties in the present situation if both sides were
                            of a mind to overcome differences. He added that he himself had noted
                            some contradictions of “the four principles” in the Japanese proposals
                            of September 6 and inquired whether if a reexamination of those
                            proposals were made, there would possibly arise new points requiring
                            further discussion. He emphasized the necessity of informing Tokyo
                            exactly of the position of this Government.</p>
                        <p>Mentioning that the Japanese public had suffered the sacrifices of four
                            years of war, the Ambassador said that his Government would necessarily
                            have to present to the Japanese people some reward for that sacrifice or
                            some attractive alternative gain. We replied that, as we had often told
                            the Japanese, our experience led us to believe that Japan stood to gain
                            more by following a progressive and constructive program of peace in the
                            entire Pacific than by any other course. We mentioned that our desire
                            was to build for future stability. We said that we had sought to avoid
                            being placed in a position of possible criticism for having tried to
                            tell the Japanese Government what it must do or must not do.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that the procedure suggested by the Japanese of taking each
                            question point by point was possibly one way of handling the situation.
                            We pointed out, however, that just as the Japanese had emphasized
                            difficult questions of domestic politics we also were faced with
                            similarly difficult questions in this country. We mentioned that the
                            Japanese had themselves suggested the desirability of avoiding becoming
                            lost in a maze of details; and spoke of the fact that the Japanese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed Ambassador Grew that he was
                            studying the October 2 document and would later make observations on
                            that document. We pointed out that, on the other hand, another way of
                            approaching this problem, which might serve to avoid becoming lost in a
                            maze of details and minutiae and to get back to fundamental principles,
                            might be to take the October 2 document and to study it in the light of
                            other statements which this Government had made and conversations which
                            the Secretary has had with the Ambassador. We pointed out again the
                            desire of this Government to accomplish a broad-gauge general settlement
                            of Pacific problems based upon the fundamental question of peace in the
                            Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador mentioned that he had received from his Government certain
                            instructions in regard to the June 21 draft which we had given him but
                            that he had been unable to deliver a document based on those
                            instructions owing to the interruption in the conversations. <pb n="677"
                                xml:id="pg_677" facs="0743"/>The Ambassador again expressed a desire
                            to obtain concrete information of the views of this Government in regard
                            to outstanding questions and differences. We once more went over the
                            position of this Government as expressed in the October 2 document and
                            referred to previous exchanges and conversations in which the views of
                            the American Government had, we believed, been extensively set
                            forth.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation the Japanese Ambassador suggested in
                            Japanese to members of his staff that a report should be sent to Tokyo
                            stating that the American Government had no concrete counterproposal to
                            make and that it would seem that the Japanese Government could either
                            redraft its proposals or could prepare a new document on the basis of
                            additional consideration of the fundamental principles which we had
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese seemed disappointed that we had avoided taking up point by
                            point their proposals of September 6 or the redraft of the proposed
                            agreement which was given Ambassador Grew on September 25. The Japanese,
                            however, expressed their appreciation of our discussion and indicated
                            that they now understood more clearly what the American Government had
                            in mind in its document of October 2 and its suggestion that “renewed
                            consideration” of fundamental principles might be helpful. We expressed
                            our readiness to meet the Ambassador and his associates at any time and
                            to be helpful in any way that we could.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the foregoing conversation we brought out our views in regard
                            to basic principles and policies, including those relating to the
                            application of the principle of equality of opportunity throughout the
                            Pacific area and to the stationing of troops of one country in the
                            territory of another country.</p>

                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to call this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The Minister began by saying that although he had given careful study to
                            the Secretary’s memorandum of October 2 he had encountered some
                            difficulty in seizing the point of the memorandum. He had, however, come
                            to the conclusion that the three questions concerning which the American
                            and Japanese Governments held divergent views were as follows: (1) the
                            maintenance of Japanese armed forces in China, (2) the respective
                            attitude of the United States and Japan in regard to the war in Europe,
                            and (3) equal opportunity in China. The Minister added that on October 3
                            he had instructed the Japanese <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0744"
                            />Ambassador in Washington to ask the Secretary whether the United
                            States Government would set forth in precise terms the obligations which
                            the United States Government wished the Japanese Government to undertake
                            with reference to the three questions mentioned above. Having heard
                            nothing from the Japanese Ambassador, he had again on October 6
                            instructed Admiral Nomura to approach the Secretary in the above sense.
                            On October 9 the Japanese Ambassador had telegraphed the Foreign
                            Minister that he had seen the Secretary on that date but that the
                            Ambassador was unable to provide the information which had been
                            requested by the Foreign Minister. Admiral Toyoda added that a week of
                            very valuable time had been wasted in an endeavor to elicit through the
                            Japanese Ambassador information which, had it been received, would have
                            measurably accelerated the present conversations. The Foreign Minister
                            had today sent further instructions to Admiral Nomura to continue his
                            efforts to obtain the desired information, but at the same time, in
                            order to prevent further delay, he was requesting that I ask my
                            Government to provide the desired information in reply to the following
                            statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Government of Japan has submitted to the Government of the
                                    United States with reference to certain questions proposals
                                    which are apparently not satisfactory to the Government of the
                                    United States. Will the American Government now set forth to the
                                    Japanese Government for its consideration the undertakings to be
                                    assumed by the Japanese Government which would be satisfactory
                                    to the American Government?</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>At this point in the conversation I took occasion to reply to the
                            criticism in the Japanese press concerning the absence of progress in
                            the present conversations, by stressing to Admiral Toyoda that the
                            American Government in the determination and execution of its policy
                            continuously considers and gives due worth to the development and state
                            of American public opinion. Admiral Toyoda remarked that public opinion
                            even in Japan could not be disregarded but that it would be a
                            comparatively easy matter to control public opinion in this country
                            provided, as a result of the suggested meeting between Prince Konoye and
                            the President, some agreement were arrived at. The Minister gave me his
                            assurances that the Japanese Government would find it possible to make
                            commitments of a far-reaching character at such a meeting but that under
                            present conditions the full extent of the undertakings which the
                            Japanese Government was willing to assume could not be set forth prior
                            to the meeting. He reiterated his concern lest the Government be unable
                            to control extremist groups in Japan if matters remain in their present
                            undetermined conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Minister having at the beginning of the conversation expressed his
                            appreciation of the message which I had sent him yesterday <pb n="679"
                                xml:id="pg_679" facs="0745"/>concerning the reported plan to send
                            additional Japanese forces into French Indochina, I reverted to this
                            point and strongly emphasized to him that the despatch of Japanese
                            reinforcements to Indochina at this juncture while the conversations
                            were in progress between our two Governments would create a very
                            delicate situation and in my opinion could not but seriously and
                            adversely affect these conversations. I told the Foreign Minister that
                            the arrival of additional Japanese forces in Indochina at this time, in
                            the light of recent activities of the Japanese authorities in Indochina
                            to which I had already drawn his attention, such as threats to take over
                            the telegraph, post, and customs, and the demands for additional air
                            bases, would inevitably give rise to the most serious suspicions in
                            regard to Japan’s aims in respect of French Indochina. The Minister
                            replied that he was giving most careful study to my private and informal
                            message on the subject and had already conferred with the Minister of
                            War and hoped to be able to give me a reply in a few days. He added that
                            he had also discussed with the War Minister the activities of the
                            Japanese authorities in Indochina to which I had drawn his attention and
                            had asked the Minister to take immediate steps to remedy the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs then told me that since he had the
                            impression that the Japanese Ambassador in Washington was apparently
                            very fatigued, serious consideration was being given to the question of
                            sending to Washington a diplomat of wide experience to assist the
                            Ambassador in carrying on the present conversations. Admiral Toyoda said
                            he had in mind a high-ranking diplomatic official with the personal rank
                            of Ambassador, but he had not yet approached the official in question
                            and was therefore uncertain as to whether he would agree to undertake to
                            accept the mission. It would be of great assistance to the Minister to
                            ascertain whether the Government of the United States, in the event that
                            it was decided to send the official in question to Washington, would be
                            prepared to make available a reservation for him on the airplane from
                            Manila to San Francisco. Admiral Toyoda said that the official in
                            question would not be accredited to the Government of the United States
                            but would be temporarily and unofficially attached to the Japanese
                            Embassy in Washington. I told the Foreign Minister that I would transmit
                            his inquiry to my Government.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the conversation, the Minister several times stressed to
                            me, in view of the importance of the time factor, the necessity of
                            expediting the progress of the conversations.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, the Minister-Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, called to
                            see me this afternoon at his request.</p>
                        <p>After the usual preliminaries Mr. Wakasugi told me that he had spent
                            exactly two weeks in Japan when he was summoned home last month. He said
                            that he wished to be completely frank in giving me an account of his
                            impressions during the time he was in his own country and he told me in
                            detail of the persons he had seen and the situation as he found it.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that as soon as he arrived he was summoned immediately
                            by Prince Takamatsu, the brother of the Emperor and who is now the
                            closest adviser of the Emperor. Immediately thereafter he was summoned
                            to interviews with two others in the Imperial family and he mentioned
                            specifically Prince Higashi Kuni. He was then summoned to the Prime
                            Minister with whom he had several conferences and then to Marquis Kido,
                            the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and likewise one of the closest
                            advisers of the Imperial family. He said that he also, of course, had
                            several conferences with the Foreign Minister and with high ranking
                            officers of the Army and of the Navy.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that on the part of all of the personages mentioned
                            above he had found the unanimous desire for the maintenance of peace
                            between Japan and the United States and the earnest and sincere hope
                            that the present conversations between the two Governments might reach a
                            satisfactory result. He said, however, that there existed, particularly
                            among the younger elements in the Army and to a lesser degree in the
                            Navy and in other spheres of activity in Japan, a small but very
                            powerful group that had placed its fortunes on the side of the Axis
                            powers and was determined to move heaven and earth to prevent the
                            reaching of any understanding between Japan and the United States and to
                            bring Japan squarely into full activity on the side of Germany. He said
                            quite frankly that German representatives and German agents in Japan
                            were exceedingly powerful and most effective in their propaganda and
                            were undoubtedly increasing their activities because of developments in
                            Europe. He said that while the present Japanese Government had the bulk
                            of public opinion behind it and was backed in its present policies by
                            the controlling elements in the Japanese Army and in the Japanese Navy,
                            it could not indefinitely continue the conversations with the United
                            States. It would have to show some results. He said he need not remind
                            me of the physical danger to which the members of <pb n="681"
                                xml:id="pg_681" facs="0747"/>the Japanese Government were exposed in
                            view of the kind of incident which had unfortunately taken place in
                            Japan so frequently in the past and particularly in recent years. He
                            said that if the present Japanese Government fell as a result of a <hi
                                rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>, because of assassination or because
                            it could see no hope of reaching any satisfactory adjustment with the
                            United States, there was no telling what the result might [be]. He said
                            that in all probability it would be replaced by a cabinet composed of
                            military representatives responsive solely to German pressure and that
                            in such event any hope of adjusting relations between Japan and the
                            United States must vanish at least for the time being. He said that he
                            wished to express very sincerely the situation as he saw it and to
                            emphasize the fact that while a Japanese did not speak lightly of the
                            Imperial family, the references he had made to me at the outset of our
                            conversation should make it clear that the Imperial family, as well as
                            the present Cabinet, was earnestly desirous of maintaining peace with
                            the United States and of adjusting rapidly the problems which had arisen
                            between Japan and this country.</p>
                        <p>He said that as I knew Prince Konoye had suggested a meeting between
                            himself and the President. He said that notwithstanding every effort on
                            the part of the Japanese Government to expedite the reaching of a
                            friendly understanding and notwithstanding the fact that the Japanese
                            Government had believed when it came into power in July that the
                            fundamental principles necessary for an understanding had been found, an
                            interminable time had elapsed without the reaching of any agreement and
                            that it seemed impossible for the Japanese Government to find out what
                            in reality were the desires of the United States and what in reality was
                            the agreement which the United States desired to achieve. He said that
                            acting under personal instructions from the Prime Minister, but
                            nevertheless at this stage acting unofficially and without requesting
                            any commitment from me, he would greatly appreciate it if I could tell
                            him what the reasons for the delay might be or what the points of
                            clarification were which this Government still desired to obtain from
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Minister that it seemed to me impossible to believe that
                            the Japanese Government did not in fact have a very clear and specific
                            understanding of the position of this Government. I said that the views
                            of this Government had been fully set forth not only in the innumerable
                            conversations which the Secretary of State had had with the Japanese
                            Ambassador, but more specifically in the presentation of our views in
                            the documents given to the Japanese Ambassador on June 21. I said that
                            after that date this Government had believed that very satisfactory
                            progress was being made <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0748"/>and
                            that the two Governments were finding common bases for understanding
                            when, through the statement given this Government on September 6, it
                            appeared to our regret that the Japanese Government seemed to restrict,
                            to limit and to modify very materially the broad principles upon which
                            we had thought a basis for an understanding had already been reached.
                            Subsequent to September 6, I said, it was my understanding that the
                            Secretary of State had had several clarifying conversations with the
                            Japanese Ambassador and that the views of this Government with regard
                            thereto had again been very clearly set forth in an oral statement given
                            the Japanese Ambassador on October 2.</p>
                        <p>I said therefore that since I was sure Mr. Wakasugi had fully
                            familiarized himself since his return to Washington with all of these
                            conversations and the more recent statements to which I had referred,
                            there was nothing more that I could add which would clarify the issues
                            in any useful manner beyond the clarifications already advanced.</p>
                        <p>I said that one of the chief difficulties from the standpoint of this
                            Government in appreciating the position of the Japanese Government
                            throughout the course of these conversations had been the fact that
                            while the whole foundation upon which the striving for the reaching of
                            an agreement had been predicated, namely, the maintenance of peace in
                            the Pacific, the Japanese Government, as I had emphasized to Mr.
                            Wakasugi just before he left for Japan, had undertaken military action
                            in Indochina and had undertaken military activities in the north which
                            would seem to belie entirely the main purpose for which the reaching of
                            an agreement was sought. Only recently, I said, I had regretted to
                            receive reports which would seem to indicate that the Japanese
                            Government was contemplating further military activities in Indochina.
                            From this standpoint I said it seemed unfortunately that the overt
                            actions of the Japanese Government did not correspond to the purposes
                            which the Japanese Government assured us they were seeking in their
                            conversations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then said that the Axis agents in Japan had sedulously, and
                            to a certain extent successfully, spread the belief that this Government
                            was deliberately delaying negotiations in order to delay them with no
                            desire on its part to reach an understanding with Japan. I replied that
                            it happened that only this morning I had seen a newspaper article
                            alleging that the Government of Japan was adopting exactly this same
                            policy in order to gain time for its own interests. I said that I could
                            assure the Minister that this Government was sincerely desirous of
                            exploring every possible field in order to reach a satisfactory
                            understanding and that I felt that the two Governments, since they had
                            pursued the conversations this far, must recognize <pb n="683"
                                xml:id="pg_683" facs="0749"/>the sincerity of the other party to the
                            conversations in desiring to find a real understanding.</p>
                        <p>The final and very insistent question of the Minister was whether this
                            Government had any other major demands to make as a part of the present
                            conversations and which had not yet been submitted to the Japanese
                            Government. I said that with regard to this question I could only
                            reiterate what I had said at the outset of our talk, namely, that I
                            believed that the views of this Government had been fully set forth in
                            the documents of June 21 and in the oral statements subsequently
                            transmitted to the Japanese Government and that it was not the policy of
                            the Government of the United States, in an important negotiation of this
                            type, to attempt to deceive or to mislead the other party to the
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that of course he recognized that the action taken by
                            his Government in Indochina seemed at variance with the policies which
                            both Governments desired to pursue. He said, however, that Japanese
                            opinion in governmental circles felt that the action taken in Indochina
                            had been for purposes of defense and was entirely analogous to the
                            action taken by the United States in Iceland. He said that the
                            occupation of Indochina had been undertaken through agreement with a
                            government which was occupied by Germany and that the occupation by the
                            United States of Iceland had likewise been undertaken through an
                            agreement with Denmark, a country also occupied by Germany.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the Minister was in error. I said that the Government of
                            the United States had had no conversations with the Government of
                            Denmark concerning Iceland, which was a country divorced from Denmark,
                            and that the agreement for occupation of Iceland had been reached
                            through a free agreement on the part of the Government of Iceland and on
                            the part of the Government of the United States. Furthermore, I said, as
                            I had already in an earlier conversation pointed out to Mr. Wakasugi, no
                            one could possibly maintain that the Japanese Government feared any
                            threat of aggression on the part of any other power through Indochina,
                            whereas the Government of the United States, confronting a situation in
                            Europe in which the Government of Germany was steadily and increasingly
                            threatening the vital interests of the United States, was obliged to
                            enter into the agreement which it had reached with the Government of
                            Iceland as a means of self-defense against Germany and as a means of
                            averting the imminent peril to the United States which would result from
                            the occupation by Germany of Iceland or of any other region in the
                            Atlantic which was vitally necessary for the defense of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then went on to say that he felt that in some of the
                            fundamental principles which this Government thought had been <pb
                                n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0750"/>restricted by the Japanese
                            Government in the statement of September 6 there had been unnecessary
                            misunderstanding through the use of unfortunate phraseology. He said
                            that the Japanese Government was entirely willing to commit itself to
                            undertake no aggressive moves either to the south or to the north. He
                            said that although the Japanese Government in its statement of September
                            6 with regard to a possible move against Russia had used the phrase that
                            it would not undertake aggressive action in the north “save for
                            justifiable reasons”, this latter phrase was entirely unnecessary and
                            could readily be withdrawn. He said it had been intended solely to
                            indicate that if the Stalin government collapsed and some other foreign
                            power undertook to operate in eastern Siberia or if a complete case of
                            anarchy broke out in eastern Siberia as had been the case in 1919 and
                            1920, the Japanese Government in that event would find it necessary to
                            defend its own interests in the interest of “Manchukuo” against such
                            aggression from that source. He repeated, however, that this phrase
                            could be eliminated and that the Japanese Government was prepared to
                            make a full commitment to undertake no aggressive activities to the
                            north, south or anywhere else in the Pacific region.</p>
                        <p>I said that this was a very interesting and gratifying statement on his
                            part and that I believed it tended to clarify a question which to us was
                            of the utmost importance. He further went on to say that it was evident
                            that this Government had been disturbed by the phraseology employed with
                            regard to equal treatment and nondiscrimination in commercial relations
                            in the Pacific and that the Japanese statement of September 6 had
                            apparently given the impression that China was omitted from this
                            commitment and that it applied only to the southwestern Pacific region.
                            He said further that on this point the Japanese Government would be
                            entirely willing to undertake to reach an agreement along the broad and
                            general lines which we had in mind.</p>
                        <p>He then asked, with regard to the obligations of Japan under the Axis
                            pact, whether this Government could not agree to leave the “discretion”
                            of Japan as to the interpretation of its obligations under such pact to
                            the determination of the Japanese Government. He said he realized fully
                            that any new Cabinet that came in might determine Japan’s obligations in
                            a manner different from that in which the present Japanese Cabinet would
                            determine its obligations, but that as a matter of practical fact the
                            present Japanese Cabinet was the only Cabinet which could be set up
                            which would desire to maintain peace with the United States should the
                            United States go to war. I said that on this point I felt that the
                            position of this Government had already been made fully clear by the
                            Secretary of <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0751"/>State and that I
                            would have to refer this question to the Secretary of State to determine
                            whether any further clarification was necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then brought up the question of evacuation of Japanese
                            troops from China. He said that the Japanese Government was willing to
                            evacuate all of its troops from China. (Thinking I had misunderstood him
                            I asked him to repeat this statement which he did, in the same terms,
                            twice.) He said, however, that it was impossible for the Japanese
                            Government after four years of military operations in China to undertake
                            to withdraw its entire troops from China within twenty-four hours. I
                            said that of course nobody expected miracles in this modern age. I said
                            with regard to this question that here again the views of this
                            Government had been made known very clearly to the Japanese Government
                            and that the Secretary of State had frequently referred to our own
                            experience and to our own policies in the Western Hemisphere as an
                            indication of what we believed the policy which would bring about peace
                            and stability in the Pacific region should be. The Minister then asked
                            whether, in the event that the President of the United States agreed to
                            mediate between Japan and China, this Government would insist on passing
                            upon the peace terms proposed by Japan before they were submitted to
                            China. I said that once more in this case our views had been made known
                            very clearly and that I was not in a position to give him any more
                            specific opinion on this point without consulting the Secretary of
                            State. I said that in general, as I had frequently explained, the point
                            of view of this Government was that should this Government undertake the
                            task of mediating, it could not undertake to transmit to the Chinese
                            Government peace terms which in its judgment were inequitable and not
                            conducive to the maintenance of a stable peace in the Pacific
                            region.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then asked whether, if it were possible to reach a basis for
                            an understanding with regard to all of the other major principles which
                            this Government regarded as fundamental, the two Governments could not
                            go ahead and leave the China question in abeyance. I said it seemed to
                            me that this question was very much like asking whether the play of
                            “Hamlet” could be given on the stage without the character of Hamlet.
                            The Minister laughed loudly and said he fully understood my point.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he would make every effort to expedite a
                            clarification of the point of view of his Government. He said he
                            believed that the underlying principles as set forth by this Government
                            on June 21 could be accepted by the Japanese Government. He said there
                            was nothing he himself desired more earnestly than the reaching of a
                            satisfactory agreement between the two countries. I said that I fully
                            corresponded to his expressed desire <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686"
                                facs="0752"/>in that regard. He said he believed that within
                            twenty-four or forty-eight hours his Government must reach a final
                            decision on the basic questions involved. He emphasized the fact that he
                            was speaking unofficially. Before he left he said that he wished me to
                            know that all of the controlling Generals in the Japanese Army and all
                            of the controlling Admirals in the Japanese Navy were supporting fully
                            the position of the Japanese Government in desiring to conclude a
                            comprehensive and satisfactory agreement with the United States. He said
                            this Government should be in no doubt that if an agreement could be
                            reached before it was too late the control of the Army and of the Navy
                            under present conditions was such as to make it sure that the Government
                            would be able to carry out and implement the terms of such
                            agreement.</p>

                        <p>I was invited to lunch alone with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            today and we had a long talk together for two hours and a half which he
                            requested should be regarded as off the record. We discussed, along
                            lines largely parallel to the Under Secretary’s conversation on October
                            13 with Mr. Wakasugi (Department’s telegram 661, October 14, 10

                            progressing in Washington.</p>
                        <p>During my meeting with the Vice Minister today the only point of
                            importance which emerged was the observation of Mr. Amau that the German
                            Government is insistently pressing for the issuance of a statement by
                            the Japanese Government in confirmation of the interpretation given to
                            the Tripartite Pact by Mr. Matsuoka, to the effect that Japan will
                            declare war on the United States in the event of war occurring between
                            Germany and the United States. As a reply, although it has not yet been
                            decided when or whether such reply will be rendered to the German
                            Government, the Japanese Government is considering a formula of a
                            noncommittal nature to the effect that maintenance of peace in the
                            Pacific is envisaged in the Tripartite Pact and that the attention of
                            the American Government has been sought for its earnest consideration of
                            Japan’s obligations under the Pact.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, Japanese Minister, called by appointment on October
                            sixteenth and seventeenth on the Under Secretary. By prearrangement, Mr.
                            Welles brought him to my office for a conversation which lasted on each
                            occasion for some two hours. The conversation consisted mainly of a
                            rehash of conversations I have had from time to time with Ambassador
                            Nomura. There were elaborations here and there with respect to certain
                            phases of the two documents which had been exchanged between the
                            Ambassador and myself representing our respective Governments. Our
                            document of June twenty-first and an elaboration of it on October second
                            had both been given to the Japanese Ambassador in an informal way with
                            the definite understanding that no stage of negotiations had been
                            reached and that these were really exploratory oral conversations
                            reduced to writing. The Minister referred to the more recent
                            communications from his Government, especially the ones received in
                            September, and to the communication sent to this Government at the time
                            the Prime Minister sent his personal message to the President requesting
                            a meeting between the two to discuss American-Japanese relations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister sought to keep in harmony with his talks with Under
                            Secretary Welles some days ago, but it was apparent that he was hedging
                            more or less on these phases, especially on the three principal points
                            of difference relating to bringing troops out of China, to applying a
                            non-discrimination commercial policy to the entire Pacific area and to
                            further clarification of the Japanese attitude towards the Tripartite
                            Pact as it might relate to the relations between Japan and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized that the proposed peaceful settlement should apply to the
                            entire Pacific area and not to just a part of it, just as United States
                            commercial policy based on the principle of equality and
                            nondiscrimination applies to the entire world, and just as similar
                            utterances apply to the entire world alike, including Japan. I then
                            referred to the different points in Japanese statements to us at the
                            time of and since the communication which accompanied the Prime
                            Minister’s communication to the President requesting a meeting wherein
                            the Japanese were narrowing both the letter and the spirit of their
                            attitude, as clearly expressed to me from March until July by Ambassador
                            Nomura. This narrowing attitude related to the range of the Pacific area
                            to be included in a settlement, to the scope and breadth of the formula
                            prescribing commercial policy based on the rule of non-discrimination,
                            to their interpretation of the application <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688"
                                facs="0754"/>of the Tripartite Pact as it relates to the United
                            States, and to the breadth and spirit and implications of Ambassador
                            Nomura’s many conversations with respect to bringing troops out of
                            China, and to the limitation of Japanese commitments against conquest to
                            the north and south only instead of a broad basic commitment on
                            principles and programs for a satisfactory peaceful settlement
                            pertaining to the entire Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>The effect of the Minister’s numerous attempts at interpretation of the
                            foregoing and of their application did not indicate progress—certainly
                            not progress as compared with the attitude existing with respect to
                            these questions, as set forth by Ambassador Nomura prior to the
                            disruption of our conversations resulting from the occupation by Japan
                            of Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The Minister spent much time attempting an unsatisfactory interpretation
                            of the Tripartite Pact as it might affect us, by urging that it was a
                            peace instrument and very slightly implying that, therefore, it was not
                            aimed at us. I reminded him that for months it was proclaimed as
                            intended principally to keep this country out of war with Germany and
                            that it was a joint movement on the part of Japan and Germany to this
                            end. It was, therefore, no easy matter for us to convince this country
                            that it was a harmless document; that Japan herself must say and do the
                            things necessary to disabuse the public mind in this country of the very
                            unfriendly implication of the Tripartite Pact. There the matter rested
                            despite the Minister’s labored effort to give it a different
                            interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The Minister strove for some time to show the necessity for Japanese
                            troops being retained in China. I brought up the many facts and
                            circumstances showing the great benefit it would be to Japan to get her
                            troops out and mark off some temporary losses in one way or another and
                            begin the work of restoring friendship and trade between the two
                            countries under the broad principles of friendly international relations
                            which underlie the peaceful settlement proposals of the United States. I
                            reminded the Minister that the Japanese invasion has resulted in the
                            establishment of many monopolies in China and many special privileges
                            and benefits in various ways, which probably accounts for the main
                            desire of Japan to keep troops in China, that Japan can never regain the
                            friendship of China while she keeps troops there, that a settlement of
                            the Chinese situation necessarily dovetails into the formula which this
                            Government has suggested for a peaceful settlement for the entire
                            Pacific area, and that the Chinese phase must be included in any such
                            wide settlement. We went over many of the phases that had been discussed
                            between Ambassador Nomura and myself with respect to bringing troops out
                            of China and the Chinese situation generally.</p>

                        <p>On the question of a broad basic liberal commercial policy such as this
                            Government stands for and has proposed to Japan along with all other
                            nations, the Minister and I discussed numerous phases, pro and con,
                            without anything especially new being brought out, except that I
                            emphasized the earnest desire of this Government for such a provision to
                            be included in any Pacific area settlement by pointing to our recent
                            trade agreement with the Argentine,<note n="32a" xml:id="d372fn32a"

                            all other countries equal access with ourselves to the markets there,
                            and also to the numerous discussions this Government is having with the
                            British and the British Dominions with respect to the removal of empire
                            preferences and other discriminations, including the narrow policy of
                            bilateral trade, and suggested strongly that Japan was more interested
                            in this course than almost any nation, and yet she was opposing the
                            application of the policy of non-discrimination in the Pacific. The
                            Minister finally said that he was not disagreeing and that he would
                            communicate at once with his Government to see if it would not accept
                            this broad proposal. I said that was good and asked him to let me know
                            when he hears from his Government. The upshot of our exploratory
                            conversations left us with the view that the new Japanese

                            serious conversations with their representatives here. We also derived
                            the definite impression that there were no present signs of the Japanese
                            Government coming back anywhere near the position it occupied in our
                            exploratory conversations when they were temporarily abandoned at the
                            time Japan went into Indochina. We are not very expectant in this line
                            so far as future conversations are concerned, but we shall give them a
                            full opportunity to say what they may have in mind to say.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Ushiba telephoned me early this morning while I was still dressing
                            and asked whether he might call on me at my house. He arrived as I was
                            having breakfast. He is normally well composed, but this morning he was
                            nervous and excited. He said that he had been up all night helping
                            Prince Konoye to make arrangements for the transfer of office to the
                            incoming Prime Minister.</p>
                        <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0756"/>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba then handed me, unopened, a personal letter from the Prime
                            Minister to the American Ambassador and asked that I deliver it to Mr.
                            Grew. (Copy of Prince Konoye’s letter and copy of the Ambassador’s reply
                            thereto are attached to this memorandum.) He suggested that I read it,
                            as he had been instructed to tell me in the strictest confidence certain
                            thoughts which his chief had in mind. The substance of Mr. Ushiba’s
                            statement was as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Secretary’s memorandum of October 2 which had been handed to the
                            Japanese Ambassador in Washington had been a great disappointment to the
                            Konoye Cabinet and the impression had been created inside the Cabinet
                            that the road had been blocked to any hopes that the present
                            conversations could be successfully concluded. Prince Konoye about a
                            week ago had decided to resign in view of the internal situation in
                            Japan. At that time it appeared inevitable that the succeeding Cabinet
                            would be one of an extremist nature but Prince Konoye through intensive
                            effort and “by a miracle” had in recent days been successful in ensuring
                            that the government to succeed him would be composed of persons who did
                            not subscribe to the principle that the conversations with the United
                            States should be broken off.</p>
                        <p>No Japanese civilian statesman will undertake the task in which Prince
                            Konoye has failed and consequently the succeeding Cabinet must be headed
                            by an Army officer and will be composed primarily of military men. The
                            new Cabinet may even appear to be extremist to persons unacquainted with
                            the set-up of the various groups within the Japanese Army and other
                            factions having influence in the Government. However, Prince Konoye
                            entertains the hope that the Ambassador will stress to the Government of
                            the United States that too great importance should not be given to the
                            outward appearance of the new Cabinet. Prince Konoye also desires the
                            Ambassador to understand that he would not have tendered his resignation
                            at this moment without having convinced himself that the succeeding
                            Prime Minister would be equally desirous of adjusting Japanese-American
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador would readily appreciate, Mr. Ushiba added, that it would
                            be impossible at the present time to form a civilian Cabinet with a
                            liberal tinge: there is in Japan no civilian of adequate eminence to
                            take over the office of Prime Minister, and even if such a civilian
                            government should be formed, sufficient opposition to bring about its
                            downfall would rapidly arise. Consequently the succeeding Cabinet must
                            be composed primarily of military men by reason of the fact that a
                            Cabinet of this complexion would represent the only element in Japan
                            which at the present time would be capable of bringing about the
                            downfall of the government. Mr. Ushiba emphasized that only as the
                            result of the intensive and miraculous labors <pb n="691"
                                xml:id="pg_691" facs="0757"/>of Prince Konoye will the next
                            government not be a military dictatorship bound to the most militaristic
                            and drastic policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ushiba concluded that Prince Konoye, although out of the government,
                            will from the background continue to use his influence and to devote his
                            best efforts to the achievement of the aims sought for in the
                            conversations between the United States and Japan and he is hopeful that
                            these conversations will be resumed very shortly.</p>
                        <p>I said that it was a great pity that Prince Konoye had felt it necessary
                            to resign as the conversations in Washington were still in progress, the
                            recent call of Mr. Wakasugi on the Under Secretary of State having had,
                            in my opinion, good results toward further clarifying the position of
                            the Japanese Government. Mr. Ushiba said that he hoped some day to be
                            able to tell me of the events which had led to the Cabinet’s
                            resignation, but that all that he could say for the present was that
                            Prince Konoye had taken the decision in the confident belief that he
                            could thus bring the conversations to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>I said that it was a great pity that the Japanese Army did not have a
                            great leader, such as Prince Yamagata, who could insure unity within the
                            Army. Mr. Ushiba agreed. He said that General Sugiyama, Chief of the
                            General Staff, was being touted as such a leader, but that actually
                            General Sugiyama was too pliant an instrument for his subordinates. In
                            his opinion, General Umedzu, chief of the Kwantung Army, was the most
                            influential man in the Army and would come forward when needed.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. Ushiba was about to leave, I asked that he convey to Prince Konoye
                            my assurance that I would immediately see the Ambassador.</p>

                                and disappointment that my colleagues and I have had to resign owing

                                by the mere appearance or impression of the new cabinet. I assure

                            <p>May I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for
                                your most friendly cooperation which I have been fortunate enough to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Prime Minister</hi>: Your friendly
                                letter of October 16th is very deeply appreciated and I hasten to

                                conclusion the conversations carried on between our two Governments.
                                It gives me keen gratification to know that you yourself will assist
                                the new cabinet in attaining the high purpose for which you and your
                                colleagues have striven, and I need hardly assure you that your
                                successor may count fully on my own earnest cooperation in a

                        <p>The Japanese Minister, Mr. Wakasugi, called to see me this afternoon at
                            his request.</p>
                        <p>The Minister first of all stated that he had instructions from the
                            Japanese Government to inform this Government that in its relations with
                            the United States it desired to pursue the policy of the preceding
                            Government and desired to continue without delay the conversations which
                            had taken place between the two Governments with a view to finding a
                            satisfactory agreement to both Governments.</p>
                        <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0759"/>
                        <p>The Minister stated that, in his belief, the new Japanese Government had
                            taken office under such circumstances and was pressed by tense public
                            opinion to such an extent as to make it imminently desirable that the
                            conversations be pressed to a satisfactory conclusion speedily.</p>
                        <p>The Minister further stated that he was instructed to inquire whether
                            this Government had as yet any counterproposals to make to the
                            suggestions offered by the Japanese Government on September 27.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I felt it necessary to speak openly and entirely frankly in
                            reply to this message.</p>
                        <p>I said that the United States had made it fully clear during the past
                            seven or eight months that it was glad to hold these conversations with
                            the Japanese Government and that it desired to find the basis for an
                            equitable agreement between the two Governments and that they desired to
                            attain such a desirable objective as rapidly as possible. I said,
                            however, that the Minister must recognize, as clearly as I did, that
                            recent statements made by prominent officials of the Japanese Government
                            and the Japanese Army and the Japanese Navy were not conducive to the
                            creation of that kind of atmosphere which would be conducive to the
                            reaching of any satisfactory understanding between the two Governments
                            for the furtherance of the conversations which the two Governments had
                            in mind. I said that, when a responsible officer of the Japanese Navy
                            publicly announced that the Japanese Navy was “itching to fight” with
                            the United States Navy, the result was disastrous in its effects upon
                            public opinion here and particularly in its effects upon the American
                            Navy. I said that I had, to my regret, seen very few statements if any,
                            by high authorities of Japan during the past two weeks which could be
                            interpreted as meaning that the Japanese Government had any sincere
                            desire to reach a friendly and satisfactory understanding with the
                            United States as a result of the present conversations. Furthermore, I
                            said, the whole tone of the Japanese press, as well as articles and
                            editorials appearing in the Japanese press, during the same period could
                            only be interpreted as meaning that the Japanese press was not
                            interested in the furtherance of any satisfactory understanding between
                            our two countries. I said I felt it necessary to make these facts very
                            clear in as much as Mr. Wakasugi would undoubtedly agree that the
                            situation to which I referred created an additional and serious obstacle
                            to any satisfactory outcome of the conversations which have been in
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied by saying that he had seen only an hour ago on the
                            ticker a statement attributed to Secretary Knox which said war between
                            Japan and the United States was inevitable and that, consequently, the
                            United States Navy was on a 24-hour basis. I stated that I had not seen
                            any statement by Secretary Knox indicating his belief <pb n="694"
                                xml:id="pg_694" facs="0760"/>that war was inevitable between our two
                            countries, but that I had seen and read statements attributed to him
                            which implied that the situation was such that some incident might occur
                            and that, consequently, the United States Navy was on a 24-hour basis. I
                            said that the Minister’s reference to these statements attributed to
                            Secretary Knox clearly emphasized the truth of what I had just stated to
                            him. If the Japanese Navy announced to the world that it was “itching
                            for a fight” with the United States, he could hardly underestimate the
                            effect which this would have upon the American Navy.</p>
                        <p>I said that I felt I must make it very clear that this Government would
                            have to take into serious account statements and press campaigns of the
                            kind to which I have referred in considering the utility of trying to
                            find a successful outcome of the present conversations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point he had mentioned by instruction of his
                            Government I said that I was confident I had made it entirely plain in
                            my first conversation with him after his return to the United States and
                            that Secretary Hull, in our two succeeding conversations, had made it
                            even more plain that the point of view of this Government had been set
                            forth with complete clarity in communications handed to the Japanese
                            Government on June 21, in the succeeding conversations between the
                            Secretary of State and the Japanese Ambassador, and in the statement
                            delivered to the Japanese Embassy on October 2. I said that it did not
                            seem to me that any counterproposals were called for from this
                            Government. In our last conversation with the Secretary of State I said
                            the latter had impressed upon the Minister the value from Japan’s own
                            standpoint of the economic principles this Government had offered as one
                            of the bases for an understanding between our two countries. The
                            Minister had then said that he would transmit this to his Government and
                            let us have their reply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi said that he had in fact transmitted to his Government the
                            statements of Secretary Hull in the fullest detail, but that he had not
                            yet heard from his Government with regard thereto.</p>
                        <p>I said that the Secretary of State and I had both said with regard to the
                            Minister’s statement earlier made to me that the phraseology employed in
                            the Japanese project of September 27 had perhaps given rise to
                            misunderstandings and could undoubtedly be modified so as to make it
                            clear that the Japanese point of view corresponded much more nearly to
                            the position of this Government as set forth in its communications on
                            June 21, that we would be glad to sit down with the Minister and
                            consider any such changes in phraseology as he might be willing to
                            suggest. I said that I was optimistic enough to believe that an effort
                            of this kind might result in our ascertaining that the point of view of
                            the Japanese Government was far more <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695"
                                facs="0761"/>nearly identical to the point of view of the United
                            States Government than would appear from the Japanese proposals of
                            September 27.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he had not as yet received any detailed
                            instruction from his Government, but that he was hopeful he would
                            receive such detailed instructions in the immediate future. He then said
                            that as far back as last April he had urged his Ambassador to try and
                            find practical and concrete bases for agreement with the United States
                            Government on all phases of the situation affecting the Pacific region.
                            He said that certain American gentlemen who were unofficial and certain
                            Japanese gentlemen who were unofficial, and who had (undoubtedly
                            sincerely, as he put it) been endeavoring to further friendly relations
                            between our two countries, had stepped into the picture and devised
                            certain formulas and, he was afraid, had succeeded in obscuring the
                            picture rather than clarifying it. He said he thought these efforts had
                            resulted in a good deal of delay. He consequently wondered whether it
                            would not be advantageous to make a fresh approach and, with full regard
                            for the principles set forth by this Government, to undertake the
                            development of new formulas. I said to the Minister that I thought this
                            suggestion might be very helpful and, if he would prepare the new
                            formulas which he had in mind, they would receive immediate
                            consideration here. I said that everyone, from the Secretary of State
                            down, had made it clear that we would be only too glad to contribute as
                            much time and thought as might be necessary in order to further a
                            satisfactory solution.</p>
                        <p>I stated that it seemed to me that from the standpoint of expediency and
                            wisdom it might be well to see if we could not, first of all, reach an
                            agreement on the economic principles involved. I wondered, I said, if
                            the statesmen in the new Japanese cabinet understood as fully as he did
                            what the practical advantages to Japan would be if it adopted the
                            economic policies as set forth by Secretary Hull. Surely, I said, they
                            must recognize, if they understood it, how much Japan would profit if,
                            for example, British imperial preferences were abolished and Japan could
                            trade with all of the Pacific nations, including Canada, Australia and
                            New Zealand, on the same terms on which England could trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi seemed to be very sincere in emphasizing his own belief in
                            the desirability of Japanese wholehearted agreement in the
                            nondiscrimination commercial policy proposed by this Government. I said
                            that if we could reach an agreement on this front we could then pass
                            with more encouragement to finding a satisfactory agreement with regard
                            to the other principles advanced by the United States. I emphasized my
                            belief that it would be wise to take up the more knotty problems after
                            we had reached an agreement on what perhaps was the principle on which
                            both Governments could agree now.</p>
                        <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0762"/>
                        <p>The Minister then went back to the thread-bare issue of the belief on the
                            part of the Japanese people that their failure to possess certain
                            natural resources under their own sovereignty made them the victims of
                            economic aggression and economic encirclement at the will of other
                            powers. I asked the Minister if he, or any other Japanese, could deny
                            that, during the period of their modern history up to the year 1930,
                            when Japan had a most friendly relationship with both Great Britain and
                            the United States, through that relationship and because of the fact
                            that their national policy was in general alignment with the policy of
                            the two Governments I had mentioned, Japan had not rapidly become one of
                            the great powers of the world and had enjoyed a period of great
                            prosperity. The Minister said that of course that was the case. I said
                            it seemed to me that Japan had never even thought of alleging economic
                            encirclement until the sinister slogan brought forward by Hitler of
                            “have and have not nations” had been dinned into the ears of the peoples
                            of the world and until Japan herself had departed from her traditional
                            friendships and had engaged upon new adventures and policies.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that, while it was true that the younger generation in
                            Japan had been responsive to the pernicious disease which was spreading
                            over the world, Japan nevertheless was pursuing her own independent
                            policies and was not to be regarded as being subservient in her national
                            determinations of policy to either Germany or Italy. I said that this
                            might be the case but that Japan nevertheless formally and officially
                            and publicly had placed herself in the Axis camp and that no friend of
                            Japan could deny that, so far as practical results were concerned and so
                            far as the well-being and prosperity of the Japanese people were
                            involved, Japan had not only gained nothing therefrom but had been
                            gravely prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi made no denial of this. He remained quiet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then changed the subject and said that in his last
                            conversation with Secretary Hull the latter had inquired whether he had
                            any contacts with Chinese friends here in this country. The Minister
                            reminded me that he had replied that while he knew the Chinese
                            Ambassador, Dr. Hu Shih, he was not seeing him on account of the
                            situation between his country and China. The Minister said that it
                            seemed to him all important that every approach be undertaken in order
                            to bring about a settlement of the conflict between China and Japan,
                            since nothing would be more conducive than this to a settlement of all
                            of the Pacific problems. He inquired whether—and he stated that this was
                            to be regarded as entirely unofficial—I would be willing to meet with
                            himself and the Chinese Ambassador or any other Chinese officials who
                            might be able to speak for their country. He said that if any official
                            effort was ever to be made by the President <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697"
                                facs="0763"/>of the United States to further the reaching of a
                            peaceful solution between Japan and China it must certainly first be
                            ascertained whether the Government of Chiang Kai-Shek would be disposed
                            to reach an agreement with Japan.</p>
                        <p>I replied that obviously the Minister did not expect me even personally
                            and unofficially to give him any response to this suggestion without
                            very careful consideration and the opportunity to study this
                            possibility. I said that I would, however, give the matter the most
                            careful thought and that I would be prepared to discuss with him in one
                            of our next conversations what my individual views might be as to the
                            feasibility of the suggestion he had made.</p>
                        <p>The Minister made no reference to any plans for departure on the part of
                            the Ambassador and I did not question him with regard thereto. He did,
                            however, specifically state that as soon as more detailed instructions
                            were received from his Government the Ambassador would be taking part in
                            the conversations between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that as soon as these instructions were received he
                            would immediately let me know and that he would urge his Government to
                            expedite the sending of such instructions.</p>

                        <p>The informant<note n="34" xml:id="d375fn34">“A reliable Japanese
                                informant.”</note> called on me at his own request this evening. He
                            told me that just prior to the fall of the Konoye Cabinet a conference
                            of the leading members of the Privy Council and of the Japanese armed
                            forces had been summoned by the Emperor, who inquired if they were
                            prepared to pursue a policy which would guarantee that there would be no
                            war with the United States. The representatives of the Army and Navy who
                            attended this conference did not reply to the Emperor’s question,
                            whereupon the latter, with a reference to the progressive policy pursued
                            by the Emperor Meiji, his grandfather, in an unprecedented action
                            ordered the armed forces to obey his wishes. The Emperor’s definite
                            stand necessitated the selection of a Prime Minister who would be in a
                            position effectively to control the Army, the ensuing resignation of
                            Prince Konoye, and the appointment of General Tojo who, while remaining
                            in the Army active list, is committed to a policy of attempting to
                            conclude successfully the current Japanese-American conversations.</p>
                        <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0764"/>
                        <p>The informant emphasized to me that the recent anti-American tone of the
                            Japanese press and the extreme views expressed by pro-Axis and certain
                            other elements gave no real indication of the desire of Japanese of all
                            classes and in particular of the present political leaders that in some
                            way or other an adjustment of relations with the United States must be
                            brought about. He added in this connection that Mr. Togo, the new
                            Foreign Minister, had accepted his appointment with the specific aim of
                            endeavoring to pursue the current conversations to a successful end and
                            it had been understood that should he fail in this he would resign his
                            post.</p>
                        <p>The belief is current among Japanese leaders that the principal
                            difficulty in the way of an understanding with the United States is the
                            question of the removal of Japanese armed forces from China and
                            Indochina, but these same leaders are confident that, provided Japan is
                            not placed in an impossible position by the insistence on the part of
                            the United States that all Japanese troops in these areas be withdrawn
                            at once, such a removal can and will be successfully effected.</p>
                        <p>The informant, who is in contact with the highest circles, went on to say
                            that for the first time in ten years the situation at present and the
                            existing political set-up in Japan offer a possibility of a
                            reorientation of Japanese policy and action.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese press has given prominence to the remarks made by the
                            American Secretary of the Navy to the effect that the Government of the
                            United States has become convinced that Japan does not intend to abandon
                            its policy of expansion and that should this policy be pursued a
                            conflict with the United States is unavoidable. From the vantage point
                            of this Embassy it is apparent that while the widespread conviction in
                            the United States and abroad that Japan has no intention of giving up
                            its policy of expansion may be logical, nevertheless the fallacy of this
                            view may be found in the fact that the present Japanese leaders are
                            willing to give up their expansionist plans through armed force if a
                            workable understanding can be reached with the United States.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the informant’s observations, there is little that can be
                            added to the analysis set forth in my telegram to the Department No.
                            1529 of September 29, noon, and the suggestions advanced therein,
                            particularly in paragraphs 5 and 10, still obtain despite the fact that
                                <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0765"/>the procedure of
                            negotiations anticipated in the suggested meeting between the President
                            and the Japanese Prime Minister may now have to be changed. If, as I
                            have no reason to doubt, the informant’s statement that the Emperor is
                            for the first time actively engaged in the formulation of policy in
                            Japan and the announced aim of reaching an agreement with the United
                            States is true, some more positive attempt by General Tojo and the new
                            Foreign Minister to render the current conversations more concrete than
                            has heretofore been the case may be anticipated, an opinion, however,
                            which must be mere speculation until I have seen the new Foreign
                            Minister. In this connection, whatever may be the character of the
                            Foreign Minister’s approach, in our first conversation I shall of course
                            initiate nothing and shall make it clear that my Government desires that
                            the conversations be continued in Washington and only paralleled
                            here.</p>
                        <p>From the available information I am quite convinced that had the Emperor
                            not taken the positive stand which he did on this issue, the situation
                            mentioned in paragraph 8 of my 1529, September 29, noon, would probably
                            have developed.</p>

                        <p>The diplomatic chiefs of mission were received this afternoon by Mr.
                            Shigenori Togo, the new Foreign Minister. Mr. Kase acted as interpreter.
                            The usual press photographs having been taken and appropriate amenities
                            exchanged, Mr. Togo remarked that the relations between the United
                            States and Japan, which had not been very good when he formerly was in
                            the Foreign Office several years ago, had since then progressively
                            worsened to the present situation which, if this deterioration were not
                            terminated, was fraught with the gravest dangers. Referring to the
                            informal conversations which had been carried on since last spring
                            between the Japanese and the American Governments, the Minister declared
                            his desire that the conversations be continued and without delay be
                            successfully brought to a conclusion. He requested my cooperation in
                            accomplishing this objective.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Togo said that in order to make progress, the United States should
                            face certain realities and facts and he thereupon cited the stationing
                            in China of Japanese armed forces. Other nations, he said, at present
                            maintained troops in certain areas of China, for instance the Soviet
                            soldiery stationed in Outer Mongolia. The Minister made no further
                            allusion to the preliminary conversations but stated that he hoped to
                            have subsequent talks with me in due time.</p>
                        <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0766"/>
                        <p>After assuring the Minister, in reply, of my desire to cooperate with
                            him, I described the wish of the Secretary of State that, because of the
                            President’s close and active interest therein, the conversations should
                            be carried on in Washington. However, as parallel talks in Tokyo were
                            often helpful in that they afforded an opportunity for rendering more
                            complete and more precise the reported views of the United States
                            Government, I had on certain occasions in the past conveyed to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs the substance of the conversations in
                            Washington which were reported to me directly from the Secretary of

                            telegram reporting the Under Secretary’s conversation with Mr. Wakasugi
                            on October 24 (Department’s 689, October 25, 5 p.m.<note n="35"

                            therefrom a clear understanding of the attitude of the Government of the
                            United States toward these preliminary conversations.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Tojo that, as it was of course impossible for the Foreign
                            Minister personally to read all of the correspondence directed by the
                            American Embassy to the Foreign Office, it had been in the past my
                            practice to bring in separate letters to the direct attention of Admiral
                            Toyoda, with the latter’s approval, those matters which I had considered
                            of especial importance. In reply to my question whether Mr. Togo would
                            approve of my observing the same practice with him, the Minister replied
                            in the affirmative and the interview was brought to a close.</p>
                        <p>As I was leaving, Mr. Kase told me that he had been designated Chief of
                            the First Section of the American Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs and that he would be happy to serve as a direct avenue of
                            communication between the Foreign Minister and myself whenever I might
                            desire. In thanking Mr. Kase I said that, recalling our former pleasant
                            association, I was glad once again to find him in the role of
                            interpreter during my conversations with the Foreign Minister.</p>

                        <p>I received a visit today from the same reliable Japanese informant who
                            called on me on October 25. He informed me that he had seen the Foreign
                            Minister yesterday with a view to ascertaining the prospects of a
                            resumption of the conversations between Japan and the United States. The
                            Foreign Minister had told him that during <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701"
                                facs="0767"/>the past few days he had been constantly in conference
                            day and night with the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Navy, and
                            that as a result the Government had reached a definite decision as to
                            how far it was prepared to go in implementing the desires of the Emperor
                            for an adjustment of relations with the United States. This decision,
                            which was being held in strictest secrecy, had been communicated by the
                            Prime Minister to the Emperor on the afternoon of November 2. The
                            Foreign Minister had conveyed to my informant the impression that he
                            expected to ask me to call for an extended conversation within a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>According to my informant this was the first time for many years that a
                            Japanese Foreign Minister had been in a position to assume obligations
                            with the entire support and approval of the Prime Minister, who was an
                            Army officer on the active list and who held as well the portfolios of
                            the War and Home ministries, and also the support of the Navy Minister.
                            My informant was of the opinion that the Foreign Minister would ask me
                            to call not later than November 7 since the question of relations with
                            the United States would have to be clarified before the Diet meets on
                            November 15 at which time a report would have to be delivered. The
                            forthcoming meeting of the Diet, according to my informant, would be
                            carefully organized by the Government and no loose or irresponsible talk
                            would be permitted.</p>
                        <p>I thanked my informant for his information and repeated to him what I had
                            told the Foreign Minister, namely, that the actual conversations were to
                            be carried on in Washington and only paralleled in Tokyo.</p>

                                        <item>In Japan political thought ranges from medieval to
                                            liberal ideas and public opinion is thus a variable
                                            quantity. The impact of events and conditions beyond
                                            Japan may determine at any given time which school of
                                            thought shall predominate. (In the democracies, on the
                                            other hand, owing to a homogeneous body of principles
                                            which influence and direct foreign policy and because
                                            methods instead of principles are more likely to cause
                                            differences of opinion, public opinion is formed
                                            differently.) For example, in Japan the pro-Axis
                                            elements gained power following last year’s German
                                            victories in Western Europe; then Japanese doubt of
                                            ultimate German victory was created by Germany’s failure
                                            to invade the British Isles, this factor helping to
                                            reinforce the moderate elements; and finally Germany’s
                                            attack on the Soviet Union upset the expectation of
                                            continued Russo-German peace and made the Japanese
                                            realize that those who took Japan into the Tripartite
                                            Alliance had misled Japan.</item>

                                        <item>The Embassy in Japan has never been convinced by the
                                            theory that Japan’s collapse as a militaristic power
                                            would shortly result from the depletion and the eventual
                                            exhaustion of Japan’s financial and economic resources,
                                            as propounded by many leading American economists. Such
                                            forecasts were unconsciously based upon the assumption
                                            that a dominant consideration would be Japan’s retention
                                            of the capitalistic system. The outcome they predicted
                                            has not transpired, although it is true that the greater
                                            part of Japan’s commerce has been lost, Japanese
                                            industrial production has been drastically curtailed,
                                            and Japan’s national resources have been depleted. <pb

                                            has been a drastic prosecution of the process to

                                            and imposition of a blockade (proposed by some) can best

                                    conciliation with the United States. If these efforts fail, the
                                    Ambassador foresees a probable swing of the pendulum in Japan
                                    once more back to the former Japanese position or even farther.
                                    This would lead to what he has described as an all-out,
                                    do-or-die attempt, actually risking national hara-kiri, to make
                                    Japan impervious to economic embargoes abroad rather than to
                                    yield to foreign pressure. It is realized by observers who feel
                                    Japanese national temper and psychology from day to day that,
                                    beyond peradventure, this contingency not only is possible but
                                    is probable.</item>

                                <item>If the fiber and temper of the Japanese people are kept in
                                    mind, the view that war probably would be averted, though there
                                    might be some risk of war, by progressively imposing drastic
                                    economic measures is an uncertain and dangerous hypothesis upon
                                    which to base considered United States policy and measures. War
                                    would not be averted by such a course, if it is taken, in the
                                    opinion of the Embassy. However, each view is only opinion, and,
                                    accordingly, to postulate the correctness of either one and to
                                    erect a definitive policy thereon would, in the belief of the
                                    Embassy, be contrary to American national interests. It would
                                    mean putting the cart before the horse. The primary point to be
                                    decided apparently involves the question whether war with Japan
                                    is justified by American national objectives, policies, and
                                    needs in the case of failure of the first line of national
                                    defense, namely, diplomacy, since it would be possible only on
                                    the basis of such a decision for the Roosevelt administration to
                                    follow a course which would be divested as much as possible of
                                    elements of uncertainty, speculation, and opinion. The
                                    Ambassador does not doubt that such a decision, irrevocable as
                                    it might well prove to <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0770"

                                <item>The Ambassador emphasizes that, in the above discussion of
                                    this grave, momentous subject, he is out of touch with the
                                    intentions and thoughts of the Administration thereon, and he
                                    does not at all mean to imply that Washingon is pursuing an
                                    undeliberated policy. Nor does he intend to advocate for a
                                    single moment any “appeasement” of Japan by the United States or
                                    recession in the slightest degree by the United States
                                    Government from the fundamental principles laid down as a basis
                                    for the conduct and adjustment of international relations,
                                    American relations with Japan included. There should be no
                                    compromise with principles, though methods may be flexible. The
                                    Ambassador’s purpose is only to ensure against the United States
                                    becoming involved in war with Japan because of any possible
                                    misconception of Japan’s capacity to rush headlong into a
                                    suicidal struggle with the United States. While national sanity
                                    dictates against such action, Japanese sanity cannot be measured
                                    by American standards of logic. The Ambassador sees no need for
                                    much anxiety respecting the bellicose tone and substance at
                                    present of the Japanese press (which in the past several years
                                    has attacked the United States intensely in recurrent waves),
                                    but he points out the shortsightedness of underestimating
                                    Japan’s obvious preparations to implement an alternative program
                                    in the event the peace program fails. He adds that similarly it
                                    would be shortsighted for American policy to be based upon the
                                    belief that Japanese preparations are no more than saber
                                    rattling, merely intended to give moral support to the high
                                    pressure diplomacy of Japan. Action by Japan which might render
                                    unavoidable an armed conflict with the United States may come
                                    with dangerous and dramatic suddenness.</item>

                            evening. He said that he has been studying the official papers in

                            told, only yesterday, of the Foreign Minister’s desire that he proceed
                            to Washington. Mr. Kurusu informed me that he is going simply to help
                            the Japanese Ambassador in the present difficult situation by bringing a

                        <p>I received a visit today from a leading Japanese<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d381fn40">“A leading Japanese and reliable
                                Informant.”</note> who maintains close contacts with the present
                            government and who said he was calling at the request of Mr. Togo, the
                            Foreign Minister. My informant told me that inasmuch as the Foreign
                            Minister felt he could not express himself to me with the freedom which
                            he desired, he was taking this means of sending me indirectly a
                            suggestion along the following lines: The Tojo government has decided
                            the limits to which it will be possible to go in an endeavor to meet the
                            desires of the United States, but nevertheless should these concessions
                            be regarded as inadequate by the Government of the United States it is
                            of the highest importance that the Washington conversations be continued
                            and not permitted to break down.</p>
                        <p>My informant then went on to express what he declared were his own
                            personal opinions but which may or may not reflect the opinions of the
                            Foreign Minister. He stated that if the present situation which was
                            having a calamitous effect upon Japan were continued, the Japanese
                            Government in the course of time would be compelled to agree to accept
                            the views of the United States if only in order to prevent the breakdown
                            of the conversations in Washington. I told my informant, and requested
                            him to pass it on to Mr. Togo, that the present bellicose and violent
                            tone of the Japanese press in regard to the United States, such as in
                            particular the editorial published in the <hi rend="italic">Japan Times
                                and Advertiser</hi> on November 5 and the article in the evening <hi

                            view of public opinion in the United States which naturally regards
                            these truculent articles, and especially those of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Japan Times and Advertiser</hi>
                            <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0772"/>which is known to express the
                            attitudes of the Japanese Foreign Office, as accurately reflecting the
                            opinion of the Japanese Government. My informant promised to repeat my
                            observations to Mr. Togo and to draw his attention to the articles in
                            question.</p>
                        <p>My informant said that too much attention should not be paid to Japanese
                            newspapers and added metaphorically that frightened dogs bark and the
                            greater the fright the louder the bark, and that at present the military
                            party in Japan are frightened by the prospects opening up before them.
                            He went on to say that it is a mistake for the United States to regard
                            the Japanese as adults. In reality they are children and should be
                            treated accordingly. Their confidence can be gained by a friendly
                            gesture or word. The Germans have correctly diagnosed this aspect of
                            Japanese psychology and have utilized it successfully.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion my informant again urged that irrespective of future
                            developments the Washington conversations must not be permitted to break
                            down since in such an event he was fearful of some drastic and fateful
                            results.</p>

                            with our discussions with the Japanese Government. He said that various
                            people keep coming to him, refer to these reports and then ask how this
                            Government can expect to improve relations with Japan in view of a

                            sought to talk with the Secretary as he had had no definite instructions
                            and as he consequently did not wish to take up the Secretary’s time. He
                            said that he had now received instructions <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707"
                                facs="0773"/>and that in accordance therewith he desired to resume
                            the conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the new Cabinet in Japan had deliberated very
                            carefully upon the various provisions of a proposed settlement between
                            our two Governments and had examined very carefully our draft of June 21
                            with a view to making the utmost concessions that they could make,
                            having due regard for the situation in the Far East and of the attitude
                            of public opinion in Japan. He referred to the three principal questions
                            on which our respective views had diverged and he said that, with regard
                            to two of those questions, namely, Japan’s obligations under the
                            Tripartite Pact and nondiscrimination in international commercial
                            relations, he thought that it would not be difficult to reconcile our
                            views. In regard to the question of the desire of the Japanese
                            Government to retain for some time a certain number of troops in north
                            China and Inner Mongolia, he said he realized that difficulties of
                            reaching an agreement were greater.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then went on to say that in view of the gravity of the
                            situation he was very conscious of his responsibility and in order to
                            minimize the possibility of any blunder on his part he had asked the
                            Japanese Government for the assistance of an experienced diplomatist and
                            that in accordance with his request the Government was sending Mr.
                            Kurusu to assist him. The Ambassador expressed the hope that in view of
                            Mr. Kurusu’s personal ambassadorial rank the President would receive Mr.
                            Kurusu.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed the Secretary a document, copy of which is
                                attached,<note n="43" xml:id="d382fn43"><hi rend="italic"

                        <p rend="flushleft">The Secretary glanced over the document and inquired
                            what proportion of the Japanese troops now in China Japan would propose
                            to retain there. The Japanese Ambassador replied that, as the Secretary
                            was aware, Japan already had the right under the Boxer Protocol to
                            station troops in the Peiping and Tientsin areas; that as the Soviets
                            had troops in Outer Mongolia the stationing of Japanese troops in Inner
                            Mongolia was desired as an “equipoise” to those troops. The Ambassador,
                            without making any direct reply to the Secretary’s specific question,
                            went on to refer to armed forces maintained by other countries in China
                            and he said also that when Chiang <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708"
                                facs="0774"/>Kai-shek first entered Shanghai<note n="44"
                                xml:id="d382fn44">In March 1927.</note> the British had asked the
                            Japanese to take joint action with them at Shanghai, but that the
                            Japanese had declined to do so. He said that notwithstanding the
                            moderate attitude of the Japanese, the Japanese soon thereafter became
                            the object of a bitter Chinese boycott campaign.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, although he had told the Chinese Ambassador that
                            we were having exploratory conversations with the Japanese, he had not
                            acquainted the Chinese Ambassador with any of the substance of the
                            points we were discussing. He then recalled to the Japanese Ambassador
                            that, as he had on numerous occasions said to the Japanese Ambassador,
                            we proposed before entering into any formal negotiations to discuss the
                            matter with the Chinese and the British and the Dutch. The Secretary
                            said that an idea had just occurred to him which he had so far discussed
                            with no one, namely, supposing the Chinese were now to say that they
                            desired a real friendship with Japan and would do everything in their
                            power to work together along peaceful ways, would not this be a
                            wonderful opportunity for Japan to launch forth on a real new order, an
                            order in which Japan would gain her real moral leadership in the Far
                            East? At a time when Hitler was leading his people over a precipice and
                            when Europe was threatened with anarchy, would not the adoption by Japan
                            of a new policy of conciliation and friendship with China not maintained
                            at a sword’s point provide Japan with a real opportunity for progressive
                            leadership in which Japan and the United States could cooperate to save
                            the world? The Ambassador and Mr. Wakasugi appeared to be very much
                            impressed with this suggestion and said that they would refer it to
                            their Government for its consideration. The Ambassador said that he was
                            personally convinced of the wisdom of the Secretary’s policies and that
                            when he went back to Japan and retired he would use his influence in a
                            direction away from outmoded ideas such as would call for the retention
                            of Japanese troops in China. The Secretary reviewed again the advantages
                            which this Government had derived from renouncing its previous policies
                            of stationing armed forces in Latin-American countries. He mentioned the
                            great increase that had taken place in United States trade with those
                            countries. He expressed the conviction that if Japan should adopt a
                            broad-gauge liberal policy in relation to China Japan would derive
                            incalculable advantage in the way of trade and prosperity.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the question of Japan’s relations to the Axis powers,
                            the Secretary expressed the hope that some concrete statement could be
                            worked out which would help us. The Ambassador expressed the view that,
                            considering the attitude of the Japanese Government <pb n="709"
                                xml:id="pg_709" facs="0775"/>which manifestly desired to maintain
                            peace in the Pacific area, it did not seem to him that any further
                            statement was necessary than had already been made. The Secretary
                            pointed out that such manifestations of the attitude of the present
                            Japanese Cabinet might not cover the situation should some new
                            government come into power in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the hope that, in view of the urgency of the
                            matter, as the Japanese Government considered the situation critical at
                            home, we would expedite our study of the document which the Ambassador
                            had left with us. The Ambassador added that he had been instructed to
                            present his views to the President and asked the Secretary if he would
                            be so kind as to arrange an appointment. The Ambassador said that he
                            would not take up much of the President’s time but would present him
                            with a written document in order to conserve the President’s time. The
                            Secretary said that he would be glad to comply with the Ambassador’s
                            request. He asked the Ambassador whether the document which the
                            Ambassador had presented was to be taken in conjunction with the
                            previous documents which had been exchanged. The Ambassador replied in
                            the affirmative. The Ambassador said that there was our document of June
                            21 and their document of September 25. The Secretary added “and our
                            document of October 2”.</p>

                            which he had had with me on October 30, when he said that he was firmly
                            of the opinion that the maintenance of friendly relations between the
                            United States and Japan was a practicable proposition. He went on to say
                            that he had given constant thought to this matter and that he had
                            determined to put forward every effort to re-establish relations between
                            the two countries on a friendly basis and to maintain peace in the
                            Pacific. It was the purpose of the present Cabinet to continue with the
                            project of establishing a “Greater East Asia” as a contribution toward
                            world peace. Mr. Togo said that ever since he has assumed office he had
                            been intensively studying the documents relating to the conversations
                            which have thus far taken place. Fresh proposals had been formulated and
                            had been sent to Admiral Nomura, who had been instructed to enter into
                            negotiations with the President and the Secretary of State. I
                            interrupted the Foreign Minister to say that our Government had been
                            careful to emphasize that it was engaged in “preliminary and exploratory
                            conversations” with the Japanese Government. Mr. Togo replied that he
                            was well aware of that fact, but that he wondered whether the time had
                            not come to enter into formal and official negotiations. However, he
                            said that he did not wish to press the point.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_711" facs="0777"/>the conversations. He recalled in this
                            connection that he had asked me to facilitate Mr. Kurusu’s journey to
                            the United States, and that the American Government and I had responded
                            in a manner which was most gratifying. He said that it was everywhere
                            known in Japan that I had striven to promote friendly relations between
                            our two countries and that my efforts in this regard were highly
                            appreciated throughout the country. He intended on his part to spare no
                            effort to cooperate with me with a view to opening up a way for the
                            solution of the problems confronting the two countries which would be
                            mutually acceptable.</p>
                        <p>What he most keenly felt, the Foreign Minister continued, from reviewing
                            the documents recording conversations which have thus far taken place
                            was that the knowledge and appreciation of the United States with regard
                            to the realities of the situation in the Far East are unfortunately
                            inadequate. Although Mr. Hull had admitted that Japan is a stabilizing
                            force in the Far East, the position taken by the United States
                            throughout the conversations had not been in harmony with that fact.
                            Unless the American Government should take full cognizance of the fact
                            that Japan has been engaged in hostilities with China for four and a
                            half years, then the admission of Japan’s being a stabilizing force in
                            the Far East would have in actuality no meaning. Mr. Togo said that Mr.
                            Hull, in a conversation with Mr. Wakasugi on October 16, recalled that
                            he had told former Ambassador Saito that he recognized Japan as a
                            stabilizing force and would be prepared to express such recognition in
                            an official manner.<note n="45a" xml:id="d384fn45a">But see memorandum
                                by the Secretary of State of conversation, <ref target="#pg_687">p.
                                    687</ref>.</note> The Minister went on to say that the
                            population of this country is steadily and rapidly increasing; it was
                            now about one hundred million; and it was necessary to assure raw
                            materials necessary for their existence. It was his opinion that unless
                            the American Government realizes this fact as among the realities of the
                            situation, successful conclusion to the conversations would be
                            difficult. During the conversations carried on for a period of more than
                            six months, the Japanese Government had repeatedly made proposals
                            calculated to approach the American point of view, but the American
                            Government for its part had taken no step toward meeting the Japanese
                            position and had yielded nothing—it had perhaps taken a more advanced
                            position. Those being the facts, “we in Japan are led to wonder what is
                            the degree of sincerity of the American Government in continuing with
                            the conversations.” He said that national sentiment will not tolerate
                            further protracted delay in arriving at some conclusion. Referring to
                            the fact that the Diet is shortly to meet, he emphasized that the
                            position is daily becoming more pressing. He expressed the hope that the
                            American Government would take <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0778"
                            />a statesmanlike position and view the problems to be resolved from the
                            broadest possible viewpoint—that it would try to settle these problems
                            “with one sweep”. It was his opinion that otherwise the prospects of
                            overcoming the present difficulties would be small.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister went on to say that Japan had already made what were
                            believed to have been the greatest possible concessions. However, the
                            position had been examined by the new Cabinet and the new proposal now
                            being made comprises the maximum possible concessions by Japan. The
                            Minister at this point handed me two pieces of paper (attached
                                hereto)<note n="46" xml:id="d384fn46">For texts, see document handed

                            proposals, and he said that he wished to make two observations as

                                    modifications to meet as far as possible the American position

                                <item>The Japanese draft of September 25 was largely based on the
                                    American draft of June 21. In the Foreign Minister’s opinion it
                                    contains many unsatisfactory features with regard to both text
                                    and substance. However, to expedite the conversations, the
                                    Minister had decided to make use of that draft as a basis for a
                                    fresh start. He reiterated that this new proposal includes the
                                    maximum concessions.</item>

                                    notwithstanding grave domestic difficulties, made a further and
                                    what must be regarded as the maximum possible concession. The
                                    Japanese Government believes that the American Government will
                                    appreciate this further manifestation of Japan’s desire to come
                                    to an amicable settlement with the United States:</item>

                                <item>Mr. Hull has intimated that he has already consulted the
                                    British Government with regard to the conversations and that he
                                    proposes to continue such consultation. British interests in the
                                    Far East are admittedly large and would be deeply affected by
                                    matters now under discussions between the United States and
                                    Japan. The Foreign Minister regards it as necessary that in the

                                    expressed the hope that the American Government will persuade
                                    the British Government to agree to such simultaneous

                        <p>The Minister concluded his observations by repeating that he solicited my
                            cooperation to bring about a speedy and satisfactory end to the
                            negotiations. He referred to the question of conversations being carried
                            on in Tokyo paralleling those taking place in Washington, which was
                            touched on at our last meeting. The Minister said that he had no
                            intention of merely duplicating here what would be said in Washington.
                            He believed that there would be no objection on the part of the American
                            Government to holding parallel conversations in Tokyo, but in his view
                            such parallel conversations should be designed to supplement exchanges
                            in Washington of information and of opinion with a view to expediting
                            the progress of the conversations.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the Minister’s presentation I said that I had no authority
                            to debate the questions approached by the Minister which would be
                            discussed in Washington but that I wished to raise three points as
                            pertinent to those discussions, as follows: <list>

                                    American Government had been given a perfectly clear conception
                                    of the situation and its various factors by this Embassy and, I

                                <item>The Minister’s observation that Japan must have access to
                                    necessary supplies penetrates to the center of the whole problem
                                    since one of the fundamental purposes of the current
                                    conversations is to open a way for Japan to obtain such
                                    necessary supplies, together with a free flow of trade and
                                    commerce and markets for her industries, but by peaceful means
                                    as opposed to the use of force, and that Mr. Hull’s program
                                    visualizes precisely these desiderata which are aimed to ensure
                                    Japan’s future welfare, prosperity and contentment.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister remarked that he was quite prepared to admit that
                            the Embassy is endeavoring to report accurately on the situation in the
                            Far East, but that, in view of the position which is being taken by the
                            American Government, he wondered whether the American Government has in
                            fact a correct appreciation of the realities. To illustrate his point,
                            he wished to cite the question of the stationing of Soviet troops in
                            Outer Mongolia, which was universally recognized to be a part of China.
                            So far as he knew no one had objected to the presence of Soviet troops
                            in Outer Mongolia. With regard to my comment on the phrase “stabilizing
                            force in East Asia,” the Foreign Minister said that there should be a
                            satisfactory interpretation <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0780"/>of
                            that phrase from a common-sense point of view. With regard to my
                            observations on the question of assuring to Japan sources of raw
                            materials the Foreign Minister said that this was a question which had
                            been debated over a period of years at Geneva and elsewhere. He did not
                            wish to go into the fundamentals of the question, but he thought that he
                            could advert briefly to the importance of commercial and economic
                            relations between the United States and Japan. The freezing by the
                            United States of Japanese assets had stopped supplies of many important
                            raw materials to Japan. Economic pressure of this character is capable
                            of menacing national existence to a greater degree than the direct use
                            of force. He hoped that the American Government would take into
                            consideration circumstances of this character and realize the
                            possibility that the Japanese people, if exposed to continued economic
                            pressure, might eventually feel obliged resolutely to resort to measures
                            of self-defense.</p>
                        <p>The Minister went on to say that Japan had been engaged in extensive
                            hostilities for a period of more than four years, and that if Japan were
                            called upon to sacrifice the fruits of such protracted hostilities she
                            must inevitably collapse. If the American Government realizes this fact
                            a speedy conclusion to the conversations will be easy.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out the apparent inconsistency between the Minister’s emphasis
                            on the insistence of Japan that she retain the fruits of hostilities and
                            Japan’s acceptance of the principle of refraining from aggression and
                            the use of force.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that Japan is not conducting a war of
                            aggression and that therefore no question arises of her retaining the
                            fruits of aggression. It is his impression that the American Government
                            is now resorting, under the plea of self-defense, to measures over and
                            beyond those that are generally recognized by international law. He
                            expressed the opinion that it might not be out of place for Japan to ask
                            the United States not to put too liberal a construction on the principle
                            of self-defense. In any event, it was his opinion that theoretical
                            discussions would not promote the conversations, which he thought should
                            be pursued along realistic lines.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to another matter which is covered by a
                            separate memorandum.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador, accompanied by Minister Wakasugi, called on the
                            President. The Secretary of State was present at the express wish of
                            President Roosevelt. The Ambassador, after a few preliminary remarks,
                            proceeded to read as under instruction from his Government the following
                            communication: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    proposals which my Government has instructed me to submit to
                                    your Government. As you will recall, it was on the 25th of
                                    September that the Japanese Government, last made its proposals
                                    to the United States Government, and, gathering from the
                                    observations which the Secretary of State made on them on the
                                    2nd of October and also from the views which were subsequently
                                    expressed by the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of
                                    State Mr. Welles, the greatest difficulties arose from three
                                    points, that is:— <list>

                                <p>“In regard to the first question, that is, the principle of
                                    non-discrimination, my Government has now decided to accept its
                                    application in all the Pacific areas, including China, as your
                                    Government desires, on the understanding that the principle is
                                    to be applied uniformly to the rest of the world as well. The
                                    Secretary of State has repeatedly pointed out to me that it has
                                    been his long-cherished scheme to see the application of the
                                    principle throughout the whole world. I therefore hope that the
                                    assurance to be given by my Government in this connection will
                                    be gratifying to you.</p>
                                <p>“As to the second question, the attitude of our two Governments
                                    toward the European war, my Government proposed, in the draft of
                                    September 25th, that <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p rend="flushleft">‘both Governments will be guided in
                                            their conduct by considerations of protection and
                                            self-defense.’</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p rend="flushleft">In this connection I have to inquire if the
                                    United States Government is in a position to give an assurance
                                    that it has no intention of placing too liberal an
                                    interpretation on the term ‘protection and self-defense’ that
                                    may lead to an abuse of the recognized right based upon it. The
                                    Japanese Government would be ready to give a similar assurance
                                    on the basis of reciprocity, that is, if the assurance is
                                    forthcoming from the United States Government.</p>
                                <p>“In the draft of September 25th referred to, my Government
                                    proposed that <quote rend="blockquote">

                                            entirely independently in the matter of interpretation
                                            of the <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0782"

                                            would likewise determine what actions might be taken by
                                            way of fulfilling the obligations in accordance with the
                                            said interpretation.’</p>

                                <p rend="flushleft">It will hardly be necessary to point out in this
                                    connection that the fundamental motive for initiating the
                                    present conversations was the preservation of peace in the
                                    Pacific by all possible means. The present circumstances under
                                    which Japan is placed do not permit my Government to go any
                                    further to write in black and white than what it proposed in the
                                    draft of September 25th which I have just quoted. <del

                                    great deal further than it went previously in that the formula

                                    will readily agree that, while complete and immediate withdrawal

                                    on it, but the conversations dragged on and on and, on the other
                                    hand, the relations between our two countries became more and
                                    more strained, the people of my country becoming more and more
                                    impatient.</p>
                                <p>“As viewed from the Japanese side, the Japanese Government has
                                    made not a few concessions in its assertion at various stages
                                    while the United States Government has, it seemed to the
                                    Japanese, remained adamant on its contention and has shown
                                    little sign of reciprocation, and thus I must frankly inform you
                                    that in certain quarters in my country some skepticism has
                                    arisen as to the true intention of the United States Government.
                                    Personally I do not like to say it, but it is true. People in my
                                    country take the freezing of the assets as an economic blockade
                                    and they go even so far as to contend that the means of modern
                                    warfare are not limited to shooting. No nation can live without
                                    the supply of materials vital to its industries. Reports
                                    reaching me from home indicate that the situation is serious and
                                    pressing and the only way of preserving peace is to reach some
                                    kind of amicable and satisfactory understanding with the United
                                    States without any unnecessary loss of time. In the face of
                                    these mounting difficulties, the Japanese Government bent all
                                    its efforts to continue the conversations and bring about a
                                    satisfactory understanding solely for the purpose of maintaining
                                    peace in the Pacific. My Government therefore is now submitting
                                    certain proposals as its utmost effort for that purpose, and I
                                    shall feel very grateful if I can have the views of your
                                    Government on them at the earliest possible opportunity. Suppose
                                    we come to an understanding with this country, the psychological
                                    effect of it upon our people will mean much more than what is
                                    actually written upon the paper, and the policy of our
                                    Government will necessarily be guided and dictated thereby. I
                                    confidently hope that the views and desires entertained by the
                                    Japanese Government are fully shared and reciprocated by your
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>“I may add for your information that in view of the serious
                                    situation now prevailing in the relations between our two
                                    countries, the Japanese Government is sending over here
                                    Ambassador Kurusu to assist me in the present conversations and
                                    also that the conversations will be taken up by Foreign Minister
                                    Togo with Ambassador Grew in Tokio in a parallel line.</p>
                                <p>“I am afraid I may have used to-day some words which a trained
                                    diplomat must not use, but I hope you will kindly forgive my
                                    transgression, for it was only because of my earnest wish to
                                    keep and direct the relations of our two countries in the course
                                    which I believe is best for both of us.”</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">The Ambassador appeared very much in earnest in reading
                            the statement.</p>
                        <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0784"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador made some reference to commercial policy as discussed and
                            proclaimed by the President and Prime Minister Churchill at their sea
                            conference some months ago. He referred complainingly to the fact that
                            the Japanese went into Shantung and were only allowed to remain there
                            some six years, at the end of which time they were requested to move out
                            their troops.</p>
                        <p>The President then read the following oral statement in reply: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The entire world has been placed in a precarious position as a
                                    result of the havoc which has been wrought by the forces of
                                    aggression. Our common sense tells us of the extreme need that
                                    the world come back to ways of peace. It is the purpose of this
                                    Government to do its best in the spirit of fair play to
                                    contribute to establishing a basis for peace, stability, and
                                    order in the Pacific area. As a means of achieving these
                                    objectives it is essential that emphasis be laid upon giving
                                    practical effect to a sound philosophy of human welfare. We have
                                    often and quite recently made clear publicly what we have in
                                    mind in this regard. We hope that our exploratory conversations
                                    will achieve favorable results in the way of providing a basis
                                    for negotiations. We shall continue to do our best to expedite
                                    the conversations just as we understand that the Japanese
                                    Government is anxious to do. We hope that the Japanese
                                    Government will make it clear that it intends to pursue peaceful
                                    courses instead of opposite courses, as such clarification
                                    should afford a way for arriving at the results which we
                                    seek.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The President also referred orally to his opinion that nations must think
                            one hundred years ahead, especially during the age through which the
                            world is passing, and that the Chinese Government for the past thirty
                            years has been passing through a new experience. He referred to
                            extraterritorial courts and other unusual conditions that had
                            accompanied this new experience of China. If I understood the Ambassador
                            correctly, he said it took three years to develop and dispose of the
                            Shantung problems. The President thereupon replied that the Ambassador,
                            Secretary Hull and himself had only consumed some six months in
                            discussing a solution of our relations and those of other countries in
                            the Pacific and that patience was necessary. The President spoke of a
                                <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> as being not merely an
                            expedient and temporary agreement, but also one which takes into account
                            actual human existence. The Ambassador dwelt briefly again on the
                            question of the Japanese getting out of China by degrees and adding that
                            there would be no annexation, no indemnity, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>There was nothing said about when the next conversation would take place.
                            The President brought up his program to visit Warm Springs at the end of
                            this week for some ten days. The Ambassador said that Kurusu would be
                            here about Saturday.<note n="47a" xml:id="d385fn47a">November 15,
                                1941.</note> The President said that, of course, he expected to see
                            Kurusu and confer with the <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0785"
                            />Ambassador and the Minister and their associates. The Ambassador said
                            that Kurusu was only coming to assist him and coming at his request and
                            that he did not have anything new to bring so far as the Ambassador
                            knew.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi, Japanese Minister, called by appointment made at his
                            request. Mr. Wakasugi said that the Japanese Ambassador had it in mind
                            this morning to say something to the Secretary which he did not have an
                            opportunity to say because of an interruption and the Japanese
                            Ambassador therefore desired to have an appointment to see the Secretary
                            either this evening or tomorrow morning to take up with the Secretary
                            two points. The first point related to the desire of the Japanese
                            Government to hasten the conversations in view of the pressing situation
                            in Japan and the forthcoming Diet session. The second point related to
                            the suggestion which the Secretary made on November 7 in regard to means
                            for the development on the basis of mutual pledges by China and Japan of
                            a new relationship of conciliation and friendship. Mr. Wakasugi said
                            that the Ambassador had communicated to the Japanese Government the
                            Secretary’s comments on this point, that the Japanese Government had
                            replied that it was very much interested in this suggestion and wondered
                            if it would be possible for the Secretary to develop more fully just
                            what he had in mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine said that after consulting with the Secretary he would
                            communicate again with Mr. Wakasugi.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Kase<note n="47b" xml:id="d387fn47b">Chief of the First Section,
                                American Bureau of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                            called this morning at the request of Mr. Togo to say that while the
                            Foreign Minister of necessity could not with entire freedom tell me
                            certain things directly, he regarded it as of great importance that the
                            Government of the United States should have in mind a completely clear
                            understanding of the situation in this country in so far as it affects
                            the present endeavors of the Japanese Government <pb n="720"
                                xml:id="pg_720" facs="0786"/>to reach a settlement of the relations
                            with the United States and for this reason the Minister had asked Mr.
                            Kase to convey to me the following.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Togo had been “shocked” (a term which Mr. Kase later changed to
                            “concerned”) to receive the impression from the latest reports of the
                            Japanese Ambassador in Washington of his talks with the President and
                            the Secretary of State that the Government of the United States does not
                            fully grasp the urgency of successfully concluding the current
                            conversations in the shortest possible time. Mr. Kase told me that not
                            only does Mr. Togo consider that the preliminary conversations have now
                            entered the stage of negotiation but also that he considers that these
                            negotiations have now reached their final stage since the Japanese
                            Government has already made the greatest possible concessions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kase then went on to say that the last government of Prince Konoye
                            had conducted the conversations with the support of the country as a
                            whole but that the long period of time which had elapsed since their
                            inception without any clear indications of progress had given rise to
                            the opinion in Japan that the Government of the United States was
                            endeavoring to utilize the conversations as a means of concealing the
                            preparations which it was carrying on to complete the encirclement of
                            Japan. While the present Cabinet does not agree with this opinion,
                            however, it has undertaken its present task of reaching an agreement
                            with the United States against a considerable body of opposition and,
                            although despite this opposition it has had the courage to embark on its
                            present efforts and is according its unanimous support to the Foreign
                            Minister in this respect, a very critical and dangerous state of affairs
                            will result should any appreciable delay be encountered in successfully
                            concluding the negotiations. Those elements who are opposed to a
                            continuance of efforts to reach an adjustment with the United States
                            will seize upon any such delay as evidence of the correctness of “their
                            views. Mr. Kase was emphatic in his statement that his remarks in this
                            connection contained no implication of threat whatsoever and should not
                            be so regarded, but should be taken only as a factual statement. Mr.
                            Kase added that Mr. Togo entirely realizes that his own life is at
                            stake, to say nothing of his official position, but that nevertheless he
                            has had the courage to make this final attempt in full cognizance of the
                            consequences of failure.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Kase that his observations were virtually the same both in
                            general and in particular as those which had been made to me during the
                            last Konoye Cabinet both by Admiral Toyoda and by Prince Konoye himself
                            and which of course had been reported in full to my Government. Mr. Kase
                            replied that there was a considerable difference <pb n="721"
                                xml:id="pg_721" facs="0787"/>between the present situation and that
                            which had obtained previously, and he again emphasized the vital
                            importance of concluding the negotiations without further delay and
                            reiterated his previous statement that the Japanese Government
                            considered that the final stage of the negotiations had already
                            begun.</p>
                        <p>At this point I permitted Mr. Kase to read the Department’s telegram No.
                            728, November 8, 8 p.m.,<note n="48" xml:id="d387fn48">Not printed; see
                                memorandum of November 7, 1941, <ref target="#pg_706">p.

                            Admiral Nomura on November 7. After reading the telegram Mr. Kase said
                            that the account of the conversation contained therein followed very
                            closely Admiral Nomura’s report. He added that Mr. Togo had taken
                            especial note of the suggestion of the Secretary contained in paragraph
                            eight of the Department’s telegram concerning an expression on the part
                            of China of its desire to establish genuinely friendly relations with
                            Japan and the readiness of the Chinese Government to make every effort
                            toward peaceful cooperation with Japan. Mr. Togo was now wondering how
                            this suggestion might be put into actual effect. I told Mr. Kase that,
                            since the point would seem to me to be directly linked with the general
                            program which Mr. Hull envisages for an adjustment of the whole Pacific
                            problem, the Japanese Ambassador might care to discuss the suggestion
                            fully with the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kase then inquired if I had received an account of the conversation
                            on November 10 between the President and the Japanese Ambassador, to
                            which I replied that I had not, adding that the failure of the
                            Department to send me a report probably meant that there had been little
                            difference between the conversation on November 10 with the President
                            and that of the Ambassador with the Secretary of State on November 7.
                            Mr. Kase said that the tenor of the two conversations had been
                            different, to which I replied that I should then probably in due time
                            receive an account of the conversation with the President on November
                            10.</p>
                        <p>I then allowed Mr. Kase to read my telegram No. 1782, November 10, 8
                                p.m.,<note n="49" xml:id="d387fn49">Not printed; see memorandum by

                            that date. Mr. Kase said that with the exception of the last sentence in
                            paragraph one the account was completely accurate. With reference to the
                            sentence in question Mr. Kase said that it was not his recollection that
                            Mr. Togo had stated that “he did not wish to press the point” regarding
                            the transference of the conversations into “negotiations”, particularly
                            as Mr. Togo felt strongly that the vital stages of the actual
                            negotiations had begun. (According to Mr. Dooman, who was present at
                            that interview and who had noted down the Minister’s remarks, the latter
                            did make, in Japanese, the comment reported in my telegram <pb n="722"
                                xml:id="pg_722" facs="0788"/>referred to above, but quite likely
                            this observation did not appear in the official transcript made by Mr.
                            Kase as interpreter.)</p>

                        <p>My conversation with Mr. Kase casts doubt as to the credibility of the
                            alleged message which was passed on to me from the Foreign Minister by a
                            prominent Japanese on November 7, as reported in my telegram 1769,
                            November 7, 11 p.m., paragraph numbered one.<note n="50"
                                xml:id="d388fn50">Not printed; see memorandum by the Ambassador in

                            In view of my conversation today with Mr. Kase, it is possible that the
                            so-called message had been conveyed to me by my informant in somewhat
                            unclear and misleading form. At the time of its delivery it had struck
                            me as somewhat surprising, but as I had not yet at that time had my
                            first real interview with the Foreign Minister I had no grounds on which
                            to question its accuracy. Although it is possible that the alleged
                            message from my informant accurately reflected the Minister’s remarks,
                            which were to be conveyed to me in a purely personal fashion and were
                            not designed to form a part of the official record, even this
                            interpretation is subject to doubt. While it would appear obvious that a
                            continuation of the talks is greatly to be preferred to a complete
                            break-down, nonetheless for the conversations to drag on for a
                            considerable time with no definite progress being made in reconciling
                            the respective positions of the two Governments may well accelerate the
                            creation of the dangerous situation referred to in my various reports of
                            recent months, particularly in my 1736, November 3, 3 p.m. Although I
                            entirely realize that it is still up to Japan to provide the initiative
                            to make possible such progress in the conversations, I do not feel in a
                            position to state whether as asserted by the Japanese Government the
                            proposals which were submitted on November 7 to the Secretary constitute
                            the maximum Japanese concessions.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called in response to a request made by him on
                            November 10 at the Secretary’s apartment.<note n="51" xml:id="d389fn51"
                                >Mr. Wakasugi accompanied the Ambassador.</note> The Secretary
                            referred to the request which had been communicated to him by Mr.
                            Ballantine from the Japanese Minister for a further elaboration of <pb
                                n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0789"/>the Secretary’s views in regard
                            to the development of a real friendship between China and Japan, and he
                            said that in response to that request, he had prepared a statement which
                            he then proceeded to hand to the Japanese Ambassador.<note n="52"
                                xml:id="d389fn52"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the general position of this Government in
                            regard to a Pacific settlement had not changed and he assumed that
                            although a new ministry had been formed in Japan, the position of the
                            Japanese Government had not changed. He had said that with a view to
                            there being no misunderstanding, we had drawn up a recapitulation of
                            statements which the Japanese had given us in regard to their position,
                            and we would appreciate it if the Japanese Government could confirm that
                            our assumption was correct. The Secretary then handed the Japanese
                            Ambassador the statement which we had prepared on this subject.<note
                                n="53" xml:id="d389fn53"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                    target="#pg_727">p. 727</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that his new Government desired him to emphasize the
                            desire of the Japanese Government to expedite a settlement because the
                            internal situation in Japan was difficult, people becoming impatient and
                            a session of the Diet impending. He therefore hoped that within a week
                            or ten days some agreement could be reached. The Secretary commented
                            that we were working as rapidly as possible on the matters which the
                            Japanese Ambassador had presented to the President on November 10 and
                            suggested that it was our view that as soon as we reached a good basis
                            in our exploratory conversations, we could approach the Chinese
                            Government and sound out their attitude. In regard to commercial policy,
                            the Secretary said that there were points in the Japanese Government’s
                            proposal which we did not fully understand, and we assumed that what the
                            Japanese Government had in mind was the same as what we had in mind,
                            namely, to have Japan, Great Britain and other countries get together on
                            a basis of equality and fair treatment. The Secretary went on to say
                            that he expected much difficulty in explaining to the people here the
                            Tripartite alliance situation. The Ambassador replied that Japan’s
                            obligation under the Tripartite alliance was limited, that it was not an
                            offensive and defensive alliance, and that during the time of the
                            Anglo-Japanese alliance, Great Britain remained neutral during the war
                            between Japan and Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would like help in order to enable him to explain
                            Japan’s relationship to the Axis powers, for even though we understood
                            clearly the Ambassador’s attitude and that of the present Japanese
                            Cabinet, there must be considered the possibility of another Government
                            coming into power in Japan. The Secretary went on to point out the
                            increasing gravity of the situation in Europe and <pb n="724"
                                xml:id="pg_724" facs="0790"/>the growing distress of European
                            populations, which raised the question how long could Hitler keep those
                            populations crushed down. For this reason, he said, the time was
                            approaching for preparing for a post-war program, a matter in which he
                            felt that the Japanese Government must be interested. He suggested that
                            Japan would want to play a part in a constructive program to meet the
                            after-the-war situation, and that for this reason Japan would probably
                            not want to be tied in with Hitler. He noted that we are trying to keep
                            out of trouble and to that end are making efforts to unite peaceful
                            forces to avert disaster for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that he anticipated that as time went on Japan
                            would be less and less affected by the Axis ties, just as the importance
                            of the Anglo-Japanese alliance waned after the conclusion of the
                            Russo-Japanese war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that so many statements had been made about the
                            Tripartite Pact that it should be made clear if we are going to start
                            the world on the right course that we are going ahead on a basis of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said in reply that if the proposed agreement were made and
                            applied there would be no question of the use of force by Japan to gain
                            access to materials and markets which she desired.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the matter of the Tripartite Pact
                            relationship ought not to be a problem with Japan if we could work out
                            our proposed agreement in other ways.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether it was the Secretary’s idea that the United
                            States would leave to Japan and China to work out their peace terms by
                            themselves. The Secretary replied that we had not yet talked the subject
                            over with the Chinese or the British or Dutch, but we have told them
                            that if we get matters beyond an exploratory stage we should be glad to
                            talk with them. He added that we first want to have something
                            substantial to present to them and that he had said that if we reach a
                            stage of negotiations we will talk with the other Governments and will
                            then talk again with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Minister referred to the two documents which the Secretary
                            had handed the Ambassador and which both the Ambassador and the Minister
                            had just read. With regard to the document relating to mutual
                            conciliation between China and Japan, he asked what the Secretary had in
                            mind as to how the exchange of pledges would come about, as, for
                            example, whether it would be as a result [of] our bringing the Japanese
                            and Chinese together. The Secretary replied that when two neighbors have
                            not been on speaking terms, sometimes they make up as a result of an
                            initiative taken by one or the other and sometimes they are brought
                            together by a mutual friend. One cannot plan always in advance what each
                            of <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0791"/>a number of persons will in
                            succession do or say. He said he felt that the main thing now was to
                            dispose of basic matters in regard to the provisions of a peace
                            settlement and that questions of procedure could thereafter be more
                            satisfactorily settled. These points were gone over two or three times,
                            as the Japanese appeared to find difficulty in understanding them,
                            possibly because of a preconception that the Secretary’s suggestion
                            contained more than appeared on its face.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second document which related to the question of the
                            present Japanese Government’s general position on the question of peace,
                            the Minister said that we had referred to the Japanese Government’s
                            statement of August 28, whereas the Japanese Government had indicated
                            that it desired to use their September 25 document as the basis for
                            discussions. He said that, with reference to our statement that in
                            conversation with the Under Secretary he had expressed the willingness
                            of the Japanese Government to omit the qualifying phrases contained in
                            the assurances which we had quoted from the August 25 statement, this
                            was a misunderstanding on our part. He said that he was not referring to
                            the August 28 statement but to the September 25 statement and that what
                            he had said to the Under Secretary was that there might have been some
                            unfortunate phraseology in translation which could be improved after
                            comparison with the original Japanese text. He asked whether we would
                            withdraw what we had said in that connection.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would be glad to do so, and was glad to have the
                            Minister call attention to any misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that if the proposed agreement was held in abeyance
                            and the United States continued to aid Chiang Kai-shek while Japan was
                            negotiating with Chiang the Chinese would be certain to keep
                            negotiations dragging for an interminable period.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if we got the China matter started to move it
                            would soon gain momentum, for if Japan should propose terms which seem
                            reasonably fair everybody would want to get aboard. He felt sure that
                            ways could be found for safeguarding each other’s rights by
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that if we failed to reach an agreement simply
                            over an unwillingness on the part of China to agree to the Japanese
                            proposals in regard to troops, the situation would then be one in which
                            China held the key to future relations between Japan and the United
                            States which might result in war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that whether we exercised our good offices or
                            whether Japan approached China directly we felt that the nature of the
                            settlement which Japan reached with China was one which should be in
                            harmony with the proposed Pacific settlement as a whole. One <pb n="726"
                                xml:id="pg_726" facs="0792"/>of the principles, he said, upon which
                            we were proceeding was noninterference in the internal affairs of other
                            nations, and the permanent retention of troops of one country in another
                            country was inconsistent with that principle.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador disclaimed any desire on the part of Japan to station
                            troops in China permanently.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he felt that the same consideration applied to the
                            retention of Japanese troops in China indefinitely. The Ambassador
                            disclaimed any desire to keep troops in China indefinitely, but he did
                            not offer anything definite on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Minister repeated what the Ambassador had earlier said about
                            the desire of the Japanese Government to hear from us as soon as
                            possible in regard to the Japanese proposals. The Secretary replied that
                            we were working as hard as we could on the matter, and after consulting
                            with Mr. Ballantine, said that we hoped we could have something for them
                            day after tomorrow (November 14).</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the Japanese Ambassador’s request for any further
                            amplification that the Secretary of State might have in mind in
                            connection with the suggestion made by him in informal conversation on
                            November 7 in regard to mutual exchanges of pledges between China and
                            Japan for the establishment of real friendship and collaboration between
                            the two countries.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that the suggestion under reference was prompted by
                            the observation of the Japanese Ambassador that should the Japanese
                            Government agree to withdraw its troops within a definite period from
                            all areas of China the Japanese people would feel that they had nothing
                            to show for the four years and more of heavy sacrifice that they had
                            made and that such an agreement would be regarded as having caused Japan
                            a loss of prestige. The Secretary, in reply to the Japanese Ambassador’s
                            observation, commented that the present world crisis, in which Europe
                            finds itself threatened with anarchy, affords Japan a unique opportunity
                            to enhance its national prestige on a basis of moral force in a way that
                            military might could never accomplish. That is, if the Chinese
                            Government were now to say, either as a result of Japanese initiative or
                            on its own initiative, that China desired a real friendship with Japan
                            and would do everything it reasonably could to collaborate with Japan
                            along peaceful and mutually beneficial lines, could not Japan <pb
                                n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0793"/>find it possible to reciprocate
                            in a policy of mutual friendship and conciliation with China? Would not
                            such a policy enable Japan to make a contribution of inestimable value
                            toward arresting the destructive forces which now menace world
                            civilization and to assume a leadership in the world which every
                            peaceful nation would welcome.</p>
                        <p>What is envisaged would be an implementation of the kind of constructive,
                            liberal and peaceful world program concerning which we have been talking
                            in our exploratory conversations. That program contemplates practical
                            application of basic principles directed toward preservation of order
                            under law, peace with justice, and the social and economic welfare of
                            mankind. It contemplates peaceful collaboration among nations, mutual
                            respect for the rights of all, no aggrandisement, and the adopting of
                            broad-gauge economic policies which would provide liberalization of
                            trade, afford fair access to and development of natural resources and
                            raise living standards to the betterment of all peoples.</p>
                        <p>Full association by Japan in such a program at this critical moment in
                            world history would give Japan an undoubted position of moral leadership
                            and be a tribute to the far-sighted and enlightened character of its
                            statesmanship.</p>

                        <p>It will be recalled that the documents communicated by the Japanese
                            Ambassador to the President of the United States on August 28, 1941
                            contained a statement of the position of the Japanese Government in
                            regard to its desire and intention to pursue peaceful courses. That
                            position was set forth in excerpts taken from those, documents as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… Japan is solicitous for the maintenance of the peace of the
                                    Pacific and the peace of the world and she desires therefore to

                                <p>“… In consequence, the Japanese Government welcomes the
                                    invitation by the Government of the United States to an exchange
                                    of views in regard to basic policies and attitudes as the
                                    foundation of an understanding that will condition lasting and
                                    extensive peace in the Pacific area. For such peace, the
                                    Government of Japan is ready: for such a united effort toward a
                                    peaceful settlement covering the entire Pacific situation the
                                    Government of Japan, like the Government of the United States,
                                    would be proud to make sacrifices …”</p>

                        <p>With reference to the stationing of Japanese troops in Indochina, it was
                            stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… the Japanese Government has no intention of threatening

                        <p>With reference to the general program in view, it was stated: <quote

                                    the American Government and envisaged in the informal
                                    conversations as constituting a program for the Pacific area,
                                    the Japanese Government wishes to state that it considers these
                                    principles and the practical application thereof, in the
                                    friendliest manner possible, are the prime requisites of a true
                                    peace and should be applied not only in the Pacific area but
                                    throughout the entire world. Such a program has long been
                                    desired and sought by Japan itself …”</p>

                        <p>In as much as subsequent to the giving by the Japanese Government of the
                            foregoing statement of its position a new cabinet has come into office
                            in Japan, this Government believes that it would be helpful, in order to
                            avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding, if the Japanese
                            Government could at this time confirm that the position of the Japanese
                            Government has not changed.</p>
                        <p>This Government, in its statement to the Japanese Government of October
                            2, 1941, pointed out that, although we were gratified to receive the
                            statement of the position of the Japanese Government, we found it
                            difficult to understand the need for the qualification by <pb n="729"
                                xml:id="pg_729" facs="0795"/>the Japanese Government of its
                            statements of peaceful intent with what would seem to be unnecessary
                            qualifying phrases. We had in mind such phrases as: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As long as the Soviet Union remains faithful to the
                                    Soviets-Japanese neutrality treaty and does not menace Japan or
                                    Manchukuo or take any action contrary to the spirit of the said
                                    treaty.”</p>
                                <p>“Without provocation.”</p>
                                <p>“Without any justifiable reason.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On October 13 the Japanese Minister, in a conversation with the Under
                            Secretary of State, said that such qualifications were the result of
                            unfortunate phraseology and that the Japanese Government would be
                            willing to omit them. As this conversation took place before the present
                            Japanese Cabinet came into office, it is believed that it would be
                            helpful if the position of the Japanese Government on this point could
                            be clarified and the statement of the Japanese Minister be
                            confirmed.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing observations are not directed to the new proposals put
                            forward by the Japanese Ambassador on November 7 and November 10, but
                            are set forth merely in an effort to make abundantly clear the basis on
                            which we are proceeding in order that there may be avoided any
                            misunderstanding on the part either of the Japanese Government or of
                            this Government. It has not been and is not the purpose of this
                            Government to enter needlessly into a discussion of details. While
                            presenting these preliminary observations toward ensuring a common
                            understanding, this Government will expect to do everything it can to
                            expedite consideration of the latest proposals of the Japanese
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi called at his request. Mr. Wakasugi referred to the
                            President’s statement to the Ambassador that the President would be glad
                            to receive Mr. Kurusu and stated that the Embassy had received a
                            telegram from Mr. Kurusu dispatched from Midway stating that he was
                            arriving in Washington Saturday afternoon.<note n="54" xml:id="d392fn54"
                                >November 15, 1941.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi referred to his statement yesterday to the Secretary that
                            there had been a misunderstanding on our part as to what Wakasugi had
                            said to the Under Secretary on October 13 to which reference was made in
                            the oral statement handed the Japanese Ambassador <pb n="730"
                                xml:id="pg_730" facs="0796"/>yesterday. He said that what he had
                            said to Mr. Welles was: “There may be some unfortunate phraseology in
                            the English translation of our instructions as we are not very sure of
                            our English. If there are such phrases the wording might be adjusted.”
                            He said that he had the September 25 document in mind and not the
                            document of August 28 which was delivered while he was away in Japan. He
                            said that the Japanese Embassy had referred the contents of that
                            memorandum to the Japanese Government, deleting therefrom the last four
                            lines on page 3 and the first sentence beginning on page 4 through the
                            word “office” and the last two words in line 4 and all of line 5.</p>
                        <p>The Minister tried to impress upon Mr. Ballantine the pressing nature of
                            the situation in Japan as the public is becoming impatient and almost
                            desperate. The parliament is meeting Saturday and they hope for some
                            concrete understanding with the United States at once. He said he
                            understood yesterday that we were to give them an answer tomorrow. Mr.
                            Ballantine said that the Secretary had not said this, that what he had
                            said was that we hoped to be in a position to have ready to take up with
                            them some further matters tomorrow. Mr. Wakasugi said he hoped that the
                            Secretary could give the Ambassador tomorrow a clear-cut answer in black
                            and white as to whether the United States Government will accept or not
                            the Japanese proposal of September 25 as modified by their proposals of
                            November 7 and November 10 or whether we want to have some points
                            changed therein or whether our June 21 proposal is our final proposal.
                            He said that time is so pressing that the Japanese wanted to avoid any
                            further interchange of comments on their proposals. Mr. Ballantine said,
                            what are we going to do if we need further clarification as to the
                            intent of your proposals? He referred to the fact that the Secretary had
                            said yesterday that he did not understand what was meant by the latter
                            part of the Japanese proposal in regard to commercial policy. Mr.
                            Wakasugi said that what the Japanese Government meant by saying that
                            they would agree to non-discrimination as applied to China provided that
                            it will be made applicable to all the world was that the principle would
                            be applied by the United States and by Japan and did not refer to the
                            universal application of those principles by all countries. Mr.
                            Ballantine asked whether this was not a very important point to be
                            brought out clearly and authoritatively.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wakasugi then said that in all of our documents we had stated that we
                            were still in a stage of informal exploratory discussions whereas the
                            Japanese Government considered that we had now entered formal
                            negotiations especially since, on November 10, the <pb n="731"
                                xml:id="pg_731" facs="0797"/>Ambassador had formally presented as
                            under instruction a statement to the President. Mr. Ballantine said that
                            Mr. Wakasugi was fully aware of our position as mentioned again by the
                            Secretary yesterday, that we felt that when our talks had reached a
                            stage where we had something of substance to discuss with China and the
                            other governments concerned we expected to talk with them and then come
                            back to the Japanese, and that then only would a stage of negotiations
                            be reached. Mr. Wakasugi did not seem to be disposed to argue any of
                            these points with Mr. Ballantine but simply asked that they be referred
                            to the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called by appointment made at his request at the
                            Secretary’s apartment.<note n="55" xml:id="d393fn55">Mr. Wakasugi
                                accompanied the Ambassador.</note> The Secretary referred to the
                            Japanese proposal in regard to commercial policy which the Ambassador
                            had presented on November 7 and November 10 and offered oral comment
                            along the line of the oral statement which, together with the draft of a
                            joint United States-Japanese declaration on economic policy, he then
                            handed to the Ambassador.<note n="56" xml:id="d393fn56"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> The Secretary emphasized the
                            advantageous and worthwhile character to Japan of participation by Japan
                            in a program such as that envisaged in the draft. The Japanese
                            Ambassador said that he could not comment upon that matter but that he
                            would refer it to his Government. The Japanese Minister asked whether
                            this proposal constituted our answer to the Japanese Government on the
                            question of non-discrimination in international commercial relations
                            which had been outstanding in our conversations. The Secretary replied
                            in the affirmative. The Japanese Minister then said that the Japanese
                            Government desired our reply on the two other outstanding questions,
                            namely, the question of Japan’s relations with the Tripartite Pact and
                            the question of the stationing of Japanese troops in China. The
                            Ambassador then stated that he also wanted to bring up the point that
                            the Japanese Government considered that we were now engaged in actual
                            negotiations and not in merely exploratory conversations as the American
                            Government had contended. The Secretary, after asking the Japanese
                            Minister to make accurate note of what the Secretary was about to say,
                            replied that if we are to work out a peaceful settlement in the Pacific
                            area he could do this only on the basis of carrying on <pb n="732"
                                xml:id="pg_732" facs="0798"/>exploratory conversations until we
                            reached a stage when he could go to Great Britain, to China and to the
                            Dutch and say to them that he believes that the attitudes of Japan and
                            the United States are such as to afford a basis for negotiation and that
                            we could call what took place thereafter a negotiation. He said also
                            that it would be impossible for him to collaborate with those other
                            countries until we had got things on a satisfactory basis; that
                            otherwise they might read in the newspapers that he was negotiating with
                            Japan on matters affecting them without their being consulted. The
                            Ambassador made no comment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to point out that notwithstanding the fact that the
                            conversations between the Secretary and the Ambassador had related to a
                            settlement covering the entire Pacific area and our draft of June 21 had
                            made this clear, the Japanese proposals of September 25 narrowed the
                            application of nondiscrimination and of peace to the southwestern
                            Pacific area. The Ambassador replied that the question of peace in the
                            entire Pacific area was covered in the preamble of their draft, but the
                            Secretary pointed out that what was said in the body of the document
                            rather than in the preamble governed. The Secretary added that he would
                            like to know the attitude of the Japanese Government on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the Japanese Foreign Minister in his
                            conversation with Ambassador Grew on November 10 had indicated that the
                            Japanese Government desired to conclude an agreement with the British
                            simultaneously with concluding an agreement with this country, and yet
                            the Japanese Government expected us to answer at once the Japanese
                            Government’s proposals. He suggested that there was some inconsistency
                            between the instructions which the Japanese Ambassador was being asked
                            to carry out here and what the Foreign Minister had in mind in regard to
                            the British. The Secretary then commented that the Ambassador said that
                            Japan wants an answer now, but that the Secretary felt that the Japanese
                            Government ought to come and tell us whether it intends to adopt
                            peaceful courses. The Ambassador said that there was no doubt about the
                            desire of the Japanese Government to have peace in the Pacific and that
                            Japan had freedom of decision and would make its own interpretation of
                            its obligations under the alliance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether if the Japanese Government should enter into
                            agreement with us the alliance would be automatically abandoned. Mr.
                            Wakasugi inquired whether we were asking that the Tripartite Pact be
                            denounced. The Ambassador said that he understood what the Secretary had
                            said to mean abandoned in the sense of becoming a dead letter. The
                            Secretary rejoined that, just as the Ambassador had suggested, could we
                            assume that if the Japanese <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0799"
                            />Government entered into an agreement with us the Tripartite Pact would
                            automatically become a dead letter, for supposing that he went to the
                            British and the Dutch and said that Japan was willing to enter on a
                            peaceful program but at the same time desired to adhere to a fighting
                            alliance with Germany, what would the British and Dutch say? He asked
                            how he could make the British believe in Japan’s peaceful intentions
                            while Japan was proclaiming its adherence intact to a military alliance
                            with Germany. He pointed out that it would be very difficult for him to
                            make the people of this country and the people of all peaceful nations
                            believe that Japan was pursuing a peaceful course so long as Japan was
                            tied in an alliance with the most flagrant aggressor who has appeared on
                            this planet in the last 2,000 years. The Ambassador commented that the
                            public had so much confidence in the Secretary that they would accept
                            the agreement with us if the Secretary recommended it. The Secretary
                            replied that if we went into an agreement with Japan while Japan had an
                            outstanding obligation to Germany which might call upon Japan to go to
                            war with us this would cause so much turmoil in the country that he
                            might well be lynched. The Secretary pointed out that, notwithstanding
                            the existence of a neutrality pact between Japan and Russia, large
                            Japanese armies in Manchuria were facing Russian armies in Siberia. The
                            Secretary said that what we had in mind was an agreement which would
                            promote mutual trust and enable us to get away from the expansion of
                            military preparations, and what he desired was a clear-cut unequivocal
                            agreement which would remove the doubts that Japan was trying to face
                            two ways in order that we could remove distrust between nations in the
                            Pacific area. The Secretary said that, so long as Japan insisted that it
                            would make its own interpretation of its obligations under the
                            Tripartite Pact in the event that the United States through self-defense
                            was obliged to take up arms against Germany, it would be very difficult
                            for the world to see that Japan’s clear intention was to adopt peaceful
                            courses. The Secretary said he would like to know whether, when an
                            agreement is reached with us, Japan’s connection with the Tripartite
                            Pact would automatically disappear.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Minister asked the Secretary whether what he had said was
                            the answer of this Government on the question of Japan’s relations with
                            the Tripartite Pact. The Secretary replied that when we got an answer
                            from the Japanese Government in regard to its attitude on the point that
                            he had raised about the Tripartite Pact becoming automatically a dead
                            letter in case we entered into an agreement with Japan we would be
                            better able to make reply. The Japanese Ambassador said that he was
                            afraid that the American Government did not trust the Japanese
                            Government whereas there was <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0800"/>no
                            material difference between the policies of the present Japanese
                            Government and the previous Japanese Government, notwithstanding the
                            fact that the Prime Minister was a military man. The Secretary replied
                            that the new Government in Japan seems to take the attitude that we must
                            reply at once to their points, but that we do not feel that we should be
                            receiving ultimatums of such a character from the Japanese Government
                            under circumstances where the United States has been pursuing peaceful
                            courses throughout and the Japanese Government is the one which has been
                            violating law and order. The Secretary said, in conclusion, that when we
                            hear from the Japanese Government concerning its position on the points
                            we had raised with them two days ago on their peaceful intentions and
                            when we could clear up the question of non-discrimination, as suggested
                            in our proposal of today, and also in regard to the Tripartite Pact, he
                            believed that we could sit down like brothers and reach some solution of
                            the question of stationing Japanese troops in China. The Secretary
                            emphasized at the same time that we did not desire any delay and that we
                            were working as hard as we could to bring about a wholly satisfactory
                            and broad settlement.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Government has stated that it “recognizes the principle of
                            non-discrimination in international commercial relations to be applied
                            to all the Pacific areas, inclusive of China, <hi rend="underline">on
                                the understanding that the principle in question is to be applied
                                uniformly to the rest of the entire world as well”</hi>.
                            (Underlining added.)</p>
                        <p>The underlined portion of the statement sets forth a condition the
                            meaning of which is not entirely clear. It is assumed, however, that it
                            is not the intention of the Japanese Government to ask the Government of
                            the United States to assume responsibility for discriminatory practices
                            in areas outside of its sovereign jurisdiction, or to propose including
                            in an arrangement with the United States a condition which could be
                            fulfilled only with the consent and cooperation of all other
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>The principle of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment has for many
                            years been the cornerstone of the commercial policy of the United
                            States. Since the first World War this principle has been embodied in
                            virtually every commercial treaty concluded by this Government. Since
                            1934, when the United States embarked upon an extensive program of
                            commercial agreements for the reduction of <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735"
                                facs="0801"/>trade barriers, it has constantly applied this
                            principle. In twenty-two agreements this Government has on its part
                            reduced duties on over a thousand classifications of the American
                            tariff, and it has extended these reductions to Japan and all other
                            countries of the world with only two exceptions. These exceptions have
                            been countries whose commercial practices represented a flagrant
                            departure from the principle of non-discriminatory treatment. The
                            withholding of trade-agreement concessions from those countries was
                            itself a step in furtherance of the policy of non-discrimination since
                            the purpose was to create inducement for the abandonment of
                            discriminatory practices. One of the countries from which the benefit of
                            such concessions had been withheld abandoned its flagrant discriminatory
                            measures, and the United States at once extended to that country the
                            benefit of the duty reductions made in its trade agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has not only placed its own trade
                            relations with foreign countries on an unconditional most-favored-nation
                            basis, but has sought consistently to further the application of that
                            policy throughout the world. On every appropriate occasion it has urged
                            upon other countries the adoption of non-discriminatory policies and has
                            sought to bring about the progressive elimination of preferences and
                            discriminations of all kinds.</p>
                        <p>In the twenty-two trade agreements above referred to, the Government of
                            the United States has obtained from foreign countries commitments
                            respecting the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers on
                            thousands of products. These concessions affect products which are
                            imported not only from the United States but from other countries as
                            well. The Government of the United States has neither sought nor
                            accepted commitments whereby these benefits would be restricted to
                            imports from the United States. On the contrary, it has obtained these
                            reductions in the trade barriers of foreign countries on the assumption
                            and expectation that they would be extended to other supplying
                            countries. Indeed, as part of its general policy of nondiscrimination in
                            international trade, it has advocated the extension to all countries of
                            the concessions made in such agreements. In this way the reduction of
                            trade barriers which results from a program of trade agreements such as
                            that pursued by the United States is given the widest possible effect
                            and makes the maximum contribution to the building up of world trade
                            from which all nations benefit.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that, if Japan would devote itself to wholehearted
                            cooperation in furthering the policy of non-discrimination as practiced
                            and advocated by the Government of the United States and as practiced
                            and advocated for many years by the Government of Japan, a long forward
                            step would be taken toward attaining the objective which the Japanese
                            Government’s statement under reference has in view.</p>
                        <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0802"/>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, the Government of the United States raises
                            question whether in the view of the Japanese Government there is need of
                            the proviso under discussion, namely, “on the understanding that the
                            principle in question is to be applied uniformly to the rest of the
                            entire world as well”, and whether the proviso might not be omitted.</p>
                        <p>As a practical manifestation of the way in which the Government of the
                            United States has applied and is prepared to apply the principle of
                            non-discrimination in international commercial relations, there is
                            offered for consideration as a purely tentative suggestion a draft of a
                            possible United States-Japanese declaration on economic policy. It is
                            understood, of course, that agreement as to such a declaration is
                            subject to agreement on the other points involved in a peaceful
                            settlement covering the Pacific area as a whole and that this Government
                            would expect, before entering into negotiations on such a possible
                            United States-Japanese declaration on economic policy, to discuss the
                            matter with the British Government and with other specially interested
                            governments.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at the Secretary’s office to present Mr.
                            Kurusu in pursuance of an appointment made at the Ambassador’s
                            request.</p>
                        <p>After the Ambassador had presented Mr. Kurusu and appropriate amenities
                            had been exchanged, the Secretary complimented Mr. Kurusu upon the way
                            he had handled his relations with the public since coming to this
                            country. The Secretary then spoke highly of the respect and confidence
                            in which the Secretary and his associates hold the Japanese
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then went on to say that, from the point of view of the
                            long-swing interests of both Japan and the United States, he felt that
                            there should be no conflict in the real interests of the two countries.
                            He referred then to the short-sighted nationalistic statesmanship that
                            developed in Europe and in the United States after the World War which
                            he said was responsible for the troubles from which the world is now
                            suffering. He expressed the hope that our two countries could pursue a
                            wise, far-sighted statesmanship and in this way do something to
                            contribute to put the world back on peaceful courses. He pointed to the
                            fact that Hitler was holding down one or two hundred million people in
                            Europe at the point of the bayonet and observed that this was a
                            situation we do not like to see perpetuated in this world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that there appeared to be an unfortunate impression that
                            in certain quarters in this country the new Prime Minister, being a
                            military man, had an outlook and attitude which was different from that
                            of the previous Prime Minister, but that Kurusu himself had been
                            agreeably surprised when he discussed policies with General Tojo and
                            found him to be sincerely desirous of reaching an agreement with the
                            United States. He said he wished to tell the Secretary off the record
                            that when General Tojo had been commanded to form a cabinet, Tojo had
                            invited Kurusu to take an important position in the cabinet but that
                            Kurusu had declined because he had thought, having read the announcement
                            that the Konoye cabinet had fallen on account of important differences
                            within the cabinet as to methods of executing national policy, that
                            General Tojo intended to discontinue the conversations with the United
                            States. Kurusu said that later on he had discussed with General Tojo the
                            matter of his present mission and he was fully reassured of the
                            General’s desire to reach a peaceful settlement with the United States.
                            Kurusu said that in the three important points on which differences have
                            developed in our conversations <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0805"
                            />General Tojo seemed to be optimistic in regard to the prospects of
                            eliminating the differences in respect to nondiscrimination and the
                            relations of the two countries toward the European war, but that the
                            General felt that on account of the difficulty of withdrawing Japanese
                            troops from China in a short time this problem would be one which would
                            present greater difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was interrupted at this point owing to the approach of
                            the hour for the President’s reception of the Ambassador and Mr.
                            Kurusu.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador handed the Secretary two documents which the Ambassador
                            said were the Japanese Government’s reply to the points we had raised on
                            (1) Japan’s peaceful intentions<note n="57" xml:id="d395fn57"><hi

                        <p>Reference is made to the oral statement handed by the Secretary of State
                            to the Japanese Ambassador on November 12, 1941 and, under instructions

                                    statement are embodied in the proposals which the Japanese
                                    Government made to the United States Government on the 6th and
                                    25th of September last and the present Japanese Cabinet also has
                                    no objection whatever to confirming these points as expressing
                                    its general purport. It is, however, to be taken for granted
                                    that such confirmation has the successful conclusion of the

                                    chance such successful conclusion, the Japanese Government is
                                    naturally not to be left bound by its commitment on the points

                                    stipulation was made out of considerations of the existing
                                    Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty and its relation to the war

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador has been authorized to state that the Japanese
                            Government has no objection whatever to apply the principle of political
                            stabilization to the entire area of the Pacific and that the Japanese
                            Government is willing to eliminate the word “southwestern” from the text
                            of Article VI of its proposal of September 25th.</p>

                        <p>I accompanied Ambassador Nomura and Ambassador Saburo Kurusu to the White
                            House in order that the latter might be received by the President.</p>
                        <p>Following several minutes of an exchange of courtesies and formalities,
                            the President brought up the more serious side by referring to the
                            misunderstandings and matters of difference between our countries and
                            made clear the desire of this country, and he accepted the statement of
                            the Japanese Ambassador that it was the desire of Japan equally, to
                            avoid war between our two countries and to bring about a settlement on a
                            fair and peaceful basis so far as the Pacific area was concerned.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu proceeded with one line of remarks that he kept up
                            during the conversation and that was that we must find ways to work out
                            an agreement to avoid trouble between our two countries. He said that
                            all the way across the Pacific it was like a powder keg, and again he
                            repeated that some way must be found to adjust the situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu made some specious attempt to explain away the
                            Tripartite Pact. I replied in language similar to that which I used in
                            discussing this matter with Ambassador Nomura on November fifteenth,
                            which need not be repeated here. I made it clear that any kind of a
                            peaceful settlement for the Pacific area, with Japan still clinging to
                            her Tripartite Pact with Germany, would cause the President <pb n="741"
                                xml:id="pg_741" facs="0807"/>and myself to be denounced in
                            immeasurable terms and the peace arrangement would not for a moment be
                            taken seriously while all of the countries interested in the Pacific
                            would redouble their efforts to arm against Japanese aggression. I
                            emphasized the point about the Tripartite Pact and self-defense by
                            saying that when Hitler starts on a march of invasion across the earth
                            with ten million soldiers and thirty thousand airplanes with an official
                            announcement that he is out for unlimited invasion objectives, this
                            country from that time was in danger and that danger has grown each week
                            until this minute. The result was that this country with no other motive
                            except self-defense has recognized that danger, and has proceeded thus
                            far to defend itself before it is too late; and that the Government of
                            Japan says that it does not know whether this country is thus acting in
                            self-defense or not. This country feels so profoundly the danger that it
                            has committed itself to ten, twenty-five or fifty billions of dollars in
                            self-defense; but when Japan is asked about whether this is
                            self-defense, she indicates that she has no opinion on the subject—I
                            said that I cannot get this view over to the American people; that they
                            believe Japan must know that we are acting in self-defense and,
                            therefore, they do not understand her present attitude. I said that he
                            was speaking of their political difficulties and that I was thus
                            illustrating some of our difficulties in connection with this country’s
                            relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that some time ago he proclaimed a zone around
                            this hemisphere, 300 miles out in the sea in some places and 1,100 miles
                            in others. The President added that this was self-defense.</p>
                        <p>I then said that Ambassador Nomura and I have been proceeding on the view
                            that the people of the United States and Japan alike are a proud and
                            great people and there is no occasion for either to attempt to bluff the
                            other and we would not consider that bluffing enters into our
                            conversations, which are of genuine friendliness.</p>
                        <p>The President brought out a number of illustrations of our situation and
                            the Japanese situation as it relates to Germany and our self-defense
                            which serve to emphasize our position and to expose the sophistry of the
                            Japanese position.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu said that Germany had not up to this time requested
                            Japan to fight; that she was serving a desirable purpose without doing
                            so,—this must have meant that she was keeping the American and British
                            Navies, aircraft, et cetera, diverted.</p>
                        <p>The further question of whether the United States is on the defensive in
                            the present Pacific situation came up by some general discussion in
                            reference to that situation by Ambassador Kurusu, and the President and
                            I made it clear that we were not the aggressors in the Pacific but that
                            Japan was the aggressor.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0808"/>
                        <p>At another point I said that the belief in this country is that the
                            Japanese formula of a new order in greater East Asia is but another name
                            for a program to dominate entirely, politically, economically, socially
                            and otherwise by military force all of the Pacific area; that this would
                            include the high seas, the islands and the continents and would place
                            every other country at the mercy of very arbitrary military rule just as
                            the Hitler program does in Europe and the Japanese in China. The
                            Ambassador made no particular comment.</p>
                        <p>There was some effort by Ambassador Kurusu to defend their plan of not
                            bringing the troops out of China. Placing the Japanese on the defensive,
                            the President said that the question ought to be worked out in a fair
                            way considering all of the circumstances and relative merits of the
                            matters involved; and that at a suitable stage, while we know that Japan
                            does not wish us to mediate in any way, this Government might, so to
                            speak, introduce Japan and China to each other and tell them to proceed
                            with the remaining or detailed adjustments, the Pacific questions having
                            already been determined.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu strongly stated that it would be most difficult to
                            bring all the troops out of China at once.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu said that we, of course, desired to bring up both sides
                            of matters existing between our two countries and he said that we would
                            recall that when the Japanese went into Shantung during the World War,
                            this Government insisted that she get out. I replied that my own country
                            opposed a policy of this seizure of new territory by any country to the
                            fullest extent of its ability to do so; that it declined to take a
                            dollar of compensation or a foot of territory for itself; that it
                            insisted that the world must turn over a new leaf in this respect or
                            nations would be fighting always for territory and under modern methods
                            of war would soon destroy and utterly impoverish each other; that in any
                            event his country fared well in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The question of our recent proposal on commercial policy was brought up
                            by us and Ambassador Kurusu said he had not examined it and that he had
                            forgotten much of the technical side of commercial policy since he was
                            in the Foreign Office. The President made very pertinent and timely
                            reference to the destructive nature of armaments and the still more
                            destructive effects of a permanent policy of armaments which always
                            means war, devastation and destruction. He emphasized the point that
                            there is from the long-term point of view no difference of interest
                            between our two countries and no occasion, therefore, for serious
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>All in all, there was nothing new brought out by the Japanese Ambassador
                            and Ambassador Kurusu. Ambassador Kurusu constantly made the plea that
                            there was no reason why there should <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743"
                                facs="0809"/>be serious differences between the two countries and
                            that ways must be found to solve the present situation. He referred to
                            Prime Minister Tojo as being very desirous of bringing about a peaceful
                            adjustment notwithstanding he is an Army man. The President expressed
                            his interest and satisfaction to hear this. The President frequently
                            parried the remarks of Ambassador Nomura and also of Ambassador Kurusu,
                            especially in regard to the three main points of difference between our
                            two countries. There was no effort to solve these questions at the
                            conference. The meeting broke up with the understanding that I would
                            meet the Japanese representatives tomorrow morning.</p>

                        <p>1814. The Ambassador, referring to his previous telegram No. 1736 of
                            November 3, 3 p.m., final sentence, emphasizes the need to guard against
                            sudden Japanese naval or military actions in such areas as are not now
                            involved in the Chinese theater of operations. He is taking into
                            account, therefore, the probability of the Japanese exploiting every
                            possible tactical advantage, such as surprise and initiative. He advises
                            his Government accordingly of the importance of not placing the major
                            responsibility in giving prior warning upon the Embassy staff, the naval
                            and military attaches included, since in Japan there is extremely
                            effective control over both primary and secondary military information.
                            The Embassy would not expect to obtain any information in advance either
                            from personal Japanese contacts or through the press; the observation of
                            military movements is not possible by the few Americans remaining in the
                            country, concentrated mostly in three cities (Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe);
                            and with American and other foreign shipping absent from adjacent waters
                            the Japanese are assured of the ability to send without foreign
                            observation their troop transports in various directions. Japanese troop
                            concentrations were reported recently by American consuls in Manchuria
                            and Formosa, while troop dispositions since last July’s general
                            mobilization have, according to all other indications available, been
                            made with a view to enabling the carrying out of new operations on the
                            shortest possible notice either in the Pacific southwest or in Siberia
                            or in both.</p>
                        <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0810"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador expresses the Embassy’s full realization that the present
                            most important duty perhaps is to detect any premonitory signs of naval
                            or military operations likely in areas mentioned above and states that
                            every precaution is being taken to guard against surprise. He adds that
                            the Embassy’s field of naval or military observation is restricted
                            almost literally to what could be seen with the naked eye, and this is
                            negligible. Therefore, the United States Government is advised, from an
                            abundance of caution, to discount as much as possible the likelihood of
                            the Embassy’s ability to give substantial warning.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called on the Secretary, by
                            appointment made at their request, at the Department.</p>
                        <p>After some preliminary remarks the Secretary took up the question of
                            Japan’s relations with the Axis. He pointed out that the public would
                            place their own interpretation upon the implications of a situation
                            wherein on the one hand Japan had an agreement with us and on the other
                            was in an alliance with the Axis powers. He said that our people do not
                            trust Hitler and furthermore we feel that it would be inevitable that
                            Hitler would eventually, if he was successful, get around to the Far
                            East and double-cross Japan. The Secretary cited the instance when
                            Germany, after having concluded an anti-Comintern pact with Japan had
                            surprised Japan later on by entering into a non-aggression pact with
                            Russia and finally went back on the non-aggression pact by attacking
                            Russia. The Secretary said that he presumed Japan did not know in
                            advance what Germany’s intentions were any more than we did. The
                            Secretary expressed great doubt that any agreement into which we entered
                            with Japan while Japan at the same time had an alliance with Hitler
                            would carry the confidence of our people and he emphasized that we would
                            have to have a clear-cut agreement making self-evident our peaceful
                            purpose, for otherwise there would be a redoubled effort by all nations
                            to strengthen their armaments. He pointed out that we are coming out of
                            the Philippines in 1946 and that we are now bringing our marines out of
                            China and in this way we are trying to make a contribution to the
                            establishment of a peaceful world based on law and order. He said that
                            this is what we want to work out with Japan; that we had nothing to
                            offer in the way of bargaining except our friendship. Our commercial
                            program <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0811"/>was one, he said,
                            calling for a maximum production and distribution of goods. The
                            Secretary pointed out also that we are even now engaged in efforts to
                            induce the British Empire to reduce its Empire preferences. He said that
                            what we desire is to put our people back to work in a way that can never
                            be accomplished through permitting armies to overrun countries. The
                            Secretary observed that many Japanese spokesmen had spoken of Japan’s
                            desire to have a controlling influence in Eastern Asia, but the only
                            kind of controlling influence which was worth anything was one that
                            could not be achieved or maintained by the sword. He dwelt briefly upon
                            what we have accomplished in South America through our peaceful policies
                            and through renouncing the employment of gunboats and armed forces. The
                            Secretary made it clear that we recognized that under present emergency
                            conditions we cannot carry out to perfection our commercial policy which
                            must be modified to meet war conditions, but we can at least establish
                            the principles. The Secretary said, going back to the situation with
                            regard to Japan’s relations with the Axis, that a difficult situation
                            was created thereby as far as our public was concerned—as, for example,
                            when telegrams of congratulations were sent to Hitler by Japanese
                            leaders when he commits some atrocity.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador observed that the United States and Russia were
                            not pursuing parallel courses and yet we are aligned with Russia at the
                            present time. He also said he appreciated very well the relations we had
                            developed with South America but that, although Japan would like to
                            imitate us, Japan was not in a position to be so magnanimous—as, for
                            example, in the matter of extending substantial lend-lease aid to other
                            countries.… The Secretary then added that he frankly did not know
                            whether anything could be done in the matter of reaching a satisfactory
                            agreement with Japan; that we can go so far but rather than go beyond a
                            certain point it would be better for us to stand and take the
                            consequences. The Ambassador then said that Japan is now hard-pressed
                            and that the Secretary was well aware of how desirous Japan was to reach
                            some agreement with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that he had served five years as Director of the
                            Commercial Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Office and that he was
                            familiar with the developments in Japan’s commercial policy. He said
                            that the situation with respect to the Empire preferences was one of the
                            factors which had influenced Japan to go into the Axis camp. He said
                            that the United States was an economically powerful country and that the
                            United States was, therefore, in a much better position than was Japan
                            to enter into commercial bargaining. Furthermore, Japan was much more
                            dependent than was the United States upon foreign <pb n="746"
                                xml:id="pg_746" facs="0812"/>trade. He felt that what the two
                            Governments should now do would be to achieve something to tide over the
                            present abnormal situation. He referred, for example, to the exchange
                            control situation which had been developed in Japanese-occupied China
                            and expressed the view that that situation could not be done away with
                            in a short time. He said that perhaps after the war was over it might be
                            possible to adopt a more liberal policy but that he was unable to
                            promise anything on the part of his Government. The Secretary asked
                            whether Japan could not now agree in principle on commercial policy. Mr.
                            Kurusu made no direct reply but went on to say that in the early years
                            of American intercourse in the Far East our main interest was in
                            commerce and not religious and cultural activities; that we had pursued
                            a course of idealism, but with American occupation of the Philippines
                            the situation changed somewhat and the United States tied itself in with
                            the European concert of nations.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the Tripartite Pact, Mr. Kurusu said that he
                            could not say that Japan would abrogate the Tripartite Pact but that
                            Japan might do something which would “outshine” the Tripartite Pact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that unless peacefully minded nations now start
                            their program of reconstruction it will be impossible to get such a
                            program started later on because the selfish elements would get control
                            of the situation and prevent the materialization of a liberal policy.
                            Therefore, he said it was necessary to get the fundamental principles
                            established so that we might begin to enable the peaceful forces, which
                            were now demoralized, to assert a leadership. Unless we pursue such a
                            course, the Secretary noted, we shall not be able to obtain the
                            confidence of peacefully minded people when the time for putting into
                            effect a reconstruction program arrives. Mr. Kurusu asked whether the
                            Secretary had a concrete formula for dealing with Japan’s relations with
                            the Axis alliance. The Secretary made it clear that this was a matter
                            for Japan to work out. He said that if we could get a peaceful program
                            firmly established, Hitler ought to be asked not to embarrass us too
                            much. He asked whether Japan could not work it out in some way which
                            would be convincing to the American people. He said that if it goes the
                            wrong way every peaceful nation will redouble its defensive efforts. The
                            Secretary emphasized again that the public would be confused in regard
                            to a survival of a relationship between Japan and the Axis while Japan
                            had an agreement with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether it was not important now to make some
                            understanding to save the situation. The Secretary said he agreed but
                            that he felt that the Tripartite Pact was inconsistent with the
                            establishment of an understanding.</p>
                        <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0813"/>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked what could the Secretary suggest. The Secretary said
                            that if we mix the Tripartite Pact with an agreement with the United
                            States it will not be possible to get many people to follow us. The
                            Secretary said that the question arises whether Japanese statesmen
                            desire to follow entirely peaceful courses with China or whether they
                            desire to face two ways. The Secretary went on to say that if the
                            Japanese should back away from adopting a clear-cut position with regard
                            to commercial policy, with regard to a course in China consistent with
                            peaceful principles and with regard to Japanese relations to the
                            European war this would leave us in an indefensible position in regard
                            to the proposed agreement. We would have to say that the Japanese
                            Government is unable to get its politicians into line.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador repeated that the situation in Japan was very pressing and
                            that it was important to arrest a further deterioration of the relations
                            between the two countries. He suggested that if this situation could now
                            be checked an atmosphere would develop when it would be possible to move
                            in the direction of the courses which this Government advocated. He
                            pointed out that big ships cannot turn around too quickly, that they
                            have to be eased around slowly and gradually.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that if we should sit down and write an agreement
                            permeated with the doctrine of force it would be found that each country
                            would be entirely distrustful and would be piling up armaments, as
                            countries cannot promote peace so long as they are tied in in any way
                            with Hitler.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu pointed out that a comprehensive solution cannot be worked out
                            immediately, that he could make no promises. He said that our freezing
                            regulations had caused impatience in Japan and a feeling that Japan had
                            to fight while it still could. If we could come to some settlement now,
                            he said, it would promote an atmosphere which would be conducive to
                            discussing fundamentals. The Secretary asked if he did not think that
                            something could be worked out on the Tripartite Pact. The Ambassador
                            said that he desired to emphasize that Japan would not be a cat’s-paw
                            for Germany, that Japan’s purpose in entering into the Tripartite
                            alliance was to use it for Japan’s own purposes, that Japan entered the
                            Tripartite Pact because Japan felt isolated. The Secretary observed that
                            it would be difficult to get public opinion in this country to
                            understand the situation as Mr. Kurusu had described it.</p>
                        <p>He then asked what the Ambassador had in mind in regard to the Chinese
                            situation and whether the Japanese stood for no annexations, no
                            indemnities, respect for China’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and
                            the principle of equality. The Ambassador replied in the
                            affirmative.</p>
                        <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0814"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that while he had made this point already clear
                            to the Ambassador he wished to make it clear also to Mr. Kurusu, that
                            whereas the Japanese Government desired to consider our talks
                            negotiations rather than exploratory conversations, the Secretary felt
                            that without having first reached a real basis for negotiations, he was
                            not in a position to go to the British or the Chinese or the other
                            governments involved, as these governments had a rightful interest in
                            these problems. Mr. Kurusu tried to get the Secretary to specify in just
                            which problems each of the respective governments were interested but
                            the Secretary said that he had not yet, for manifest reasons, discussed
                            these problems with these other governments and anything that he might
                            say would be just an assumption on his part. Mr. Kurusu then said that
                            under such circumstances United States-Japanese relations would be at
                            the mercy of Great Britain and China. The Secretary replied that he
                            believed and must repeat that we must have something substantial in the
                            way of a basis for an agreement to take to these governments for
                            otherwise there would be no point in talking to them. Mr. Kurusu said
                            that the situation was so pressing that it might get beyond our control.
                            The Secretary agreed that that was true but he pointed out that the fact
                            that Japan’s leaders keep announcing programs based upon force adds to
                            our difficulties. He said he would like to leave the Hitler situation to
                            the Japanese Government for consideration.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the China situation the Secretary asked how many soldiers the
                            Japanese wanted to retain in China. The Ambassador replied that possibly
                            90 per cent would be withdrawn. The Secretary asked how long the
                            Japanese intended to keep that remaining 10 per cent in China. The
                            Ambassador did not reply directly to this but he invited attention to
                            the fact that under the existing Boxer Protocol Japan was permitted to
                            retain troops in the Peiping and Tientsin area. The Secretary pointed
                            out that the question of the Japanese troops in China was one in which
                            there were many elements of trouble. American interests even had
                            suffered severely from the actions of the Japanese forces and we had a
                            long list of such instances. The Secretary made mention of the great
                            patience this Government had exercised in the presence of this
                            situation. He said the situation was one in which the extremists seemed
                            to be looking for trouble and he said that it was up to the Japanese
                            Government to make an extra effort to take the situation by the collar.
                            He said also that the United States and Japan had trusted each other in
                            the past, that the present situation was one of Japan’s own making and
                            it was up to the Japanese Government to find some way of getting itself
                            out of the difficulty in which it had placed itself. The Secretary went
                            on to say that the situation was now exceptionally advantageous for
                            Japan to put her factories to work in producing goods which <pb n="749"
                                xml:id="pg_749" facs="0815"/>are needed by peaceful countries if
                            only the Japanese people could get war and invasion out of mind. The
                            Ambassador said that our conversations had been protracted and if the
                            American Government could only give the Japanese some hope with regard
                            to the situation it might be helpful. He added that our country was
                            great and strong. The Secretary replied that our Government has not made
                            any threats and he has exercised his influence throughout to deprecate
                            bellicose utterances in this country. He added that the Japanese armed
                            forces in China do not appear to realize whose territory they are in and
                            that the people in this country say that Hitler proposes to take charge
                            of one-half of the world and Japan proposes to take charge of the other
                            half and if they should succeed what would there be left for the United
                            States? Mr. Kurusu suggested that Japan would have to move gradually in
                            China, that one step might lead to another and that what was important
                            now was to do something to enable Japan to change its course. The
                            Secretary asked what was in Mr. Kurusu’s mind. In reply to a suggestion
                            that it was felt in Japanese circles that we have been responsible for
                            delay the Secretary pointed out that we could more rightly accuse the
                            Japanese of delays, that he had met with the Japanese Ambassador
                            promptly every time the latter had asked for a meeting and had discussed
                            matters fully with him. The Secretary added that when Japan’s movement
                            into Indochina in July took place this had caused an interruption of our
                            conversations and it was then that the Secretary could no longer defend
                            the continued shipments of petroleum products to Japan, especially as
                            for the past year he had been under severe criticism in this country for
                            not having cut off those shipments. Mr. Kurusu asked whether we wanted
                            the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> to be restored or what we
                            expected Japan to do. The Secretary replied that if the Japanese could
                            not do anything now on those three points—getting troops out of China,
                            commercial policy and the Tripartite agreement—he could only leave to
                            Japan what Japan could do. The Secretary said that it is our desire to
                            see Japan help furnish a world leadership for a peaceful program and
                            that he felt that Japan’s long-swing interests were the same as our
                            interests. The Ambassador said that he realized that our Government was
                            suspicious of the Japanese Government but he wished to assure us that
                            Japan wanted to settle the China affair notwithstanding the fact that
                            Japan desired to keep a few troops in China for the time being. The
                            Secretary then asked again what the Japanese had in mind. Mr. Kurusu
                            said that it was Japan’s intention to withdraw Japanese troops from
                            French Indochina as soon as a just Pacific settlement should be reached
                            and he pointed out that the Japanese Government took the Burma Road
                            situation very seriously. The Secretary asked, if there should be a
                            relaxation of freezing, to what extent would that enable Japan to adopt
                            peaceful <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0816"/>policies. He explained
                            that what he had in mind was to enable the peaceful leaders in Japan to
                            get control of the situation in Japan and to assert their influence. The
                            Ambassador said that our position was unyielding and that it was Japan’s
                            unyielding attitude toward Chiang Kai-shek which had stiffened Chinese
                            resistance against Japan. He asked whether there was any hope of a
                            solution—some small beginning toward the realization of our high ideals.
                            The Secretary replied that if we do not work out an agreement that the
                            public trusts the arming of nations will go on; that the Japanese
                            Government has a responsibility in the matter as it has created the
                            conditions we are trying to deal with. The Ambassador then suggested the
                            possibility of going back to the status which existed before the date in
                            July when, following the Japanese move into southern French Indochina,
                            our freezing measures were put into effect. The Secretary said that if
                            we should make some modifications in our embargo on the strength of a
                            step by Japan such as the Ambassador had mentioned we do not know
                            whether the troops which have been withdrawn from French Indochina will
                            be diverted to some equally objectionable movement elsewhere. The
                            Ambassador said that what he had in mind was simply some move toward
                            arresting the dangerous trend in our relations. The Secretary said that
                            it would be difficult for him to get this Government to go a long way in
                            removing the embargo unless this Government believed that Japan was
                            definitely started on a peaceful course and had renounced purposes of
                            conquest. The Ambassador said that the Japanese were tired of fighting
                            China and that Japan would go as far as it could along a first step. The
                            Secretary said that he would consult with the British and the Dutch to
                            see what their attitude would be toward the suggestion offered by the
                            Japanese Ambassador. In reply to a question by the Secretary the
                            Ambassador replied that the Japanese Government was still studying the
                            questions of commercial policy involved in our proposal of November 15.
                            He said he assumed that what we had in mind was a program for dealing
                            with the situation after the war. The Secretary replied in the
                            affirmative, so far as the full operation of a sound program is
                            concerned, but added that it should now be agreed upon as to
                            principles.</p>
                        <p>When asked by the Secretary as to when the Ambassador would like to
                            confer with us again the Ambassador said that he would get in touch with
                            his Government and would communicate to the Secretary through Mr.
                            Ballantine.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called at their request at the
                            Secretary’s apartment. After about fifteen minutes of general
                            conversation the Ambassador said that he and Mr. Kurusu had reported to
                            their Government their conversation of yesterday with the Secretary and
                            were momentarily expecting instructions, and that in fact a telegram had
                            already come in but it had not yet been decoded. They said that they
                            would wish to confer with the Secretary perhaps tomorrow, but would at
                            least expect to communicate with him tomorrow in regard to a further
                            appointment. They expressed satisfaction with what the Secretary had
                            said to the press in regard to yesterday’s conversation and the
                            Secretary remarked that the press seemed to be satisfied.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked how the Ambassador felt about the possibilities.
                            The Ambassador said that yesterday he had made the suggestion in regard
                            to a restoration of the status which prevailed before the Japanese move
                            into south Indochina in the latter part of July because he felt that, as
                            this action had precipitated our freezing measures which in turn had
                            reacted in Japan to increase the tension, if something could be done on
                            his suggestion, it would serve to relieve that tension and tend to
                            create a better atmosphere in our relations. The Secretary asked whether
                            the Ambassador contemplated that if a proposal such as the Ambassador
                            had suggested were carried out we would go on with the conversations.
                            The Ambassador replied in the affirmative. The Secretary expressed the
                            view that this might enable the leaders in Japan to hold their ground
                            and organize public opinion in favor of a peaceful course. He said that
                            he recognized that this might take some time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that what was in his mind was that both sides now
                            appeared to be preparing for eventualities and that nevertheless the
                            Japanese desired a quick settlement, especially in view of our freezing
                            measures. The Secretary said that he presumed that the Ambassador had in
                            mind, in connection with the continuation of our conversations, further
                            efforts to iron out the important points on which our views had not so
                            far diverged. The Ambassador agreed. He observed, however, that the
                            views of the Japanese Government with regard to the Tripartite Pact had
                            been fully expressed by the Japanese Government; that is to say, that
                            their intentions to maintain peace in the Pacific were already made
                            clear in their draft statement of September 25, but that they could not
                            abrogate the Tripartite Alliance and were bound to carry out their
                            obligations. The Secretary suggested that one way in which the Japanese
                            could be <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0818"/>helpful would be to
                            let the Russian forces in the Far East and the British forces at
                            Singapore go back to Europe. The Secretary said that his suggestion was
                            by way of illustration how much Japan was hindering us. The Secretary
                            added that if Hitler were helping the world the situation would be
                            different, but the fact was that he was injuring all of us.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned for a few minutes to the situation in Russia
                            and Germany’s prospects. The Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu expressed the
                            view that there seemed to be no likelihood of an early Russian defeat or
                            of a collapse of Stalin’s regime. The Ambassador said that he had been
                            much surprised at the strength Stalin had shown in holding his
                            government together and he also spoke with admiration of the
                            stubbornness of Russian defense. The Ambassador also expressed the view
                            that he saw no prospect of Germany’s being able in the future to launch
                            a successful invasion of England. The Secretary asked, if Germany could
                            not conquer Stalin, could not invade England, and was faced with the
                            hostility of the many millions in Europe which were being held in
                            subjection by Germany, what would be the outcome for Germany. The
                            Ambassador expressed no clear-cut views on this point. The Secretary
                            suggested that if the Japanese Government could prevail over the views
                            of the Japanese war party it should be possible to work out something
                            with us. The Ambassador made a further reference to Japan’s being bound
                            by the Tripartite Pact, whereupon the Secretary asked whether Japan was
                            not equally bound by the neutrality pact with Russia. The Ambassador
                            replied that if Japan was faithful to the Tripartite Pact it must be
                            equally faithful to the neutrality pact as they were both equally
                            binding. The Ambassador dwelt at some length upon the point that Japan
                            was getting nothing out of the Tripartite Pact except American
                            resentment. Mr. Kurusu then expressed the view that although he did not
                            see any prospect of another Brest-Litovsk<note n="59" xml:id="d401fn59"

                            Japan would be very apprehensive of such a development as it would mean
                            a combined Russo-German advance on the Far East.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the need of looking forward to the time for
                            rebuilding the world and said that, if the Japanese militant leaders
                            keep control of Japanese policy, they would deprive us of a chance of
                            stabilizing the world and laying down a progressive program. The
                            Ambassador said that the United States was likely at the end of the war
                            to be in a position of overwhelming strength, but he intimated that we
                            might impair our strength if we sent forces to Africa. There then ensued
                            some discussion of Hitler’s efforts to gain control of the seas and the
                            Secretary emphasized that this country is determined to keep Hitler from
                            getting control of the seas no matter how long it took us. <pb n="753"
                                xml:id="pg_753" facs="0819"/>He expressed the view that if Hitler
                            had striven only for limited objectives he might have had a better
                            chance for success than he now has because of his unlimited program of
                            conquest. The Secretary said that if the Japanese could tell Hitler to
                            be reasonable—Mr. Kurusu interrupted at this point and said that he
                            thought that Hitler would be willing to enter into peace negotiations.
                            The Secretary replied that he was speaking figuratively; that what he
                            meant was abandonment entirely by Hitler of his program of conquest. The
                            Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu then rose to take leave and as they did so the
                            Secretary emphasized again that all we can do is to stand firm on our
                            basic principles.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called at their request at the
                            Department. Mr. Kurusu said that they had referred to their Government
                            the suggestion which the Ambassador had made at a previous meeting in
                            regard to a return to the status which prevailed prior to the Japanese
                            move into south Indochina last July, and said that they had anticipated
                            that the Japanese Government might perceive difficulty in moving troops
                            out of Indochina in short order, but that nevertheless the Japanese
                            Government was now prepared to offer a proposal on that basis. He said,
                            however, that the proposal represented an amplification of the
                            Ambassador’s suggestion. He then read the proposal to the Secretary
                            which was as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the proposal printed <hi rend="italic"
                            >infra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would later examine the proposal, and that he
                            would give sympathetic study to the proposal speaking generally, but
                            that the comments which he was about to make were not directed
                            specifically to the proposal but to the general situation. The Secretary
                            said that Japan had it in its power at any moment to put an end to the
                            present situation by deciding upon an all-out peaceful course; that at
                            any moment Japan could bring to an end what Japan chose to call
                            encirclement. He said that we want to have Japan develop public opinion
                            in favor of a peaceful course. Mr. Kurusu said that if we could
                            alleviate the situation by adopting a proposal such as the Japanese
                            Government had just made it would help develop public opinion. The
                            Ambassador said that the Japanese Government was clearly desirous of
                            peace and that it was trying to show this peaceful purpose by relieving
                            the pressure on Thailand which adoption of the proposal would
                            accomplish.</p>
                        <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0820"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the Ambassador thought would be the public
                            reaction in this country if we were to announce tomorrow that we had
                            decided to discontinue aid to Great Britain. He said that in the minds
                            of the American people the purposes underlying our aid to China were the
                            same as the purposes underlying aid to Great Britain; that the American
                            people believed that there was a partnership between Hitler and Japan
                            aimed at enabling Hitler to take charge of one-half of the world and
                            Japan of the other half; and that the fact of the Tripartite Alliance
                            and the continual harping by Japanese leaders upon slogans of the Nazi
                            type such as “new order in East Asia” and “co-prosperity sphere” served
                            to strengthen the public in their belief. What was therefore needed, the
                            Secretary pointed out, was the manifestation by Japan of a clear purpose
                            to pursue peaceful courses.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that there was no doubt of Japan’s desire for
                            peace, as this was clear from the eagerness of the Japanese Government
                            to reach a settlement of the China affair—and indeed adoption of the
                            Japanese Government’s proposal that he had just presented was designed
                            to bring about speedy settlement of the China affair. He said that the
                            Japanese people after four years of fighting were jaded and that the
                            slogans to which the Secretary had made reference were intended to
                            encourage the Japanese people to push on to victory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we of course are anxious to help work this matter
                            out for if we should get into trouble everybody was likely to get
                            hurt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that if we could go ahead with the present proposal the
                            Japanese idea would be that we could go on working at fundamentals. He
                            said that Japan has never pledged itself to a policy of expansion. The
                            Secretary observed that the Chinese might have an answer to that point.
                            The Secretary said that our people desired to avoid a repetition in east
                            Asia of what Hitler was doing in Europe; that our people oppose the idea
                            of a “new order” under military control. He said also that the public in
                            this country thinks that Japan is chained to Hitler. Mr. Kurusu asked
                            how Japan could eradicate such a belief as Japan could not abrogate the
                            Tripartite Pact. The Secretary said that he did not want to be
                            disagreeable, but he felt he must observe that Japan did not talk that
                            way about the Nine Power Treaty.<note n="60" xml:id="d402fn60"><ref

                                    276</ref>.</note> Mr. Kurusu said something about the Nine Power
                            Treaty being twenty years old and being outmoded. The Secretary said
                            that of course he did not wish to argue the matter. He said that when
                            the Japanese complained about our helping China the public in this
                            country wonders what is underneath the Comintern Pact. He emphasized
                            that Japan is doing this country tremendous injury in the Pacific; <pb
                                n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0821"/>that Japanese statesmen ought
                            to understand that we are helping China for the same reason that we are
                            helping Britain; that we are afraid of the military elements led by
                            Hitler. He added that the methods adopted by the Japanese military
                            leaders in China were not unlike Hitler’s methods. The Ambassador asked
                            how we could save the situation at this juncture. The Secretary replied
                            that he agreed upon the urgent importance of saving it, but he asked
                            whether the Ambassador thought that the Japanese statesmen could tone
                            down the situation in Japan. Mr. Kurusu said, with reference to the
                            fifth point in the Japanese proposal, that he did not know whether his
                            Government would agree but he thought that that point might be
                            interpreted to mean that American aid to China would be discontinued as
                            from the time that negotiations were started. The Secretary made no
                            comment on that point but noted that in the last few days there had been
                            marked subsidence in warlike utterances emanating from Tokyo, and he
                            felt that it was indeed a great tribute to the Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu
                            that so much had been accomplished in this direction within a short
                            space of two days as he felt sure that it was their efforts which had
                            brought this about. He said that if so much had been accomplished within
                            the course of two days, much more could be accomplished in the course of
                            a longer period.</p>
                        <p>No time was set for the next meeting.</p>

                        <p>1. Both the Governments of Japan and the United States undertake hot to
                            make any armed advancement into any of the regions in the South-eastern
                            Asia and the Southern Pacific area excepting the part of French
                            Indo-China where the Japanese troops are stationed at present.</p>
                        <p>2. The Japanese Government undertakes to withdraw its troops now
                            stationed in French Indo-China upon either the restoration of peace
                            between Japan and China or the establishment of an equitable peace in
                            the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime the Government of Japan declares that it is prepared to
                            remove its troops now stationed in the southern part of French
                            Indo-China to the northern part of the said territory upon the
                            conclusion of the present arrangement which shall later be embodied in
                            the final agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0822"/>
                        <p>3. The Government of Japan and the United States shall cooperate with a
                            view to securing the acquisition of those goods and commodities which
                            the two countries need in Netherlands East Indies.</p>
                        <p>4. The Governments of Japan and the United States mutually undertake to
                            restore their commercial relations to those prevailing prior to the
                            freezing of the assets.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States shall supply Japan a required
                            quantity of oil.</p>
                        <p>5. The Government of the United States undertakes to refrain from such
                            measures and actions as will be prejudicial to the endeavors for the
                            restoration of general peace between Japan and China.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu called at my hotel apartment at his request. He had no
                            business to take up with me except to refer to the Japanese
                            interpretation of the Tripartite Pact and handed me a draft of a paper
                            which he proposed to sign by way of attempted clarification. I looked at
                            the paper and then asked Mr. Kurusu whether he had anything more on the
                            whole subject of a peaceful settlement to offer. He replied that he did
                            not. I said that I did not think this would be of any particular help
                            and so dismissed it. This was virtually all that was said of
                            importance.</p>

                                Excellency, I was rather surprised to learn that a deep-seated

                                Japan assumed under the Tripartite Pact.</p>

                            <p>Besides, as Article III of the Pact stands, Japan is in a position to
                                interpret its obligation freely and independently and is not to be
                                bound by the interpretation which the other high contracting parties
                                may make of it. I should like to add that my Government is not
                                obligated by the aforementioned treaty or any other international
                                engagement to become a collaborator or cooperator in any aggression
                                whatever by any third Power or Powers.</p>
                            <p>My Government would never project the people of Japan into war at the
                                behest of any foreign Power; it will accept warfare only as the
                                ultimate, inescapable necessity for the maintenance of its security
                                and the preservation of national life against active injustice.</p>
                            <p>I hope that the above statement will assist you in removing entirely
                                the popular suspicion which Your Excellency has repeatedly referred
                                to. I have to add that, when a complete Understanding is reached
                                between us, Your Excellency may feel perfectly free to publish the
                                present communication.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called at the Secretary’s
                            apartment by appointment made at the request of the Ambassador. The
                            Secretary said that he had called in the representatives of certain
                            other governments concerned in the Pacific area and that there had been
                            a discussion of the question of whether things (meaning Japanese
                            peaceful pledges, et cetera) could be developed in such a way that there
                            could be a relaxation to some extent of freezing. The Secretary said
                            that these representatives were interested in the suggestion and there
                            was a general feeling that the matter could all be settled if the
                            Japanese could give us some satisfactory evidences that their intentions
                            were peaceful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in discussing the situation with the
                            representatives of these other countries he found that there had arisen
                            in their minds the same kind of misgivings that had troubled him in the
                            course of the conversations with the Japanese Ambassador. He referred to
                            the position in which the Japanese Government had left the Ambassador
                            and the Secretary as they were talking of peace when it made its move
                            last July into Indochina. He referred also to the mounting oil purchases
                            by Japan last Spring when the conversations were in progress, to the
                            fact that he had endured public criticism for permitting those shipments
                            because he did not wish to prejudice a successful outcome to the
                            conversations and to the fact that that oil was not used for normal
                            civilian consumption.</p>
                        <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0824"/>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that the Japanese press which is adopting a
                            threatening tone gives him no encouragement and that no Japanese
                            statesmen are talking about a peaceful course, whereas in the American
                            press advocacy of a peaceful course can always get a hearing. He asked
                            why was there not some Japanese statesman backing the two Ambassadors by
                            preaching peace. The Secretary pointed out that if the United States and
                            other countries should see Japan coming along a peaceful course there
                            would be no question about Japan’s obtaining all the materials she
                            desired; that the Japanese Government knows that.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that while no decisions were reached today in regard
                            to the Japanese proposals he felt that we would consider helping Japan
                            out on oil for civilian requirements only as soon as the Japanese
                            Government could assert control of the situation in Japan as it relates
                            to the policy of force and conquest. He said that if the Ambassador
                            could give him any further assurances in regard to Japan’s peaceful
                            intentions it would help the Secretary in talking with senators and
                            other persons in this country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said it was unfortunate that there had been a special session
                            of the Diet at this time, as the efforts of the Government to obtain
                            public support had brought out in sharp relief the abnormal state of the
                            present temper of the Japanese people who had been affected by four
                            years of war and by our freezing measures.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked to what extent in the Ambassador’s opinion did the
                            firebrand attitude prevail in the Japanese army. Mr. Kurusu said that it
                            took a great deal of persuasion to induce the army to abandon a position
                            once taken, but that both he and the Ambassador had been pleasantly
                            surprised when the Japanese army acceded to their suggestion in regard
                            to offering to withdraw the Japanese troops from southern Indochina. He
                            said he thought this was an encouraging sign, but that nevertheless the
                            situation was approaching an explosive point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether it was not possible for a Japanese statesman
                            now to come out and say that Japan wanted peace; that while there was
                            much confusion in the world because of the war situation Japan would
                            like to have a peace which she did not have to fight for to obtain and
                            maintain; that the United States says it stands for such ideas; and that
                            Japan might well ask the United States for a show-down on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he did not have the slightest doubt that Japan
                            desired peace. He then cited the popular agitation in Japan following
                            the conclusion of the peace settlement with Russia in 1905, as pointing
                            to a difficulty in the way of publicly backing a conciliatory
                            course.</p>
                        <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0825"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether there was any way to get Japanese statesmen
                            to approach the question before us with real appreciation of the
                            situation with which we are dealing including the question of finding a
                            way to encourage the governments of other powers concerned in the
                            Pacific area to reach some trade arrangement with Japan. He pointed out
                            that Japan’s Indochina move, if repeated, would further give a spurt to
                            arming and thus undo all the work that he and the Ambassador had done.
                            He suggested that if the United States and the other countries should
                            supply Japan with goods in moderate amounts at the beginning those
                            countries would be inclined to satisfy Japan more fully later on if and
                            as Japan found ways in actual practice of demonstrating its peaceful
                            intentions. He said that one move on Japan’s part might kill dead our
                            peace effort, whereas it would be easy to persuade the other countries
                            to relax their export restrictions if Japan would be satisfied with
                            gradual relaxation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that at best it would take some time to get trade moving.
                            The Secretary replied that he understood this but that it would be
                            difficult to get other countries to understand until Japan could
                            convince those countries that it was committed to peaceful ways. Mr.
                            Kurusu said that some immediate relief was necessary and that if the
                            patient needed a thousand dollars to effect a cure an offer of three
                            hundred dollars would not accomplish the purpose. The Secretary
                            commented that if the Japanese Government was as weak as to need all
                            that had been asked for, nothing was likely to save it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that Japan’s offer to withdraw its forces from southern
                            Indochina would set a reverse movement in motion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Japanese were not helping as they should help
                            in the present situation in which they had got themselves but were
                            expecting us to do the whole thing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked what was the idea of the American Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that although the Japanese proposal was addressed
                            to the American Government he had thought it advisable to see whether
                            the other countries would contribute and he found that they would like
                            to move gradually. The effect of an arrangement between these countries
                            and Japan would be electrifying by showing that Japan had committed
                            herself to go along a peaceful course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked what Japan could do. The Secretary replied that if, for
                            example, he should say that he agreed to enter into a peaceful
                            settlement provided that there should be occasional exceptions and
                            qualifications he could not expect to find peaceful-minded nations
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether his understanding was correct that the
                            Japanese proposal was intended as a temporary step to help organize
                            public opinion in Japan and that it was intended to continue <pb n="760"
                                xml:id="pg_760" facs="0826"/>the conversations looking to the
                            conclusion of a comprehensive agreement. Mr. Kurusu said yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked whether the Secretary had any further suggestions. The
                            Secretary replied that he did not have in mind any suggestions and that
                            he did not know what amounts of exports the various countries would be
                            disposed to release to Japan. He said that Japan made the situation very
                            difficult, for if Japan left her forces in Indochina, whether in the
                            north, east, south or west, she would be able to move them over night,
                            and that therefore this would not relieve the apprehensions of
                            neighboring countries. The British, for example, would not be able to
                            move one warship away from Singapore.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador argued that it would take many days to move troops from
                            northern Indochina to southern Indochina, and he stated that the
                            Japanese desired the troops in northern Indochina in order to bring
                            about a settlement with China. He said that after the settlement of the
                            China affair Japan promised to bring the troops out of Indochina
                            altogether.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized again that he could not consider this, that also
                            uneasiness would prevail as long as the troops remained in Indochina,
                            and commented that Japan wanted the United States to do all the pushing
                            toward bringing about a peaceful settlement; that they should get out of
                            Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu observed that the Japanese Foreign Minister had told
                            Ambassador Grew that we seemed to expect that all the concessions should
                            be made by the Japanese side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary rejoined that Mr. Kurusu had overlooked the fact that in
                            July the Japanese had gone into Indochina. He added that the United
                            States had remained from the first in the middle of the road, that it
                            was the Japanese who had strayed away from the course of law and order,
                            and that they should not have to be paid to come back to a lawful
                            course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that this country’s denunciation of the commercial treaty
                            had caused Japan to be placed in a tight corner.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that Japan had cornered herself; that we had been
                            preaching for the last nine years that militarism was sapping everybody
                            and that if the world were to be plunged into another war there would
                            not be much left of the people anywhere. He said that in 1934 he had
                            told Ambassador Saito that Japan was planning an overlordship in East
                            Asia. The Secretary added that he had tried to persuade Hitler that
                            participation by him in a peaceful course would assure him of what he
                            needed. The Secretary said it was a pity that Japan could not do just a
                            few small peaceful things to help tide over the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu asked what the Secretary meant. The Secretary replied that the
                            major portion of our fleet was being kept in the Pacific <pb n="761"
                                xml:id="pg_761" facs="0827"/>and yet Japan asked us not to help
                            China. He said we must continue to aid China. He said it was little
                            enough that we were actually doing to help China. The Ambassador
                            commented that our moral influence was enabling Chiang to hold out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that a peaceful movement could be started in thirty or
                            forty days by moving gradually, and yet Japan pushed everything it
                            wanted all at once into its proposal. The Ambassador explained that
                            Japan needed a quick settlement and that its psychological value would
                            be great.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was discouraged, that he felt that he had
                            rendered a real contribution when he had called in the representatives
                            of the other countries, but that he could only go a certain distance. He
                            said he thought nevertheless that if this matter should move in the
                            right way peace would become infectious. He pointed also to the danger
                            arising from blocking progress by injecting the China matter in the
                            proposal, as the carrying out of such a point in the Japanese proposal
                            would effectually prevent the United States from ever successfully
                            extending its good offices in a peace settlement between Japan and
                            China. He said this could not be considered now.</p>
                        <p>There then ensued some further but inconclusive discussion of the troop
                            situation in Indochina, the Secretary still standing for withdrawal,
                            after which the Ambassador reverted to the desire of the Japanese
                            Government to reach a quick settlement and asked whether we could not
                            say what points in the Japanese proposal we would accept and what points
                            we desired to have modified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that there was no way in which he could carry
                            the whole burden and suggested that it would be helpful if the Japanese
                            Government could spend a little time preaching peace. He said that if
                            the Japanese could not wait until Monday<note n="62" xml:id="d405fn62"
                                >November 24, 1941.</note> before having his answer there was
                            nothing he could do about it as he was obliged to confer again with the
                            representatives of the other governments concerned after they had had an
                            opportunity to consult with their governments. He repeated that we were
                            doing our best, but emphasized that unless the Japanese were able to do
                            a little there was no use in talking.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador disclaimed any desire to press the Secretary too hard for
                            an answer, agreed that the Secretary had always been most considerate in
                            meeting with the Ambassador whenever an appointment had been requested,
                            and said that the Japanese would be quite ready to wait until
                            Monday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had in mind taking up with the Ambassador sometime
                            a general and comprehensive program which we had been engaged in
                            developing and which involved collaboration of other countries.</p>
                        <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0828"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Japanese had in mind negotiating a bilateral
                            agreement with us to which other powers could subsequently give their
                            adherence.</p>

                        <p>1839. The Ambassador reports for Secretary Hull and Under Secretary
                            Welles concerning his call on Foreign Minister Togo this afternoon at
                            the request of the latter as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Foreign Minister asked the Ambassador if he was familiar
                                    with the Japanese proposal which was presented on November 20 to
                                    the Department and if he was informed of the conversation in
                                    substance on November 22 when the proposal was discussed during
                                    a call on the Secretary of State by the Japanese Ambassador and
                                    Saburo Kurusu. In reply the Ambassador stated that the Japanese
                                    proposal had been reported to him, though not the conversation
                                    of November 22 as yet. Togo then informed the Ambassador that
                                    Secretary Hull had said he had been consulting with the
                                    representatives of other interested Governments and the item
                                    respecting withdrawal from Southern Indochina of Japanese troops
                                    was not satisfactory. Togo continued that Japan made the offer
                                    out of sincere solicitude to maintain peace in the Pacific and
                                    from anxiety for a way to be found out of the existing difficult
                                    situation. Togo said Japan could not withdraw its forces at this
                                    time from Northern Indochina because they were despatched there
                                    to hasten the China affair’s conclusion. The Minister recalled
                                    that the United States and Great Britain had instituted the
                                    freezing orders because the stationing in Southern Indochina of
                                    Japanese troops was looked upon as a threat to British and
                                    American security. He remarked that withdrawing Japanese troops
                                    to Northern Indochina evidences Japanese desire for the
                                    promotion of a successful conclusion of what he called
                                    “negotiations” with the United States. Togo said the withdrawal
                                    of Japanese troops at present stationed in French Indochina to
                                    the northern part is in any event the maximum concession Japan
                                    can make.</item>

                                <item>The Minister proceeded to comment that one of the serious
                                    obstacles to concluding the present negotiations successfully is
                                    undeniably the divergence of views of the United States and
                                    Japan <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0829"/>regarding
                                    settlement of the China affair. Togo recalled President
                                    Roosevelt’s query sometime ago of the Japanese Ambassador as to
                                    what Japan’s attitude would be should General Chiang Kai-shek
                                    issue a statement of desire to restore peace with Japan,
                                    whereupon the Japanese Government answered that it would be glad
                                    for the United States to act as an “introducer” to open the way
                                    for direct Japanese-Chinese negotiations. Minister Togo then
                                    said if Chiang Kai-shek made a statement as suggested, the
                                    Japanese Government’s response would be a statement in similar
                                    vein. Japan would be ready thereupon at once to enter into
                                    negotiations with China, with the understanding that then the
                                    United States would refrain from action prejudicial to restoring
                                    peace between China and Japan. Togo stated his inability to
                                    appreciate the reasons given by the Secretary of State for not
                                    accepting the recent Japanese proposal. Remembering Japan’s
                                    sacrifices to date, Togo declared it is not possible
                                    successfully to conclude the negotiations without reaching an
                                    understanding regarding the cessation by the United States of
                                    activities which obstruct a restoration of peace. At this point
                                    the Ambassador interrupted the Foreign Minister to say it was
                                    not clear to him at what point Japan expects such American
                                    activities to cease. Togo replied that he would like President
                                    Roosevelt’s suggestion to become a reality. The Foreign Minister
                                    wished it to be made clear that Japan expects the cessation of
                                    the activities to which he referred as soon as China and Japan
                                    begin negotiations, which would occur immediately after General
                                    Chiang Kai-shek makes the statement outlined above and after an
                                    affirmative response thereto by Japan. Togo said he was
                                    unfamiliar with military matters, but it appeared to him that
                                    normally hostilities would cease as soon as negotiations were
                                    started looking to peace being restored, thereby logically
                                    bringing about a situation when it would be unnecessary to have
                                    American action which is calculated to aid Chinese military
                                    forces.</item>

                                <item>Togo informed the Ambassador that he was the one who
                                    formulated and became responsible for the Japanese proposal
                                    presented on November 20 to the United States Government. This
                                    proposal was presented as a manifestation of Japan’s desire for
                                    cooperation with the American policy of peace. Togo assured the
                                    Ambassador that the same cooperative spirit is to prompt Japan’s
                                    future policy, which is to be conducted with growing clarity in
                                    pursuit of peaceful aims.</item>

                                    Foreign Minister was to assure him that his observations would
                                    be promptly transmitted to the United States Government.</item>

                                <item>By way of comment, the Ambassador offers the suggestion that,
                                    in case the Japanese Government does not expect suspension of

                                    settle the China affair) would appear to be largely to save

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called by appointment at the
                            Department. The Secretary handed each of the Japanese copies of an
                            outline of a proposed basis of an agreement between the United States
                            and Japan<note n="64" xml:id="d407fn64"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>,
                                    <ref target="#pg_768">p. 768</ref>.</note> and an explanatory
                            oral statement.<note n="65" xml:id="d407fn65"><hi rend="italic"

                        <p>After the Japanese had read the documents, Mr. Kurusu asked whether this
                            was our reply to their proposal for a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>. The Secretary replied that we had to treat the
                            proposal as we did, as there was so much turmoil and confusion among the
                            public both in the United States and in Japan. He reminded the Japanese
                            that in the United States we have a political situation to deal with
                            just as does the Japanese Government, and he referred to the fire-eating
                            statements which have been recently coming out of Tokyo, which he said
                            had been causing a natural reaction among the public in this country. He
                            said that our proposed agreement would render possible practical
                            measures of financial cooperation, which, however, were not referred to
                            in the outline for fear that this might give rise to misunderstanding.
                            He also referred to the fact that he had earlier in the conversations
                            acquainted the Ambassador of the ambition that had been his of settling
                            the immigration question but that the situation had so far prevented him
                            from realizing that ambition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu offered various depreciatory comments in regard to the
                            proposed agreement. He noted that in our statement of principles there
                            was a reiteration of the Stimson doctrine.<note n="66" xml:id="d407fn66"

                            multilateral non-aggression pacts and referred to Japan’s bitter
                            experience of international organizations, citing the case of the award
                            against Japan by the Hague tribunal in the Perpetual Leases matter.<note

                            Treaties had given a wrong idea to China, that China had taken advantage
                            of them to flaunt Japan’s rights. He said he did not see how his
                            Government could consider paragraphs (3) and (4) of the proposed
                            agreement and that if the United States should expect <pb n="765"
                                xml:id="pg_765" facs="0831"/>that Japan was to take off its hat to
                            Chiang Kai-shek and propose to recognize him Japan could not agree. He
                            said that if this was the idea of the American Government he did not see
                            how any agreement was possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether this matter could not be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that when they reported our answer to their Government it
                            would be likely to throw up its hands. He noted that this was a
                            tentative proposal without commitment, and suggested that it might be
                            better if they did not refer it to their Government before discussing
                            its contents further informally here.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that they might wish to study the documents
                            carefully before discussing them further. He repeated that we were
                            trying to do our best to keep the public from becoming uneasy as a
                            result of their being harangued. He explained that in the light of all
                            that has been said in the press, our proposal was as far as we would go
                            at this time in reference to the Japanese proposal; that there was so
                            much confusion among the public that it was necessary to bring about
                            some clarification; that we have reached a stage when the public has
                            lost its perspective and that it was therefore necessary to draw up a
                            document which would present a complete picture of our position by
                            making provision for each essential point involved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the oil question. He said that public
                            feeling was so acute on that question that he might almost be lynched if
                            he permitted oil to go freely to Japan. He pointed out that if Japan
                            should fill Indochina with troops our people would not know what lies
                            ahead in the way of a menace to the countries to the south and west. He
                            reminded the Japanese that they did not know what tremendous injury they
                            were doing to us by keeping immobilized so many forces in countries
                            neighboring Indochina. He explained that we are primarily out for our
                            permanent futures, and the question of Japanese troops in Indochina
                            affects our direct interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu reverted to the difficulty of Japan’s renouncing its support
                            of Wang Ching-wei. The Secretary pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek had
                            made an outstanding contribution in bringing out national spirit in
                            China and expressed the view that the Nanking regime had not asserted
                            itself in a way that would impress the world. Mr. Kurusu agreed with
                            what the Secretary had said about Chiang, but observed that the question
                            of the standing of the Nanking regime was a matter of opinion. His
                            arguments on this as well as on various other points were specious, and
                            unconvincing.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador took the occasion to observe that sometimes statesmen of
                            firm conviction fail to get sympathizers among the public; <pb n="766"
                                xml:id="pg_766" facs="0832"/>that only wise men could see far ahead
                            and sometimes suffered martyrdom; but that life’s span was short and one
                            could only do his duty. The Ambassador then asked whether there was no
                            other possibility and whether they could not see the President.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had no doubt that the President would be
                            glad to see them at any time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that he felt that our response to their proposal could be
                            interpreted as tantamount to meaning the end, and asked whether we were
                            not interested in a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had explored that. Mr. Kurusu asked whether
                            it was because the other powers would not agree; but the Secretary
                            replied simply that he had done his best in the way of exploration.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador when rising to go raised the question of publicity. The
                            Secretary replied that he had it in mind to give the press something of
                            the situation tomorrow, and asked what the Ambassador thought. The
                            Ambassador said that they did not wish to question the Secretary’s right
                            to give out what he desired in regard to the American proposal. The
                            Ambassador said he would like to have Mr. Wakasugi call on Mr.
                            Ballantine on Thursday to discuss further details.</p>

                        <p>The representatives of the Government of the United States and of the
                            Government of Japan have been carrying on during the past several months
                            informal and exploratory conversations for the purpose of arriving at a
                            settlement if possible of questions relating to the entire Pacific area
                            based upon the principles of peace, law and order and fair dealing among
                            nations. These principles include the principle of inviolability of
                            territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations; the
                            principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other
                            countries; the principle of equality, including equality of commercial
                            opportunity and treatment; and the principle of reliance upon
                            international cooperation and conciliation for the prevention and
                            pacific settlement of controversies and for improvement of international
                            conditions by peaceful methods and processes.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that in our discussions some progress has been made in
                            reference to the general principles which constitute the basis of a
                            peaceful settlement covering the entire Pacific area. Recently the <pb
                                n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0833"/>Japanese Ambassador has stated
                            that the Japanese Government is desirous of continuing the conversations
                            directed toward a comprehensive and peaceful settlement in the Pacific
                            area; that it would be helpful toward creating an atmosphere favorable
                            to the successful outcome of the conversations if a temporary <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> could be agreed upon to be in
                            effect while the conversations looking to a peaceful settlement in the
                            Pacific were continuing. On November 20 the Japanese Ambassador
                            communicated to the Secretary of State proposals in regard to temporary
                            measures to be taken respectively by the Government of Japan and by the
                            Government of the United States, which measures are understood to have
                            been designed to accomplish the purposes above indicated.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States most earnestly desires to contribute
                            to the promotion and maintenance of peace and stability in the Pacific
                            area, and to afford every opportunity for the continuance of discussions
                            with the Japanese Government directed toward working out a broad-gauge
                            program of peace throughout the Pacific area. The proposals which were
                            presented by the Japanese Ambassador on November 20 contain some
                            features which, in the opinion of this Government, conflict with the
                            fundamental principles which form a part of the general settlement under
                            consideration and to which each Government has declared that it is
                            committed. The Government of the United States believes that the
                            adoption of such proposals would not be likely to contribute to the
                            ultimate objectives of ensuring peace under law, order and justice in
                            the Pacific area, and it suggests that further effort be made to resolve
                            our divergences of views in regard to the practical application of the
                            fundamental principles already mentioned.</p>
                        <p>With this object in view the Government of the United States offers for
                            the consideration of the Japanese Government a plan of a broad but
                            simple settlement covering the entire Pacific area as one practical
                            exemplification of a program which this Government envisages as
                            something to be worked out during our further conversations.</p>
                        <p>The plan therein suggested represents an effort to bridge the gap between
                            our draft of June 21, 1941 and the Japanese draft of September 25 by
                            making a new approach to the essential problems underlying a
                            comprehensive Pacific settlement. This plan contains provisions dealing
                            with the practical application of the fundamental principles which we
                            have agreed in our conversations constitute the only sound basis for
                            worthwhile international relations. We hope that in this way progress
                            toward reaching a meeting of minds between our two Governments may be
                            expedited.</p>

                        <p>The two Japanese Ambassadors called at their request. The President
                            opened the conversation with some reference to German international
                            psychology. Ambassador Nomura then said that they were disappointed
                            about the failure of any agreement regarding a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>. The President proceeded to express the grateful
                            appreciation of himself and of this Government to the peace element in
                            Japan which has worked hard in support of the movement to establish a
                            peaceful settlement in the Pacific area. He made it clear that we were
                            not overlooking for a moment what that element has done and is ready
                            still to do. The President added that in the United States most people
                            want a peaceful solution of all matters in the Pacific area. He said
                            that he does not give up yet although the situation is serious and that
                            fact should be recognized. He then referred to the conversations since
                            April which have been carried on here with the Japanese Ambassador in an
                            attempt to deal with the difficulties. The President added that some of
                            these difficulties at times have the effect of a cold bath on the United
                            States Government and people, such as the recent occupation of Indochina
                            by the Japanese and recent movements and utterances of the Japanese
                            slanting wholly in the direction of conquest by force and ignoring the
                            whole question of a peaceful settlement and the principles underlying
                            it. The President then made the following points: <pb n="771"

                                <item>We have been very much disappointed that during the course of
                                    these very important conversations Japanese leaders have
                                    continued to express opposition to the fundamental principles of
                                    peace and order which constitute the central spirit of the
                                    conversations which we have been carrying on. This attitude on
                                    the part of Japanese leaders has naturally created an atmosphere
                                    both in this country and abroad which has added greatly to the
                                    difficulty of making mutually satisfactory progress in the
                                    conversations.</item>

                                <item>We have been very patient in our dealing with the whole Far
                                    Eastern situation. We are prepared to continue to be patient if
                                    Japan’s courses of action permit continuance of such an attitude
                                    on our part. We still have hope that there may be worked out a
                                    peaceful settlement in the entire Pacific area of the character
                                    we have been discussing. The temper of public opinion in this
                                    country has become of such a character and the big issues at
                                    stake in the world today have become so sharply outlined that
                                    this country cannot bring about any substantial relaxation in
                                    its economic restrictions unless Japan gives this country some
                                    clear manifestation of peaceful intent. If that occurs, we can
                                    also take some steps of a concrete character designed to improve
                                    the general situation.</item>

                                <item>We remain convinced that Japan’s own best interests will not
                                    be served by following Hitlerism and courses of aggression, and
                                    that Japan’s own best interests lie along the courses which we
                                    have outlined in the current conversations. If, however, Japan
                                    should unfortunately decide to follow Hitlerism and courses of
                                    aggression, we are convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that
                                    Japan will be the ultimate loser.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that the leaders in Japan had obstructed this
                            whole movement involved in the conversations here. He said that having
                            been in war for four years the Japanese people need to have a peace
                            tempo; that war does not help us nor would it help Japan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kurusu proceeded to say that he had been here for ten days in
                            an endeavor to discuss and develop a peaceful arrangement; that the
                            trouble was not with the fundamentals so much as with their application.
                            Referring to a recent remark of the President about introducing Japan
                            and China, Kurusu asked to know who would request the President to
                            introduce these two governments. The President promptly replied “both
                            sides”. He then gave an illustration of his dealing with some strike
                            conditions when neither side desired to request the Mediation Board to
                            bring up the matter but were anxious, without saying so, for the
                            President to do so. I referred to the 250,000 carpetbaggers that had
                            gone into north China following the army and said that they had seized
                            other peoples’ rights and properties and located there as the
                            carpetbaggers had done in the south after the Civil War and added that
                            they had no rights over there and ought to give up the property they
                            took from other people and get out.</p>
                        <p>The President, referring to the efforts of Japan to colonize countries
                                <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0838"/>that they conquer, said
                            that Germany would completely fail because she did not have enough top
                            people to govern the fifteen or more conquered countries in Europe and
                            that this would cause Germany to fail in her present movements; that
                            second class people cannot run fifteen captured countries.</p>
                        <p>The President further referred to the matter of encirclement that Japan
                            has been alleging. He pointed out that the Philippines were being
                            encircled by Japan so far as that is concerned.</p>
                        <p>I made it clear that unless the opposition to the peace element in
                            control of the Government should make up its mind definitely to act and
                            talk and move in a peaceful direction, no conversations could or would
                            get anywhere as has been so clearly demonstrated; that everyone knows
                            that the Japanese slogans of co-prosperity, new order in East Asia and a
                            controlling influence in certain areas, are all terms to express in a
                            camouflaged manner the policy of force and conquest by Japan and the
                            domination by military agencies of the political, economic, social and
                            moral affairs of each of the populations conquered; and that so long as
                            they move in that direction and continue to increase their cultural
                            relations, military and otherwise with Hitler through such instruments
                            as the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Tripartite Pact, et cetera, et
                            cetera, there could not be any real progress made on a peaceful
                            course.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called at their request at the
                            Department. Mr. Kurusu said that he noted that the President was
                            returning to Washington in advance of his schedule and inquired what the
                            reason for this was. The Secretary indicated that one of the factors in
                            the present situation was the loud talk of the Japanese Prime
                                Minister.<note n="67a" xml:id="d411fn67a">For speech by General
                                Tojo, see telegram No. 1869, December 1, 1941, 3 p.m., from the
                                Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_148">p. 148</ref>.</note> The
                            Secretary added that the Prime Minister seemed to be in need of advice
                            which would deter him from indulging in such talk at a time when the
                            Ambassador was here talking about good relations. The Secretary then
                            asked the Japanese how they felt about the general trend in the world
                            situation, especially the situation in Libya and Russia. The Japanese
                            Ambassador replied to the effect that their attention had been largely
                            engrossed in the situation as between the United States and Japan. The
                            Secretary observed that from our point of view we felt much interest in
                            and were very much encouraged about the news from Libya and Russia and
                            it looked as if we might be turning the corner into a more favorable
                            situation.</p>
                        <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0839"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu endeavored to convince the Secretary that
                            in this country we seem to take a more serious view of the Japanese
                            Prime Minister’s utterances than was warranted. Mr. Kurusu said that
                            what the Prime Minister had done was nothing more than a ten-minute
                            broadcast. The Secretary pointed out that a broadcast was all the more
                            effective. Mr. Kurusu said that the Prime Minister had been misquoted
                            and asked whether we had heard anything from Ambassador Grew. The
                            Secretary replied that we had heard nothing from Ambassador Grew and
                            that we felt that the Associated Press was reliable and that we should
                            give credence to its reports of what the Prime Minister said. Mr. Kurusu
                            said that Japanese news services did not always correctly translate
                            statements into English.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had been talking peace for nine months with
                            the Japanese Ambassador, both of them acting in entire good faith. He
                            said that during all the time that Matsuoka was holding forth on the
                            Tripartite Alliance and engaging in general bluster, the Secretary had
                            ignored all of that. Then while the talks were in progress last July the
                            Japanese moved suddenly into Indochina without any advance notice to
                            this Government, and possibly the Ambassador was not informed of the
                            Japanese Government’s intention in advance. Then, too, the Secretary
                            said, the Japanese press had been conducting a blustering campaign
                            against the United States. The Secretary said that this Government had
                            no idea of trying to bluff Japan and he saw no occasion for Japan’s
                            trying to bluff us, and he emphasized that there is a limit beyond which
                            we cannot go further and that one of these days we may reach a point
                            when we cannot keep on as we are.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that the Japanese Government had been very much surprised
                            at the reaction in this country to the Prime Minister’s statements and
                            he would see to it that the Secretary was given a correct translation of
                            the Prime Minister’s statements. He said he hoped we would get something
                            from Ambassador Grew. He then said that he was pleased to inform the
                            Secretary that the document we had given them on November 26 had been
                            communicated to the Japanese Government, that the Japanese Government is
                            giving the case study, and that within a few days the Japanese
                            Government’s observation thereon would be communicated to us. He then
                            said that the Japanese Government believed that the proposal which they
                            submitted to us on November 20 was equitable and that full consideration
                            had been given therein to the points of view taken by both sides in the
                            conversations; that the Japanese Government finds it difficult to
                            understand the position taken by the Government of the United States;
                            and that the proposal which we had communicated to them seemed <pb
                                n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0840"/>to fail to take cognizance of
                            the actual conditions in the Far East. He said that his Government
                            directed him to inquire what was the ultimate aim of the United States
                            in the conversations and to request this Government to make “deep
                            reflection of this matter”. Mr. Kurusu said that the Japanese offer to
                            withdraw its troops from southern Indochina still stands; that Japan has
                            shown its extreme desire to promote a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had to take into account the bellicose
                            utterances emanating from Tokyo and that never would there be possible
                            any peaceful arrangements if such arrangements have to be based upon
                            principles of force. He pointed out that the methods the Japanese are
                            using in China are similar to those which are being adopted by Hitler to
                            subjugate Europe. The Secretary said that he had called attention to
                            that during the progress of our conversations and that we cannot lose
                            sight of the movement by Hitler to seize one-half of the world. He said
                            that we believe that the Japanese militarists are moving in a similar
                            direction to seize the other half of the earth, and that this Government
                            cannot yield to anything of that kind. He explained that this is why we
                            desire to work things out in a way that would promote peace, stability
                            and prosperity and that this is why he has thus far made no complaint,
                            notwithstanding the fact that the Japanese press has heaped filthy abuse
                            on this country.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the view that as a matter of fact there is not
                            much difference between Japan’s idea of a co-prosperity sphere and
                            Pan-Americanism, except that Japanese methods may be more primitive. He
                            denied that it was Japan’s purpose to use force. The Secretary asked
                            whether, when the Japanese Government was moving on the territory of
                            other countries, inch by inch by force, the Ambassador thought that this
                            was a part of our policy. The Ambassador replied that Japan was
                            motivated by self-defense in the same way as Britain had been motivated
                            by her acts, for example, in Syria; that Japan needed rice and other
                            materials at a time when she was being shut off by the United States and
                            other countries and she had no alternative but to endeavor to obtain
                            access to these materials.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the Japanese are saying that the United
                            States has no right to interfere with what Japan is doing in eastern
                            Asia; that when the Japanese keep their troops in Indochina this
                            constitutes a menace to the South Sea area, irrespective of where in
                            Indochina the troops are stationed; that the stationing of these troops
                            in Indochina is making it necessary for the United States and its
                            friends to keep large numbers of armed forces immobilized in east Asia,
                            and in this way Japan’s acts were having the effect of aiding Hitler.
                            The Secretary reminded the Ambassador that he had made it clear to the
                            Ambassador that we could not sit still while such developments were
                            taking place.</p>
                        <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0841"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that today war is being conducted through the
                            agency of economic weapons, that Japan was being squeezed, and that
                            Japan must expand to obtain raw materials. The Secretary pointed out
                            that we were selling Japan oil until Japan suddenly moved into
                            Indochina; that he could not defend such a situation indefinitely; and
                            that the United States would give Japan all she wanted in the way of
                            materials if Japan’s military leaders would only show that Japan
                            intended to pursue a peaceful course. The Secretary emphasized that we
                            do not propose to go into partnership with Japan’s military leaders;
                            that he has not heard one whisper of peace from the Japanese military,
                            only bluster and blood-curdling threats. The Secretary added that he had
                            been subjected to very severe criticism for his policy of patience but
                            that he would not mind if only the Japanese Government could back him
                            up.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to enumerate various points in the Japanese
                            proposal of November 20. He reminded the Ambassador that on November 22
                            he had promptly told the Ambassador that we could not sell oil to the
                            Japanese Navy, although we might be prepared to consider the release of
                            some oil for civilian purposes. He made it clear that this Government
                            was anxious to help settle the China affair if the Japanese could reach
                            a settlement in accordance with the basic principles which we had
                            discussed in our conversations, and that under such circumstances we
                            would be glad to offer our good offices. The Secretary went on to say
                            that under existing circumstances, when Japan was tied in with the
                            Tripartite Pact, Japan might just as well ask us to cease aiding Britain
                            as to cease aiding China. He emphasized again that we can’t overlook
                            Japan’s digging herself into Indochina, the effect of which is to create
                            an increasing menace to America and her friends; that we can’t continue
                            to take chances on the situation; and that we will not allow ourselves
                            to be kicked out of the Pacific. The Secretary called attention to
                            reports that we have received from the press and other sources of heavy
                            Japanese troop movements into Indochina and endeavored to make it clear
                            that, when a large Japanese army is anywhere in Indochina, we have to
                            give that situation all the more attention when Japanese statesmen say
                            that they will drive us out of east Asia. He pointed out that we cannot
                            be sure what the Japanese military leaders are likely to do, that we do
                            not know where the Japanese Army intends to land its forces, and that
                            for this reason we cannot sit still but will have to puzzle these things
                            out in some way. The Secretary explained that this situation had been
                            very painful to him and he did not know whether the Ambassador could do
                            anything in the matter of influencing the Japanese Government. Mr.
                            Kurusu said that he felt it was a shame that nothing should come out of
                            the efforts which the conversations of several months had represented.
                            He said he felt <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0842"/>that the two
                            sides had once been near an agreement except for two or three points,
                            but that our latest proposals seem to carry the two sides further away
                            than before.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that every time we get started in the direction
                            of progress the Japanese military does something to overturn us. The
                            Secretary expressed grave doubts whether we could now get ahead in view
                            of all the threats that had been made. He pointed out that the acts of
                            the Japanese militarists had effectively tied the hands of the
                            Ambassadors and he did not know whether the Ambassadors could succeed in
                            having anything accomplished toward untying their hands. Mr. Kurusu
                            brought up again his contention made on previous occasions that China
                            had taken advantage of the Washington Conference treaties to flaunt
                            Japan, and commented that if we don’t look out China will sell both the
                            United States and Japan down the river. The Secretary observed that he
                            has been plowing through various contradictions in Japanese acts and
                            utterances. He pointed out that the Japanese had been telling us that if
                            something quick is not done something awful was about to happen; that
                            they kept urging upon the Secretary the danger of delay, and kept
                            pressing the Secretary to do something. He said that in view of all the
                            confusion, threats and pressure, he had been brought to the stage where
                            he felt that something must be done to clear the foggy atmosphere; that
                            his conclusion was that he must bring us back to fundamentals; and that
                            these fundamentals were embodied in the proposal which we had offered
                            the Japanese on November 26. He said that we have stood from the first
                            on the points involved in this proposal. He pointed out that everything
                            that Japan was doing and saying was in precisely the opposite direction
                            from the course we have been talking about in our conversations, and
                            that these should be reversed by his government before we can further
                            seriously talk peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu endeavored to make some lame apology for the direct military
                            mind of the Japanese Army and commented that General Tojo was in
                            position to control the situation. The Secretary asked what possibility
                            there was of peace-minded people coming out in Japan and expressing
                            themselves. He expressed doubt whether anybody in Japan would be free to
                            speak unless he preached conquest. The Ambassador commented that the
                            Japanese people are not talking about conquest. The Secretary pointed
                            out that we all understand what are the implications of such terms as
                            “controlling influence”, “new order in east Asia”, and “co-prosperity
                            sphere”. The Secretary observed that Hitler was using similar terms as
                            synonyms for purposes of conquest. The Secretary went on to say that
                            there was no reason for conflict between the United States and Japan,
                            that there was no <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0843"/>real clash of
                            interests. He added that Japan does not have to use a sword to gain for
                            herself a seat at the head of the table. He pointed out that equality of
                            opportunity is in our opinion the key to the future peace and prosperity
                            of all nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu disclaimed on the part of Japan any similarity between Japan’s
                            purposes and Hitler’s purposes. The Ambassador pointed out that wars
                            never settle anything and that war in the Pacific would be a tragedy,
                            but he added that the Japanese people believe that the United States
                            wants to keep Japan fighting with China and to keep Japan strangled. He
                            said that the Japanese people feel that they are faced with the
                            alternative of surrendering to the United States or of fighting. The
                            Ambassador said that he was still trying to save the situation. The
                            Secretary said that he has practically exhausted himself here, that the
                            American people are going to assume that there is real danger to this
                            country in the situation, and that there is nothing he can do to prevent
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassadors said that they understood the Secretary’s position in the
                            light of his statements and they would report the matter to the Japanese
                            Government with a view to seeing what could be done.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Terasaki said that he had been greatly distressed by the newspaper
                            reports of the so-called Tojo speech on November 30 and handed Mr.
                            Schmidt a copy of the document he had previously given Mr. Ballantine (a
                            copy is attached).<note n="68" xml:id="d412fn68"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Infra</hi>.</note> Mr. Terasaki said that he had, immediately
                            after noticing the press reaction in this country to the statements
                            attributed to Premier Tojo, telegraphed to his Government deprecating
                            remarks of that sort by the Prime Minister during the course of
                            conversations here in Washington. Mr. Terasaki said that both he and his
                            Government had been “flabbergasted” and went on to say that he had been
                            greatly relieved to receive last night from Tokyo the message he had
                            given Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Schmidt.</p>
                        <p>Stating that his remarks were confidential and off the record Mr.
                            Terasaki said that when Mr. Kurusu had talked with Mr. Yamamoto, Chief
                            of the American Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Office, last Sunday night
                            and had referred to the speech which General Tojo had made, Mr. Yamamoto
                            had been nonplused and had asked “What speech”.</p>
                        <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0844"/>
                        <p>Mr. Terasaki referred to his request to Mr. Ballantine that Mr.
                            Ballantine inform him as to the manner in which the Department desired
                            the Japanese explanation of General Tojo’s speech to be made public. Mr.
                            Terasaki asked Mr. Schmidt if he would remind Mr. Ballantine to get in
                            touch with Mr. Terasaki as soon as he had any information on this

                        <p>The so-called speech of Premier Hideki Tojo was originally drafted by
                            members of the office staff of the East Asia Restoration League, a
                            non-governmental organization of which Mr. Tojo happens to be President,
                            as a congratulatory address to be delivered on November 30, on the
                            occasion commemorating the first anniversary of the conclusion of the
                            Treaty Concerning the Basic Relations between Japan and China,<note
                                n="68a" xml:id="d413fn68a">Treaty signed with Wang Ching-wei at

                                117</ref>.</note> under the auspices of the said League.</p>
                        <p>However, November 30 happened to be Sunday; the League staff gave out the
                            manuscript to the newspaper reporters upon their request on the night of
                            November 29 (Saturday), before the said draft was examined by either the
                            Premier himself or other Government officials, and this unapproved
                            manuscript was printed in the metropolitan newspapers.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the Premier himself made no speech of any kind on
                            the 30th. Moreover, neither the Premier nor other government authorities
                            had any knowledge as to the content of the said speech.</p>
                        <p>It should further be noted that the reported statement “For the honor and
                            pride of mankind we must purge this sort of practice from East Asia with
                            a vengeance” is a mistranslation of the original text. There is, in the
                            original text, no such expression as “purge” or “with a vengeance.” The
                            correct translation of the statement should be “For the honor and pride
                            of mankind, this sort of practice must be removed.”</p>

                        <p>The Under Secretary said that the Secretary was absent from the
                            Department because of a slight indisposition and that the President had
                            therefore asked Mr. Welles to request the Japanese Ambassador <pb
                                n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0845"/>and Mr. Kurusu to call to
                            receive a communication which the President wished to make to them. Mr.
                            Welles then read to Their Excellencies the following statement (a copy
                            of which was handed to the Ambassador): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have received reports during the past days of continuing
                                    Japanese troop movements to southern Indochina. These reports
                                    indicate a very rapid and material increase in the forces of all
                                    kinds stationed by Japan in Indochina.</p>
                                <p>“It was my clear understanding that by the terms of the
                                    agreement—and there is no present need to discuss the nature of
                                    that agreement—between Japan and the French Government at Vichy
                                    that the total number of Japanese forces permitted by the terms
                                    of that agreement to be stationed in Indochina was very
                                    considerably less than the total amount of the forces already
                                    there.</p>
                                <p>“The stationing of these increased Japanese forces in Indochina
                                    would seem to imply the utilization of these forces by Japan for
                                    purposes of further aggression, since no such number of forces
                                    could possibly be required for the policing of that region. Such
                                    aggression could conceivably be against the Philippine Islands;
                                    against the many islands of the East Indies; against Burma;
                                    against Malaya or either through coercion or through the actual
                                    use of force for the purpose of undertaking the occupation of
                                    Thailand. Such new aggression would, of course, be additional to
                                    the acts of aggression already undertaken against China, our
                                    attitude towards which is well known, and has been repeatedly
                                    stated to the Japanese Government.</p>
                                <p>“Please be good enough to request the Japanese Ambassador and
                                    Ambassador Kurusu to inquire at once of the Japanese Government
                                    what the actual reasons may be for the steps already taken, and
                                    what I am to consider is the policy of the Japanese Government
                                    as demonstrated by this recent and rapid concentration of troops
                                    in Indochina. This Government has seen in the last few years in
                                    Europe a policy on the part of the German Government which has
                                    involved a constant and steady encroachment upon the territory
                                    and rights of free and independent peoples through the
                                    utilization of military steps of the same character. It is for
                                    that reason and because of the broad problem of American defense
                                    that I should like to know the intention of the Japanese
                                    Government.”</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador said that he was not informed by the Japanese
                            Government of its intentions and could not speak authoritatively on the
                            matter but that of course he would communicate the statement immediately
                            to his Government. Mr. Kurusu said that, in view of Japan’s offer of
                            November 20 to transfer all its forces from southern Indochina to
                            northern Indochina, it was obvious no threat against the United States
                            was intended. Both Mr. Kurusu and the Ambassador endeavored to explain
                            that owing to lack of adequate land communication facilities in
                            Indochina a rapid transfer of forces from northern to southern Indochina
                            for purposes of aggression against countries neighboring southern
                            Indochina could not be easily effected. Mr. Kurusu asked whether the
                            reports to which the President referred <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780"
                                facs="0846"/>were from our authorities. Mr. Welles said that he was
                            not in position to say any more on that point than was contained in the
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it appeared to him that the measures which Japan
                            was taking were natural under the circumstances, as the strengthening of
                            armaments and of military dispositions by one side naturally leads to
                            increasing activity by the other side. Mr. Welles stated that, as the
                            Japanese Ambassador must be fully aware, this Government has not had any
                            aggressive intention against Japan. The Ambassador said that, while he
                            did not wish to enter into a debate on the matter, he wished to point
                            out that the Japanese people believe that economic measures are a much
                            more effective weapon of war than military measures; that they believe
                            they are being placed under severe pressure by the United States to
                            yield to the American position; and that it is preferable to fight
                            rather than to yield to pressure. The Ambassador added that this was a
                            situation in which wise statesmanship was needed; that wars do not
                            settle anything; and that under the circumstances some agreement, even
                            though it is not satisfactory, is better than no agreement at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles pointed out that the settlement which we are offering Japan is
                            one which would assure Japan of peace and the satisfaction of Japan’s
                            economic needs much more certainly than any other alternative which
                            Japan might feel was open to her.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that having just recently arrived from Japan he could
                            speak more accurately of the frame of mind which is prevalent in Japan
                            than could the Ambassador. He dwelt briefly upon the reaction which has
                            been caused in Japan by our freezing measures and he said that this
                            produces a frame of mind which has to be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles pointed out that, as the Ambassadors must fully understand,
                            there is a frame of mind in this country also which must be taken into
                            account, and that frame of mind is produced by the effect of four years
                            of the measures taken by Japan in China causing the squeezing out of
                            American interests in Japanese-occupied areas. Mr. Kurusu then repeated
                            what he had said two or three times previously about the effect of the
                            Washington Conference treaties upon China which had caused China to
                            flaunt Japan’s rights. He said that in view of the actual situation in
                            the Far East there were points in our proposal of November 26 which the
                            Japanese Government would find it difficult to accept. Mr. Welles asked
                            whether we may expect shortly a reply from the Japanese Government on
                            our proposal. The Ambassador replied in the affirmative, but said that
                            it might take a few days in view of the important questions which it
                            raised for the Japanese Government. Mr. Kurusu expressed the hope that
                            the American Government would exercise cool judgment in its
                            consideration of questions under discussion between the two Governments.
                            Mr. Welles said that we are asking for cool judgment on the part of
                            Japanese statesmen.</p>
                        <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0847"/>
                        <p>Then Mr. Kurusu said that the Japanese felt that we had made real
                            progress in our discussions and that the Japanese Government had been
                            hopeful of being able to work out with us some settlement of the three
                            outstanding points on which our draft of June 21 and the Japanese draft
                            of September 25 had not been reconciled. He asked whether the Secretary
                            would be willing to consider resuming our efforts to reconcile our
                            differences on those three points, in view of all the progress that had
                            been made, instead of approaching the problem from a new angle as we had
                            done in our latest proposal which seemed to the Japanese Government to
                            require a completely fresh start.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles said that our proposal of November 26 represented an effort to
                            restate our complete position, as it has always stood. He said, however,
                            that he would be glad to refer to the Secretary Mr. Kurusu’s
                            suggestion.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu called at their request at the
                            Department. The Ambassador handed to the Secretary a paper which he said
                            was the Japanese Government’s reply to the President’s inquiry in regard
                            to Japanese troops in French Indochina. The paper reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of the statement printed <hi rend="italic"
                            >infra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary read the paper and asked whether the Japanese considered
                            that the Chinese were liable to attack them in Indochina. He said, so
                            Japan has assumed the defensive against China. He said that he had heard
                            that the Chinese are contending that their massing troops in Yunnan was
                            in answer to Japan’s massing troops in Indochina. Mr. Kurusu said that
                            that is all that they have received from their Government in regard to
                            this matter. The Ambassador said that as the Chinese were eager to
                            defend the Burma Road he felt that the possibility of a Chinese attack
                            in Indochina as a means of preventing Japan’s attacking the Burma Road
                            from Indochina could not be excluded.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had understood that Japan had been putting
                            forces into northern Indochina for the purpose of attacking China from
                            there. He said that he had never heard before that Japan’s troop
                            movements into northern Indochina were for the purpose of defense
                            against Chinese attack. The Secretary added that it was the first time
                            that he knew that Japan was on the defensive in Indochina.</p>
                        <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0848"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Japanese are alarmed over increasing naval
                            and military preparations of the ABCD powers in the southwest Pacific
                            area, and that an airplane of one of those countries had recently flown
                            over Formosa. He said that our military men are very alert and
                            enterprising and are known to believe in the principle that offense is
                            the best defense. The Secretary asked whether the Ambassador’s
                            observations applied to defensive measures we are taking against Hitler.
                            The Ambassador replied that he did not say that, but that it was because
                            of Japan’s apprehensions in regard to the situation that they had made
                            their November 20 proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether, if the Chinese are about to attack Japan in
                            Indochina, this would not constitute an additional reason for Japan to
                            withdraw her armed forces from Indochina. The Secretary said that he
                            would be glad to get anything further which it might occur to the
                            Japanese Government to say to us on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Japanese Government was very anxious to
                            reach an agreement with this Government and Mr. Kurusu said that the
                            Japanese Government felt that we ought to be willing to agree to
                            discontinue aid to China as soon as conversations between China and
                            Japan were initiated. The Secretary pointed out that when the Japanese
                            bring that matter up it brings up the matter of the aid Japan is giving
                            to Hitler. He said that he did not see how Japan could demand that we
                            cease giving aid to China while Japan was going on aiding Hitler. Mr.
                            Kurusu asked in what way was Japan aiding Hitler. The Secretary replied
                            that, as he had already made clear to the Japanese Ambassador, Japan was
                            aiding Hitler by keeping large forces of this country and other
                            countries immobilized in the Pacific area. (At this point the Ambassador
                            uttered <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> an expression in Japanese
                            which in the present context means “this isn’t getting us anywhere”.)
                            The Secretary reminded the Ambassador of what the Secretary had said to
                            the Ambassador on this point on November 22 as well as on our
                            unwillingness to supply oil to Japan for the Japanese Navy which would
                            enable Japan to operate against us in the southern Pacific and also on
                            our attitude toward continuing aid to China. The Ambassador said that he
                            recalled that the Secretary had said that he would almost incur the
                            danger of being lynched if he permitted oil to go to Japan for her navy.
                            The Ambassador said that he believed that if the Secretary would explain
                            that giving of oil to Japan had been prompted by the desirability of
                            reaching a peaceful agreement such explanation would be accepted. The
                            Secretary replied that senators and others are not even now desisting
                            from criticizing the Secretary for the course that he had hitherto
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then recapitulated the three points on which he had orally
                            commented to the Japanese Ambassador on November 22, <pb n="783"
                                xml:id="pg_783" facs="0849"/>with reference to the Japanese proposal
                            of November 20, namely one, our difficulty with reference to the
                            Japanese request that we discontinue aid to China, two, our feeling that
                            the presence of large bodies of Japanese troops anywhere in Indochina
                            caused among neighboring countries apprehensions for their security,
                            and, three, public attitude in this country toward supplying Japan with
                            oil for military and naval needs. He asked the Ambassador whether he had
                            not set forth clearly his position on these points to the Ambassador on
                            November 22. The Ambassador agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that this Government blames Japan for its move into
                            Indochina but that if Indochina was controlled by other powers it would
                            be a menace to Japan. The Secretary replied that as the Ambassador was
                            aware we could solve matters without delay if only the Japanese
                            Government would renounce courses of force and aggression. The Secretary
                            added that we were not looking for trouble but that at the same time we
                            were not running away from menaces.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kurusu said that he felt that if we could only come to an agreement
                            on temporary measures we could then proceed with our exploration of
                            fundamental solutions. He said that such a fundamental agreement would
                            necessarily take time and that what was needed now was a temporary
                            expedient. The Secretary replied that the Japanese were keeping the
                            situation confused by a malignant campaign conducted through the
                            officially controlled and inspired press which created an atmosphere not
                            conducive to peace. The Secretary said that we knew the Japanese
                            Government could control the press and that therefore we did not
                            understand what the motives are of the higher officials of the Japanese
                            Government in promoting such a campaign. Mr. Kurusu said that on the
                            American side we were not free from injurious newspaper propaganda. He
                            said that for example there was the case of a newspaper report of the
                            Secretary’s interview with the press which created an unfortunate
                            impression in Japan. The Secretary replied that he had been seeing for
                            months and months that Japanese officials and the Japanese press had
                            been proclaiming slogans of a bellicose character and that while all
                            this was going on he had kept silent. He pointed out that now he was
                            being jumped on by the Japanese if he said a single word in regard to
                            his Government’s principles. Mr. Kurusu then referred to a press report
                            casting aspersions on Kurusu to the effect that he had been sent here to
                            check on the Ambassador, et cetera, et cetera. The Secretary replied
                            that he had heard only good reports in regard to Mr. Kurusu and the
                            Ambassador. At this point the Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu took their leave
                            after making the usual apologies for taking so much of the Secretary’s
                            time when he was busy.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to your inquiry about the intention of the Japanese
                            Government with regard to the reported movements of Japanese troops in
                            French Indo-china. Under instructions from Tokyo I wish to inform you as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>As Chinese troops have recently shown frequent signs of movements along
                            the northern frontier of French Indo-china bordering on China, Japanese
                            troops, with the object of mainly taking precautionary measures, have
                            been reinforced to a certain extent in the northern part of French
                            Indo-china. As a natural sequence of this step, certain movements have
                            been made among the troops stationed in the southern part of the said
                            territory. It seems that an exaggerated report has been made of these
                            movements. It should be added that no measure has been taken on the part
                            of the Japanese Government that may transgress the stipulations of the
                            Protocol of Joint Defense between Japan and France.</p>

                        <p>Almost a century ago the President of the United States addressed to the
                            Emperor of Japan a message extending an offer of friendship of the
                            people of the United States to the people of Japan.<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d418fn71">See letter from President Fillmore to the Japanese

                                6, p. 517.</note> That offer was accepted, and in the long period of
                            unbroken peace and friendship which has followed, our respective
                            nations, through the <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0851"/>virtues of
                            their peoples and the wisdom of their rulers have prospered and have
                            substantially helped humanity.</p>
                        <p>Only in situations of extraordinary importance to our two countries need
                            I address to Your Majesty messages on matters of state. I feel I should
                            now so address you because of the deep and far-reaching emergency which
                            appears to be in formation.</p>
                        <p>Developments are occurring in the Pacific area which threaten to deprive
                            each of our nations and all humanity of the beneficial influence of the
                            long peace between our two countries. Those developments contain tragic
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p>The people of the United States, believing in peace and in the right of
                            nations to live and let live, have eagerly watched the conversations
                            between our two Governments during these past months. We have hoped for
                            a termination of the present conflict between Japan and China. We have
                            hoped that a peace of the Pacific could be consummated in such a way
                            that nationalities of many diverse peoples could exist side by side
                            without fear of invasion; that unbearable burdens of armaments could be
                            lifted for them all; and that all peoples would resume commerce without
                            discrimination against or in favor of any nation.</p>
                        <p>I am certain that it will be clear to Your Majesty, as it is to me, that
                            in seeking these great objectives both Japan and the United States
                            should agree to eliminate any form of military threat. This seemed
                            essential to the attainment of the high objectives.</p>
                        <p>More than a year ago Your Majesty’s Government concluded an agreement
                            with the Vichy Government by which five or six thousand Japanese troops
                            were permitted to enter into Northern French Indo-China for the
                            protection of Japanese troops which were operating against China further
                            north. And this Spring and Summer the Vichy Government permitted further
                            Japanese military forces to enter into Southern French Indo-China for
                            the common defense of French Indo-China. I think I am correct in saying
                            that no attack has been made upon Indo-China, nor that any has been
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>During the past few weeks it has become clear to the world that Japanese
                            military, naval and air forces have been sent to Southern Indo-China in
                            such large numbers as to create a reasonable doubt on the part of other
                            nations that this continuing concentration in Indo-China is not
                            defensive in its character.</p>
                        <p>Because these continuing concentrations in Indo-China have reached such
                            large proportions and because they extend now to the southeast and the
                            southwest corners of that Peninsula, it is only reasonable that the
                            people of the Philippines, of the hundreds of Islands of the East
                            Indies, of Malaya and of Thailand itself are asking themselves whether
                            these forces of Japan are preparing or intending to make attack in one
                            or more of these many directions.</p>
                        <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0852"/>
                        <p>I am sure that Your Majesty will understand that the fear of all these
                            peoples is a legitimate fear in as much as it involves their peace and
                            their national existence. I am sure that Your Majesty will understand
                            why the people of the United States in such large numbers look askance
                            at the establishment of military, naval and air bases manned and
                            equipped so greatly as to constitute armed forces capable of measures of
                            offense.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that a continuance of such a situation is unthinkable.</p>
                        <p>None of the peoples whom I have spoken of above can sit either
                            indefinitely or permanently on a keg of dynamite.</p>
                        <p>There is absolutely no thought on the part of the United States of
                            invading Indo-China if every Japanese soldier or sailor were to be
                            withdrawn therefrom.</p>
                        <p>I think that we can obtain the same assurance from the Governments of the
                            East Indies, the Governments of Malaya and the Government of Thailand. I
                            would even undertake to ask for the same assurance on the part of the
                            Government of China. Thus a withdrawal of the Japanese forces from
                            Indo-China would result in the assurance of peace throughout the whole
                            of the South Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>I address myself to Your Majesty at this moment in the fervent hope that
                            Your Majesty may, as I am doing, give thought in this definite emergency
                            to ways of dispelling the dark clouds. I am confident that both of us,
                            for the sake of the peoples not only of our own great countries but for
                            the sake of humanity in neighboring territories, have a sacred duty to
                            restore traditional amity and prevent further death and destruction in
                            the world.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador asked for an appointment to see the Secretary at

                                7, 4 p.m., Washington time), the Japanese imperial headquarters
                                announced that war began as of “dawn” on that date.</note> but later
                            telephoned and asked that the appointment be postponed to 1:45 as the
                            Ambassador was not quite ready. The Ambassador and Mr. Kurusu arrived at
                            the Department at 2:05 p.m. and were received by the Secretary at
                            2:20.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador stated that he had been instructed to deliver at
                            1:00 p.m. the document which he handed the Secretary, but that he was
                            sorry that he had been delayed owing to the need <pb n="787"
                                xml:id="pg_787" facs="0853"/>of more time to decode the message. The
                            Secretary asked why he had specified one o’clock. The Ambassador replied
                            that he did not know but that that was his instruction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that anyway he was receiving the message at two
                            o’clock.</p>
                        <p>After the Secretary had read two or three pages he asked the Ambassador
                            whether this document was presented under instructions of the Japanese
                            Government. The Ambassador replied that it was. The Secretary as soon as
                            he had finished reading the document turned to the Japanese Ambassador
                            and said, <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I must say that in all my conversations with you (the Japanese

                                    word of untruth. This is borne out absolutely by the record. In
                                    all my fifty years of public service I have never seen a

                                    distortions—infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so
                                    huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on

                        <p>1. The Government of Japan, prompted by a genuine desire to come to an
                            amicable understanding with the Government of the United States in order
                            that the two countries by their joint efforts may secure the peace of
                            the Pacific Area and thereby contribute toward the realization of world
                            peace, has continued negotiations with the utmost sincerity since April
                            last with the Government of the United States regarding the adjustment
                            and advancement of Japanese-American relations and the stabilization of
                            the Pacific Area.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government has the honor to state frankly its views
                            concerning the claims the American Government has persistently
                            maintained as well as the measures the United States and Great Britain
                            have taken toward Japan during these eight months.</p>
                        <p>2. It is the immutable policy of the Japanese Government to insure the
                            stability of East Asia and to promote world peace and <pb n="788"
                                xml:id="pg_788" facs="0854"/>thereby to enable all nations to find
                            each its proper place in the world.</p>
                        <p>Ever since China Affair broke out owing to the failure on the part of
                            China to comprehend Japan’s true intentions, the Japanese Government has
                            striven for the restoration of peace and it has consistently exerted its
                            best efforts to prevent the extention of war-like disturbances. It was
                            also to that end that in September last year Japan concluded the
                            Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy.</p>
                        <p>However, both the United States and Great Britain have resorted to every
                            possible measure to assist the Chungking régime so as to obstruct the
                            establishment of a general peace between Japan and China, interfering
                            with Japan’s constructive endeavours toward the stabilization of East
                            Asia. Exerting pressure on the Netherlands East Indies, or menacing
                            French Indo-China, they have attempted to frustrate Japan’s aspiration
                            to the ideal of common prosperity in cooperation with these regions.
                            Furthermore, when Japan in accordance with its protocol with France took
                            measures of joint defence of French Indo-China, both American and
                            British Governments, wilfully misinterpreting it as a threat to their
                            own possessions, and inducing the Netherlands Government to follow suit,
                            they enforced the assets freezing order, thus severing economic
                            relations with Japan. While manifesting thus an obviously hostile
                            attitude, these Countries have strengthened their military preparations
                            perfecting an encirclement of Japan, and have brought about a situation
                            which endangers the very existence of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, to facilitate a speedy settlement, the Premier of Japan
                            proposed, in August last, to meet the President of the United States for
                            a discussion of important problems between the two countries covering
                            the entire Pacific area. However, the American Government, while
                            accepting in principle the Japanese proposal, insisted that the meeting
                            should take place after an agreement of view had been reached on
                            fundamental and essential questions.</p>
                        <p>3. Subsequently, on September 25th the Japanese Government submitted a
                            proposal based on the formula proposed by the American Government,
                            taking fully into consideration past American claims and also
                            incorporating Japanese views. Repeated discussions proved of no avail in
                            producing readily an agreement of view. The present cabinet, therefore,
                            submitted a revised proposal, moderating still further the Japanese
                            claims regarding the principal points of difficulty in the negotiation
                            and endeavoured strenuously to reach a settlement. But the American
                            Government, adhering steadfastly to its original assertions, failed to
                            display in the slightest degree a spirit of conciliation. The
                            negotiation made no progress.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the Japanese Government, with a view to doing its utmost for
                            averting a crisis in Japanese-American relations, submitted <pb n="789"
                                xml:id="pg_789" facs="0855"/>on November 20th still another proposal
                            in order to arrive at an equitable solution of the more essential and
                            urgent questions which, simplifying its previous proposal, stipulated
                            the following points: <list>

                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>The Japanese Government undertakes to withdraw troops now

                                    equitable peace in the Pacific Area; and it is prepared to
                                    remove the Japanese troops in the southern part of French
                                    Indo-China to the northern part upon the conclusion of the
                                    present agreement.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As regards China, the Japanese Government, while expressing its readiness
                            to accept the offer of the President of the United States to act as
                            “introducer” of peace between Japan and China as was previously
                            suggested, asked for an undertaking on the part of the United States to
                            do nothing prejudicial to the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace when
                            the two parties have commenced direct negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The American Government not only rejected the above-mentioned new
                            proposal, but made known its intention to continue its aid to Chiang
                            Kai-shek; and in spite of its suggestion mentioned above, withdrew the
                            offer of the President to act as so-called “introducer” of peace between
                            Japan and China, pleading that time was not yet ripe for it. Finally on
                            November 26th, in an attitude to impose upon the Japanese Government
                            those principles it has persistently maintained, the American Government
                            made a proposal totally ignoring Japanese claims, which is a source of
                            profound regret to the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>4. From the beginning of the present negotiation the Japanese Government
                            has always maintained an attitude of fairness and moderation, and did
                            its best to reach a settlement, for which it made all possible
                            concessions often in spite of great difficulties. As for the China
                            question which constituted an important subject of the negotiation, the
                            Japanese Government showed a most conciliatory attitude. As for the
                            principle of non-discrimination in international commerce, <pb n="790"
                                xml:id="pg_790" facs="0856"/>advocated by the American Government,
                            the Japanese Government expressed its desire to see the said principle
                            applied throughout the world, and declared that along with the actual
                            practice of this principle in the world, the Japanese Government would
                            endeavour to apply the same in the Pacific Area including China, and
                            made it clear that Japan had no intention of excluding from China
                            economic activities of third powers pursued on an equitable basis.
                            Furthermore, as regards the question of withdrawing troops from French
                            Indo-China, the Japanese Government even volunteered, as mentioned
                            above, to carry out an immediate evacuation of troops from Southern
                            French Indo-China as a measure of easing the situation.</p>
                        <p>It is presumed that the spirit of conciliation exhibited to the utmost
                            degree by the Japanese Government in all these matters is fully
                            appreciated by the American Government.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the American Government, always holding fast to
                            theories in disregard of realities, and refusing to yield an inch on its
                            impractical principles, caused undue delay in the negotiation. It is
                            difficult to understand this attitude of the American Government and the
                            Japanese Government desires to call the attention of the American
                            Government especially to the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. The American Government advocates in the name of world peace those
                            principles favorable to it and urges upon the Japanese Government the
                            acceptance thereof. The peace of the world may be brought about only by
                            discovering a mutually acceptable formula through recognition of the
                            reality of the situation and mutual appreciation of one another’s
                            position. An attitude such as ignores realities and imposes one’s
                            selfish views upon others will scarcely serve the purpose of
                            facilitating the consummation of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Of the various principles put forward by the American Government as a
                            basis of the Japanese-American Agreement, there are some which the
                            Japanese Government is ready to accept in principle, but in view of the
                            world’s actual conditions, it seems only a Utopian ideal on the part of
                            the American Government to attempt to force their immediate
                            adoption.</p>
                        <p>Again, the proposal to conclude a multilateral non-aggression pact
                            between Japan, United States, Great Britain, China, the Soviet Union,
                            the Netherlands and Thailand, which is patterned after the old concept
                            of collective security, is far removed from the realities of East
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. The American proposal contained a stipulation which states—“Both
                            Governments will agree that no agreement, which either has concluded
                            with any third power or powers, shall be interpreted by it in such a way
                            as to conflict with the fundamental purpose of this agreement, the
                            establishment and preservation of peace throughout the Pacific area.” It
                            is presumed that the above provision has been proposed with a view to
                            restrain Japan from fulfilling its obligations under the Tripartite Pact
                            when the United States participates in the War in Europe, and, as such,
                            it cannot be accepted by the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0857"/>
                        <p>The American Government, obsessed with its own views and opinions, may be
                            said to be scheming for the extension of the war. While it seeks, on the
                            one hand, to secure its rear by stabilizing the Pacific Area, it is
                            engaged, on the other hand, in aiding Great Britain and preparing to
                            attack, in the name of self-defense, Germany and Italy, two Powers that
                            are striving to establish a new order in Europe. Such a policy is
                            totally at variance with the many principles upon which the American
                            Government proposes to found the stability of the Pacific Area through
                            peaceful means.</p>
                        <p>3. Whereas the American Government, under the principles it rigidly
                            upholds, objects to settle international issues through military
                            pressure, it is exercising in conjunction with Great Britain and other
                            nations pressure by economic power. Recourse to such pressure as a means
                            of dealing with international relations should be condemned as it is at
                            times more inhumane than military pressure.</p>
                        <p>4. It is impossible not to reach the conclusion that the American
                            Government desires to maintain and strengthen, in coalition with Great
                            Britain and other Powers, its dominant position it has hitherto occupied
                            not only in China but in other areas of East Asia. It is a fact of
                            history that the countries of East Asia for the past hundred years or
                            more have been compelled to observe the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi> under the Anglo-American policy of imperialistic
                            exploitation and to sacrifice themselves to the prosperity of the two
                            nations. The Japanese Government cannot tolerate the perpetuation of
                            such a situation since it directly runs counter to Japan’s fundamental
                            policy to enable all nations to enjoy each its proper place in the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The stipulation proposed by the American Government relative to French
                            Indo-China is a good exemplification of the above-mentioned American
                            policy. Thus the six countries,—Japan, the United States, Great Britain,
                            the Netherlands, China and Thailand,—excepting France, should undertake
                            among themselves to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
                            French Indo-China and equality of treatment in trade and commerce would
                            be tantamount to placing that territory under the joint guarantee of the
                            Governments of those six countries. Apart from the fact that such a
                            proposal totally ignores the position of France, it is unacceptable to
                            the Japanese Government in that such an arrangement cannot but be
                            considered as an extension to French Indo-China of a system similar to
                            the Nine Power Treaty structure which is the chief factor responsible
                            for the present predicament of East Asia.</p>
                        <p>5. All the items demanded of Japan by the American Government regarding
                            China such as wholesale evacuation of troops or unconditional
                            application of the principle of non-discrimination in international
                            commerce ignored the actual conditions of China, and are calculated to
                            destroy Japan’s position as the stabilizing factor of East Asia. The
                            attitude of the American Government in demanding Japan not to support
                            militarily, politically or economically any régime other than the régime
                            at Chungking, disregarding thereby the existence of the Nanking
                            Government, shatters the very basis of the present negotiation. This
                            demand <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0858"/>of the American
                            Government falling, as it does, in line with its above-mentioned refusal
                            to cease from aiding the Chungking regime, demonstrates clearly the
                            intention of the American Government to obstruct the restoration of
                            normal relations between Japan and China and the return of peace to East
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>5. In brief, the American proposal contains certain acceptable items such
                            as those concerning commerce, including the conclusion of a trade
                            agreement, mutual removal of the freezing restrictions, and
                            stabilization of yen and dollar exchange, or the abolition of
                            extraterritorial rights in China. On the other hand, however, the
                            proposal in question ignores Japan’s sacrifices in the four years of the
                            China Affair, menaces the Empire’s existence itself and disparages its
                            honour and prestige. Therefore, viewed in its entirety, the Japanese
                            Government regrets that it cannot accept the proposal as a basis of
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>6. The Japanese Government, in its desire for an early conclusion of the
                            negotiation, proposed simultaneously with the conclusion of the
                            Japanese-American negotiation, agreements to be signed with Great
                            Britain and other interested countries. The proposal was accepted by the
                            American Government. However, since the American Government has made the
                            proposal of November 26th as a result of frequent consultation with
                            Great Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and Chungking, and presumably
                            by catering to the wishes of the Chungking regime in the questions of
                            China, it must be concluded that all these countries are at one with the
                            United States in ignoring Japan’s position.</p>
                        <p>7. Obviously it is the intention of the American Government to conspire
                            with Great Britain and other countries to obstruct Japan’s efforts
                            toward the establishment of peace through the creation of a new order in
                            East Asia, and especially to preserve Anglo-American rights and
                            interests by keeping Japan and China at war. This intention has been
                            revealed clearly during the course of the present negotiation. Thus, the
                            earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American
                            relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through
                            cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the American
                            Government that in view of the attitude of the American Government it
                            cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through
                            further negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Japan has made a treacherous and utterly unprovoked attack upon the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>At the very moment when representatives of the Japanese Government were
                            discussing with representatives of this Government, at the request of
                            the former, principles and courses of peace, the armed forces of Japan
                            were preparing and assembling at various strategic points to launch new
                            attacks and new aggressions upon nations and peoples with which Japan
                            was professedly at peace including the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am now releasing for the information of the American people the
                            statement of principles governing the policies of the Government of the
                            United States and setting out suggestions for a comprehensive peaceful
                            settlement covering the entire Pacific area, which I handed to the
                            Japanese Ambassador on November 26, 1941.</p>
                        <p>I am likewise releasing the text of a Japanese reply thereto which was
                            handed to me by the Japanese Ambassador today. Before the Japanese
                            Ambassador delivered this final statement from his Government the
                            treacherous attack upon the United States had taken place.</p>
                        <p>This Government has stood for all the principles that underlie
                            fair-dealing, peace, law and order, and justice between nations and has
                            steadfastly striven to promote and maintain that state of relations
                            between itself and all other nations.</p>
                        <p>It is now apparent to the whole world that Japan in its recent
                            professions of a desire for peace has been infamously false and
                            fraudulent.</p>

                                States</hi>:</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United
                            States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and
                            air forces of the Empire of Japan.</p>
                        <p>The United States was at peace with that Nation and, at the solicitation
                            of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor
                            looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour
                            after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in Oahu, the Japanese
                            Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the
                            Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While
                            this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing
                            diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed
                            attack.</p>
                        <pb n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0860"/>
                        <p>It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it
                            obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks
                            ago. During the intervening time the Japanese Government has
                            deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and
                            expressions of hope for continued peace.</p>
                        <p>The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to
                            American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been
                            lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the
                            high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against
                            Malaya.</p>
                        <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.</p>
                        <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam.</p>
                        <p>Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.</p>
                        <p>Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island.</p>
                        <p>This morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.</p>
                        <p>Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending
                            throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday speak for
                            themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their
                            opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and
                            safety of our Nation.</p>
                        <p>As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all
                            measures be taken for our defense.</p>
                        <p>Always will we remember the character of the onslaught against us.</p>
                        <p>No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion,
                            the American people in their righteous might will win through to
                            absolute victory.</p>
                        <p>I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I
                            assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will
                            make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our
                            territory, and our interests are in grave danger.</p>
                        <p>With confidence in our armed forces—with the unbounded determination of
                            our people—we will gain the inevitable triumph—so help us God.</p>
                        <p>I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly
                            attack by Japan on Sunday, December seventh, a state of war has existed
                            between the United States and the Japanese Empire.</p>
