                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the formulation of policies, including the events which contributed to
                    that process, and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the
                    policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, <hi
                        rend="italic">et seq</hi>).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>
                <p>The editors of this volume, which was compiled in 1986, are convinced that it
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing with one exception which is explained later in this Preface. Although
                    this volume records policies and events of more than 30 years ago, the statute
                    of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line
                    in the publication of the series.</p>

                        Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series. This subseries documents the most important
                    issues in the foreign policy of the final three years (1958–1960) of the
                    administration of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>.
                    Within the 1958–1960 subseries, six volumes and four microfiche supplements
                    present the record of U.S. policy toward East Asia. This volume presents
                    documentation on U.S. policy toward Japan and Korea. <ref

                    and the related question of the rebellion in Tibet. <ref target="frus1958-60v01"
                        >Volume I</ref> is devoted exclusively to Vietnam. <ref

                    regional policy for East Asia as well as extensive material on policy toward
                    Cambodia and Laos. <ref target="frus1958-60v15">Volume XV</ref> includes
                    material on the rest of Southeast Asia and <ref target="frus1958-60v17">Volume
                        XVII</ref> documents U.S. policy toward Indonesia. Additional documents are
                    presented in a microfiche supplement to this volume (which includes documents
                    from <ref target="frus1958-60v17">Volume XVII</ref>) and in microfiche
                    supplements to <ref target="frus1958-60v15">Volumes XV</ref>, <ref

                        >XIX</ref>. Other volumes containing material related to Japan and Korea are
                        <ref target="frus1958-60v03">Volume III</ref>, National Security Policy, and

                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of access to
                    documentation this volume meets the standards and mandates of this statute.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations
                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The editors have had complete access to all the retired records and papers in the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the decentralized
                    (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the
                    files of the Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of
                    international conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with
                    foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of
                    conversations between the President and Secretary of State and foreign
                    officials; and the files of overseas <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"
                    />diplomatic posts. Any failure to include a complete Department of State record
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series cannot be attributed to
                    constraints or limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access
                    to Department records, information security regulations and practices
                    notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume fully researched the papers of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of this documentation has been made available for use
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of
                    these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians have also enjoyed steadily broadened access to
                    records of the Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and his major assistants.</p>
                <p>As noted above, the statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the editors have
                    full and complete access to all records pertinent to foreign policy decisions
                    and actions. The research, compiling, and editing of this volume, however, were
                    completed in 1986, without access to Central Intelligence Agency records. Since
                    early 1991 the Central Intelligence Agency, in cooperation with the Department
                    of State, has provided expanded access to Department historians to high-level
                    intelligence documents from those records still in the custody of that Agency.
                    Submitting the documents for declassification review would have necessitated
                    considerable delay in the publication of the volume, however, and the Department
                    chose not to postpone publication. Some of the documents have been submitted for
                    declassification review and will be published in the appropriate 1961–1963
                    volume. Department of State historians’ expanded access was arranged by the
                    History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence
                    Agency.</p>
                <p>Apart from this exception, this volume was prepared in a manner consonant with
                    the standards and mandates of the statute. The List of Sources, pages
                    XIII–XVIII, identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume.</p>

                        XVIII</ref>, the editors gave primary consideration to the formulation of
                    policy within the U.S. Government and the most significant aspects of U.S.
                    relations with foreign governments. Policy recommendations to President
                        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName><pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"
                        facs="0010"/>and his decisions with respect to government policies and
                    actions are documented as fully as possible. Discussions and actions of the
                    National Security Council and Presidential discussions of policy with
                    Cabinet-level officers are included.</p>
                <p>During the years 1958–1960, the Department of State played a leading role in the
                    formulation of U.S. foreign policy. Secretaries of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Christian A. Herter</persName> drew upon the Department’s
                    expertise in advising the President and taking leading roles in the
                    deliberations of the National Security Council. The editors sought to include
                    material documenting their roles and, where relevant, the interaction of the
                    Department of State with the Department of Defense or other government agencies.
                    Reportage and intelligence estimates that were seen by high-level policymakers
                    and may have influenced their policy decisions have also been included.</p>
                <p>The editors sought to document as comprehensively as possible the implementation
                    of U.S. policies toward Japan and Korea through exchanges between high-level
                    U.S. officials and foreign government and U.N. officials on key issues that were
                    of primary concern to the policymakers at the time. The editors made no attempt
                    to document the whole range of day-to-day relationships, issues, and contacts
                    between the United States and Japan and the Republic of Korea.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>source text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in chronological order. The amount of material omitted
                    because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been
                    delineated. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so
                    identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other firsthand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    Title IV of the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act, amended on October
                    28, 1991, reviews records, advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors
                    the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and assists with any
                    access and/or clearance problems that arise. Time constraints prevent the
                    Advisory Committee from reviewing all volumes in the series.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Declassification Review</hi></p>
                <p>The declassification review of this volume was conducted in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Order 12356 and Title IV of the State Department’s Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956, 22 USC 4351, <hi rend="italic">et seq.,</hi> concerning
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Department of State has
                    determined that approximately 10 percent of the original documentary text
                    selected by Department of State historians and proposed for <pb n="VIII"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>publication in the Japan compilation requires
                    continued classification in the interests of national security. The most
                    important portion of the documents withheld from publication as a result of the
                    declassification review were those relating to the negotiation of the United
                    States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security of 1960 and its related
                    arrangements. Except for these documents, exempted under procedures established
                    by Title IV, the published record regarding policy toward Japan meets generally
                    accepted scholarly standards of accuracy and completeness.</p>
                <p>Although the complete official record of policy toward Japan cannot be published
                    here, the editors regard the remaining record as important to a public
                    understanding of U.S. foreign policy. Title IV establishes a 30-year publication
                    line for the series, and thus the foreign affairs record for the administration
                    of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> must now be
                    published. At such time as the remainder of the original manuscript can be
                    declassified, consistent with national security criteria, the Department will
                    take steps to disclose and publish it in an appropriate format.</p>
                <p>The Department of State’s Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation has been apprised of the Department’s decisions regarding
                    declassification review of this volume. The Committee concluded that a full
                    explication of the United States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security
                    of 1960 and its related arrangements was integral and essential to a
                    comprehensive and accurate record of U.S.-Japan relations. In light of the
                    Department’s decision not to publish the complete record at this time, the
                    Advisory Committee has approved the inclusion of this disclaimer in the
                    volume.</p>
                <p>The declassification review of the Korea compilation resulted in withholding from
                    publication 1.2 percent of the selected documents. The withheld documentation
                    relating to Korea consisted largely of material pertaining to the introduction
                    of certain modern weapons into Korea and the related question of South Korean
                    military force levels, as well as some intelligence analyses and material
                    concerning intelligence activities, sources, and methods.</p>
                <p>Those documents omitted in their entirety from this volume are identified (by
                    description, date, and archival provenance) in the text where they would have
                    been printed. Excisions from printed texts are identified by suitable editorial
                    devices.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification: <list>

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                            <item><p>As preface I must again stress my conviction that Japan’s
                                    foreign policy and international orientation will over long term
                                    be governed very largely by economic facts of life and notably
                                    fact that Japan must trade or die. If US and other free world
                                    countries do not allow Japan a fair and reasonable share of
                                    their markets so she can earn her living, Japan will inevitably
                                    be forced to turn elsewhere, and at same time great and lasting
                                    bitterness toward US will be engendered here. If Japan is forced
                                    into some form of economic accommodation with Communist Bloc,
                                    Communists will of course exact political price. Thus if we and
                                    other free world countries start down trade restrictionist path
                                    with respect to Japanese products, all other basic problems of
                                    US-Japan relations will, as inevitable consequence, become quite
                                    unmanageable over period of time.</p>
                                <p>On other hand, if we handle our trade and economic relationships
                                    with Japan properly and at same time recognize that it is most
                                    urgent that we make some fundamental adjustments which go beyond
                                    our present treaty rights, I think there is a good prospect of
                                    putting our overall relations with Japan on reasonably firm and
                                    dependable basis. My suggestions and recommendations for

                                prospect that our bargaining position may decrease as Japan regains
                                her strength. For example, as time passes without necessary
                                adjustment in security treaty to bring it into keeping with
                                realities of present situation, risk may increase that Japan would
                                come to believe its interests best served by termination of treaty
                                without any replacement, feeling strong enough to stand alone like
                                Sweden. With above considerations in mind, and since we may be faced
                                with talks on treaty revision this year, we have been working for
                                some time on possible draft treaty for <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss>’s consideration and will pouch it to you shortly.

                                        mutual treaty to replace present one-sided arrangement.) For

                                        might be limited to Western Pacific (i.e., Japan and Article

                            initiate at least private discussions even before elections.</p>
                        <p>Yet another major subject we should be considering most carefully at same
                            time we are conducting reappraisal of: (a) our policy and administration
                            in Ryukyus; (b) revision of security treaty; and (c) compensation for
                            Bonin islanders, is Asian economic development. It is in our interest to
                            encourage participation by Japan in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            economic development because it will have two fold beneficial effect of
                            furthering US policies in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and in
                            Japan. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Govt more than any in

                            of Japanese foreign policy. Serious effort on our part to facilitate
                            Japanese participation in Asian economic development will <pb n="7"

                            and, in longer run, economic returns to both <gloss target="#t_SEA1"
                                >SEA</gloss> countries and to Japan. Furthermore, it is in US
                            interest that Japan rather than Communist China or Soviets exercise
                            greater economic influence in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.
                            Increasing economic activity of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> makes this
                            latter point of increasing importance.</p>
                        <p>We fully appreciate sensitivities about Japan in many Asian countries
                            leading to concern that it may be hazardous for US to associate itself
                            too closely with Japan in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> economic
                            development. Nevertheless, we are convinced that patient and discreet
                            efforts on part of US political, economic, and <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> officers in all countries concerned to foster closer
                                Japanese-<gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> economic relations
                            would further our objectives in both areas and in Asia as a whole.
                            Developments such as recent conclusion of Indonesian reparations
                            agreement, India–Japan loan agreement, Indonesian request for Japanese
                            shipping, and success of third-country training and technical assistance
                            (which might well be expanded along lines of European Productivity
                            Agency), suggest political atmosphere is gradually changing for better
                            and that it is possible for us to take advantage of this trend.</p>
                        <p>Japan has assumed heavy reparations burdens which will probably be
                            increased soon by agreement with Vietnam. These out-payments represent
                            real economic sacrifice by Japan and it is greatly in our interest that
                            indirect return from them be maximized. Although Embassy of course
                            cannot judge usefulness of reparations program to <gloss
                                target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> thus far, it is our strong belief that
                            every appropriate effort should be made to assure that our own aid
                            programs and Japanese reparations projects be geared to complement each
                            other in economic development countries concerned. It should be evident
                            to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries to whom Japan is paying
                            reparations that Japan’s ability to continue to discharge heavy
                            reparations burden it has assumed is dependent on high level of trade,
                            since many items sent as reparations payments involve raw materials,
                            much of which Japan has had to pay for with dollars and hard currencies
                            obtained through her trade. Therefore it is in these countries’
                            interests to cooperate with Japan in trade field so Japan can continue
                            to have capability of paying reparations.</p>

                            present Security Treaty. I believe it is virtually certain that the
                            question of revision of the existing Security Treaty will be raised with
                            us by the Japanese during the present year. Therefore, it is essential
                            that we think through this matter so that we will be in a position to
                            discuss it in a considered fashion when it comes up.</p>
                        <p>In formulating the enclosed draft, we had in mind the view which you

                            Security Treaty, our objective should be a truly mutual security treaty
                            rather than simply trying to tinker with the existing instrument. We
                            also had in mind the fact that the new treaty should follow the same
                            basic pattern as the other treaties which the United States has
                            negotiated in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, of which you were
                            the principal architect.</p>
                        <p>The crux of the matter will probably be the definition of the treaty
                            area. In the past, some of our people have suggested that, for such a
                            treaty to be really mutual, Japan would have to agree to come to the aid
                            of the United States if the continental United States or its territories
                            elsewhere in the Pacific were attacked. Given the present Japanese
                            interpretation of Japan’s Constitution and the political facts of life
                            in this country, any such condition would prevent the conclusion of a
                            mutual security treaty. If we are to have Japan as a partner and thus be
                            able to continue to use certain of her military and logistical
                            facilities which are very important to us, it is <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> essential for Japan to be committed to come to our aid
                            except within a fairly limited area. This is the area where it is very
                            important for us to have Japan committed to act in the event that either
                            we or the Japanese are attacked. This is the premise of the <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>proposed language in Article VI of the
                            attached draft,<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4">The draft, not printed,
                                defined the treaty area as “all territory under the administrative
                                control of Japan and the island territories in the Western Pacific
                                which are referred to in Article III of the Treaty of Peace with
                                Japan and which are under the administrative control of the United
                                States of America.”</note> and I believe it is consistent with the
                            Japanese interpretation of their Constitution and with our basic
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>In the enclosed draft, in a parallel column to each Article of the draft
                            treaty, we have made notes which explain briefly and in general terms
                            the origin of the language suggested. While there is perhaps more which
                            could be said in describing each article, the text of the draft treaty
                            speaks pretty well for itself and sets out our considered view as to
                            what kind of a treaty would correspond to the practical political
                            realities of the situation in Japan and at the same time secure for us
                            the minimum essential commitments and facilities which are important to
                            us. The new arrangements would not be as advantageous to us as the
                            present ones. However, if we are not prepared to move forward when the
                            time comes with constructive proposals which are based on the principles
                            of equality and mutuality, and which will thus meet the political
                            realities of the situation here, we will progressively run the risk that
                            Japan will come to believe that its best interests are served by
                            terminating the existing Treaty with no replacement. And, if Japan
                            should reach that most unfortunate conclusion, we would have no way to
                            prevent her from simply announcing the termination of the present
                            one-sided treaty by unilateral declaration.</p>
                        <p>As I also pointed out in my telegram, the Administrative Agreement would
                            also have to be re-negotiated. The present one (which as a result of the
                            vastly different circumstances obtaining in 1951 is a very one-sided one
                            in our favor) came under a good deal of attack in Japan because it was
                            not ratified by the Diet, and we would have to bear in mind that a new
                            agreement of this kind would probably have to go before that body. We
                            know that the Japanese have been scrutinizing very carefully our
                            agreements with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries for
                            military facilities, and I believe they will have them very much in mind
                            and will not expect us to be more demanding with respect to Japan than
                            we are with our European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. I
                            might mention that we have reason to believe the Japanese will, in
                            particular, concentrate particular attention on revision of Articles II,
                            III, IV, V, XIV, XXIV, and XXV of the Administrative Agreement.</p>
                        <p>I hope very much you will have an opportunity to consider this whole
                            question before your trip to Manila and Taipei and that I will be able
                            to get at least your preliminary reaction when I see you in Taipei at

                        <p>The basic determination to be made with respect to a revision of the
                            Japanese Security Treaty is whether such a revision is timely.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> does not
                            discuss this point, save to note that the question of revision would be
                            raised by the Japanese some time this year. The same question was raised
                            by the Japanese during the visit of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu in 1955
                            and also during the visit of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> in 1957.</p>
                        <p>In 1955 you took the position that replacement of the existing Security
                            Treaty by another was premature. While the United States had always
                            hoped that the Security Treaty could be translated into a different form
                            of treaty when Japan had developed the capacity to defend itself, the
                            time for that had not yet come. Japan’s political situation was very <pb
                                n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0041"/>confused, and unfriendly elements
                            in the Diet could block the Government’s efforts to build up its defense
                            system. You emphasized your view that a new type of treaty should
                            develop from the conditions contemplated by the existing treaty, namely,
                            when Japan makes an adequate contribution to its own defense, when a
                            healthy spirit of partnership with the United States has been created
                            and when anti-Communist elements are strong enough to ensure passage of
                            their programs and an attitude of cooperation with the United States
                            (Memorandum of conversation of meeting with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu
                            on defense matters on August 30, 1955).<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">For

                        <p>In 1957 in discussing this matter with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, you agreed to minor
                            clarifications dealing principally with the relationship of the Security
                            Treaty and the United Nations Charter. In addition, the
                            Japanese-American Committee on Security was established to provide a
                            greater degree of mutuality in connection with the Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p>At the same time you took the position that replacement of the Security
                            Treaty by another type of treaty or any detailed revision would have to
                            be submitted to the Senate. You felt that the ensuing debate would not
                            be helpful to Japanese-American relations and that outcome would be
                            doubtful. You made plain your view that the basic issue was whether the
                            Japanese Government desired to continue its close and intimate
                            relationship with the United States. If the Japanese desired to ease the
                            United States out of Japan, the United States could consider alternative
                            arrangements in the Far East. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> assured you that he had no desire to change the
                            existing close relationship with the United States.</p>
                        <p>There is a serious question as to whether it can be said that the
                            Japanese have satisfied the conditions precedent to a revised Security
                            Treaty as laid down by you on these earlier occasions. While, as
                            indicated in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>’s letter, the Japanese desire a more “mutual”
                            security treaty, their willingness to undertake the obligations of a
                            mutual security partnership with the United States continues to be
                            subject to doubt at this time.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there is a restiveness in Japan with respect to the
                            alleged “one-sided relationship” resulting from the Security Treaty.
                            Although the form of the Treaty continues unaltered, its substance is
                            already badly eroded and it is questionable whether the United States
                            could at this time exercise the “rights” provided for therein.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not it is now time to undertake a full-scale revision of the
                            Security Treaty in an attempt to obtain a true mutual security treaty,
                            or a treaty having the potentialities of becoming a mutual security <pb
                                n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0042"/>treaty, could be determined by
                            consultation between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to ascertain whether in fact there exists already
                            sufficient mutuality of objectives on both sides to support such a
                            treaty. To enable Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> to discuss the matter we should provide him
                            with a list of our long-term objectives in a mutual security
                            relationship with Japan. The present political situation in Japan is
                            such that the commitments which the Japanese would be willing to
                            undertake in a mutual security treaty negotiated at this time are very
                            limited. We must therefore be very careful to avoid restrictive wording
                            in a new treaty which would greatly limit its usefulness in the future
                            when we hope the Japanese will be willing to enter into a more
                            meaningful mutual security relationship. If we bear in mind our
                            long-term objectives in Japan we can perhaps reach agreement with the
                            Japanese on an “expendable” treaty which would accommodate these
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> will
                            provide information as to Japanese objectives and attitudes which will
                            materially affect our posture. It is conceivable that from the result of
                            these discussions we might conclude that the time for a full-dress
                            revision has not come and that a lesser revision is in order. On the
                            other hand, genuine treaty revision may be indicated. Only after
                            realistic goals are determined in this manner should we proceed to the
                            formulation of treaty previsions giving effect to these
                            determinations.</p>
                        <p>When we reach the point of treaty drafting we could prepare a number of
                            alternative treaty provisions, attacking these problems from various
                            points of view. It is only after this work has been done that we shall
                            be prepared to discuss treaty provisions with the Japanese. We should
                            not, therefore, initiate negotiations with a draft of the type suggested
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>, which
                            provides no alternatives.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the draft mutual security treaty submitted by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> in his letter to
                            you of February 18, 1958, I have the following comments.</p>
                        <p>Article VI<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">See <ref target="#d4fn4">footnote 4,
                                    Document 4</ref>.</note> of his draft would limit the treaty
                            area to present-day Japan plus the Ryukyus and Bonins and the islands
                            the Japanese hope to get back from the Soviet Union. I think, instead,
                            consideration should be given to having a new or revised security treaty
                            open-ended, in the sense that by mutual agreement the parties could
                            designate additional areas protected from aggression under the treaty
                            and also in the sense that other nations in the general area could
                            accede to the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Another factor to be considered is whether the revised security treaty
                            can be so drafted as to permit the Japanese to assume additional <pb
                                n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0043"/>military obligations as
                            amendments to the Japanese constitution are developed. This could be
                            done, for example, by language patterned after the <gloss

                            include in the letter a list of some of the long-term objectives which
                            we hope to achieve with the Japanese (Tab B). In addition, the letter
                            would authorize him to consult with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> about long-term security
                            objectives of a mutual character, to provide the basis for consideration
                            of whether and/or what kind of revisions in our security relations with
                            Japan are desirable at this time.</p>

                        <p>Attached is a study<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">Not printed; see
                                Supplement.</note> which reappraises United States policies toward
                            Japan and makes certain recommendations designed to improve United
                            States-Japanese relations. The study points to the need to modify our
                            policies further to take account of Japan’s resumption of major power
                            status.</p>
                        <p>Entering upon the post-treaty period, Japan recognized its dependence
                            upon the United States in many spheres and in general was prepared to
                            follow the lead of the United States in world affairs and to cooperate
                            with the United States in defense and other matters. Alignment with the
                            United States ensured the defense of Japan, greatly assisted its
                            economic revival and was primarily responsible for the initiative
                            leading to Japan’s return to a leading position in world affairs. At
                            this earlier stage, United States-Japanese relations entailed little
                            conflict of interest or sacrifice of self-interest on either side.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, we have entered a new era in our relations with Japan
                            where the major issues existing between the two countries involve <pb
                                n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0045"/>some conflict of interest with
                            regard to territories, trade and the military posture of Japan. It
                            appears essential to the continued alignment that there be a mutuality
                            of interest and confidence which will enable each country to make
                            difficult choices where some sacrifice of self-interest is required.</p>
                        <p>The study points to the necessity to accommodate Japan’s essential
                            trading patterns as the cornerstone of a full and continuing close
                            cooperation. Cooperative long-term United States-Japanese relations will
                            depend primarily upon the availability to Japan of raw materials and
                            export markets in the United States and other free world nations which
                            will enable Japan to maintain a viable economy.</p>
                        <p>In considering the various issues which tend to alienate Japan from the
                            United States, the study arrives at the following recommendations
                            regarding measures which the United States can take to remove or ease
                            those issues (United States policies in the Ryukyus and Japan’s

                        <p>For some time the Secretary of State and I have been much concerned about
                            our failure to make with the Japanese an acceptable and mutually
                            agreeable arrangement for the Okinawa Base.<note n="1" xml:id="d7fn1">
                                <p>The Secretary brought up the Ryukyus in his conversation with the
                                    President on April 1:</p>
                                <p>“I referred to relations with Japan and the desirability of some
                                    adjustment of our position there which would be sufficiently
                                    timely so that we and our Japanese friends could get credit for
                                    it. I spoke of the situation in Okinawa and the difficulty we
                                    had there, particularly with the Military High Commissioner who
                                    operated on a ‘be tough’ basis. I said I thought we should
                                    explore the possibilities of an enclave, of which we would have
                                    permanent or semi-permanent possession, with the administration
                                    of the rest of the island turned back to the Japanese. The
                                    President thought this idea well worth exploring.” (Memorandum
                                    of conversation with the President by
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName>, April 1; <hi rend="italic"
                                        >ibid</hi>., Dulles Papers, Meetings with the

                        <p>The problem is rather simply stated. We will obviously have the need for
                            the Base for some years. At the same time the natives on Okinawa are
                            growing in number and are very anxious to repossess the land that they
                            once owned.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of legal or treaty arrangements, this conflict creates
                            problems not only with our relationships with the people of Okinawa and
                            Japan but could, if they become acute, be used for ammunition in the
                            Communist propaganda attacks upon us. The situation could become
                            unpleasant. While I do not expect the matter to assume the importance of
                            the Cyprus difficulty with Britain, nor of the Algerian with France,
                            still there could easily develop a situation that would create much
                            embarrassment for us.</p>
                        <p>We feel certain that in the cases of Cyprus and Algiers the local
                            populations would have readily accepted some five to six years ago
                            privileges and rights that the respective mother countries would now
                            gladly accord them. But the undercover struggles in these regions have
                            for their purpose the expulsion of foreign troops from the area and so
                            aroused emotions, misunderstandings and hatreds that nothing less than
                            complete independence will seemingly satisfy the bulk of these
                            populations.</p>
                        <p>The lesson is that we should be forehanded with offers that the Okinawans
                            will clearly recognize as generous and understanding and which will have
                            the effect at least for some years of forestalling trouble.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State informs me that he and the Defense Department are
                            working actively on the problem. I personally hope that there will be an
                            offer made of some division of territory so that there may be
                            established an American enclave of minimum size to meet our needs.</p>
                        <p>I would think that such a political agreement could be established
                            together with reasonable financial remuneration. We might make of all
                            these peoples firm allies rather than latent enemies.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In a conversation with Minister Shimoda of the Japanese Embassy at
                            luncheon on Wednesday, April 9, I asked him what he considered to be the
                            most important problem in United States-Japanese relations. His
                            immediate response was the continued administration by the United States
                            over the Ryukyus and the Bonin Islands.</p>
                        <p>In response to my query as to why this is such an important problem,
                            Minister Shimoda stated that the Japanese consider that the Ryukyus and
                            Bonins were a part of Japan proper before World War II. He added that
                            Japan gave up Formosa, Korea and Manchuria. The Japanese people
                            understand this, since these territories had been taken by conquest. The
                            situation is different, however, for the Ryukyus and Bonins. I quickly
                            responded that the same applies to the Kuriles, to which Minister
                            Shimoda readily agreed.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"/>
                        <p>I then asked Minister Shimoda what the Japanese thought should be done in
                            relation to the Ryukyu–Bonin problem. He explained that there are two
                            schools of thought: The first would call for the immediate reversion of
                            the administrative rights in the Ryukyus and Bonins to Japan. The second
                            advocates a gradual movement, including such things now as the adoption
                            of Japanese textbooks in the Ryukyus, Japanese registry of births and
                            deaths, to be followed by additional measures so that eventually
                            administrative rights would have been turned over to Japan on a de facto
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>I immediately explained that the proposal of the first school of thought
                            would have the distinct disadvantage of inviting the Japanese to whittle
                            away at the freedom of use by the United States of the military bases in
                            the Ryukyus. Such whittling away would be detrimental not only to the
                            United States but also to the defense posture which is so important to
                            Japan. He explained that the Japanese people would understand that to
                            obtain the return of the territory they would have to pay a price for
                            it, and the price they would have to pay would be completely unfettered
                            utilization by the Americans of the bases in the Islands.</p>

                        <p>I then pointed out that under such circumstances the Socialists and the
                            Communists would exert continued pressure against unlimited use of the
                            bases by United States forces, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. He responded that the answer to
                            this one would be obvious and would put the Government of Japan in a
                            much more tenable position than now. They could respond, and in his
                            judgment it would stick with the Japanese people, that the United States
                            had returned the territory belonging to Japan, whereas the Communists
                            had not acted in this good faith in relation to the Kuriles, the
                            Habomais and Shikotan. He felt that being in this position would be very
                            beneficial to the Government of Japan on the territorial question.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of this topic concluded with Minister Shimoda’s prognosis
                            that in his judgment the Government of Japan would request the immediate
                            return of the administrative rights to the Ryukyus and Bonins shortly
                            after the general election which is now expected to be held around May
                            18, 1958.</p>

                                    needs most at this time is that we should exercise our

                                    reasonably contented. This would result in substantial reduction

                        <p>I told the President that further examination into the Okinawa situation
                            had led us to conclude that the moment was not opportune actually to
                            propose a return to the Japanese Government of administrative control in
                            Okinawa. Our military dispositions were at present scattered all around
                            the island in a way which was incompatible with our limiting our
                            jurisdiction to one or two enclaves. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> concurred in the view that it would not be
                            wise to move in this matter at the present time.</p>
                        <p>I said to the President that I felt that the military people should start
                            on a program which might take three to five years to rearrange their
                            affairs on Okinawa so as to facilitate subsequently a return to the
                            Japanese of most of the administrative responsibilities over the
                            Okinawan people. <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0052"/>I recalled in
                            this connection that the Nash report<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">Not

                            Pacific of some facilities now on Okinawa. The President said he thought
                            this was a sound approach. He said he did not want to take it up in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting but that I should
                            explain this situation to <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                                >McElroy</persName> and say that the President approved some such
                            program and felt that unless we got in a position to do this we would
                            have on our hands in a few years a Cyprus situation that would make our
                            position there untenable or at least far from secure.</p>

                            able to read it and discuss it with him prior to your departure for the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting.<note n="2"

                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Council Meeting at
                                Copenhagen May 7–9.</note> I firmly believe, for reasons set forth
                            in the enclosure, that following the formation of a new Japanese
                            government (probably in June) we must be in a position to take the
                            initiative in letting <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> know
                            that we are prepared to discuss treaty revision. I am convinced that
                            such action holds the greatest hope for us to establish an identity of
                            fundamental national interests with Japan in the vital field of security
                            and thus to secure Japan’s long term alignment with us. I am equally
                            convinced that if we simply try indefinitely to temporize or stall on
                            the issue of <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0053"/>treaty revision,
                            such action can only lead to a serious deterioration in our relations
                            with Japan and will also encourage those elements in Japan which seek to
                            shift Japan’s orientation away from the United States. As things now
                            stand, the conservative party in Japan still has support for its policy
                            of alignment with the United States despite the basic and growing desire
                            of all Japanese for a revision of the Security Treaty. Our willingness
                            to effect treaty revision will strengthen the position of those who
                            believe in Japan’s long-term security alignment with the United States
                            and will deny to neutralist and leftist elements a powerful argument for
                            a disengagement policy on the part of Japan.</p>
                        <p>I think it is tremendously important for us to have the initiative in
                            this matter. I feel that if we have the initiative, our prospect of
                            obtaining what we can reasonably expect in a mutual security arrangement
                            is good; whereas if we lose the initiative and the pressure builds up,
                            we may, over a period of the next several years, lose what we have
                            now.</p>
                        <p>After you have read the enclosure, I would be very grateful for your
                            reaction. It was wonderful seeing and talking with you on the plane from
                            Manila to Taipei, and I only wish there were some prospect of your
                            coming out to Japan some time before next year.</p>

                            <p>In your letter you ask for my views on the Secretary’s comments
                                before possible discussion with the President and Defense. At the
                                out-set, <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0054"/>let me say that I
                                agree completely with the Secretary that the essential objective of
                                treaty revision is to develop and expand our close relations with
                                Japan so as to create a balance of power as against the Soviet Union
                                and Communist China. A balance of power involves, of course, not
                                only military aspects but also very important economic and
                                industrial, political, and psychological aspects. The military and
                                other material resources available to balance the Sino-Soviet bloc
                                will obviously not necessarily be increased by a new treaty. Only
                                the steady and continued growth of Japan’s economic and military
                                capabilities, coupled with a desire in her own interest to do more
                                in the field of defense, will accomplish such an increase in the
                                military resources available to balance the threat from the
                                mainland. On the other hand, our basic policy objective with respect
                                to Japan, as I understand it, is the same as our objective with
                                respect to Germany, namely, the firm alignment of Japan (with its
                                vigor and industrial capacity) with the United States and the free
                                world. A truly mutual security treaty which aligns Japan with the
                                United States will, in my judgment, have a real impact on the
                                balance of power, since I believe it will over a period of time
                                result in greater Japanese defense efforts. But also in Asia it will
                                have an important political and psychological sense by wiping out
                                latent doubts over where Japan’s basic loyalties lie, which in turn
                                will affect the attitude and alignment of other free Asian

                            <p>What are the specific objectives of treaty revision? Certain specific
                                “long-term security objectives” are mentioned in the paper attached
                                to the memo you sent the Secretary.<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5"><ref
                                        target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note> While such objectives
                                would be useful for us to have, they will have to be sought, as the
                                Secretary commented, in evolution rather than in terms of what is
                                written into the text of a revised security treaty. The draft treaty
                                which I suggested had in mind the long-term security objectives of
                                American policy, and particularly the long-term alignment of Japan
                                within the framework of a reasonably durable, dependable, and
                                realistic arrangement. But at the same time it took into account the
                                political and psychological realities which we now face in Japan.
                                While Japan is now in practice aligned with the United States, it is
                                not yet a dependable alignment <hi rend="italic">because of the
                                    feeling of many Japanese that the alignment was forced on them
                                    by us in a one-sided manner for our own purposes rather than for
                                    mutual benefit</hi>. Therefore, a fundamental objective of
                                treaty revision would be to define this alignment in a form which
                                will not have attached to it the stigmas and disadvantages now
                                associated in Japan with the present Security Treaty in order to
                                give the alignment durability and dependability.</p>

                            <p>It can be argued that at present Japan is essentially uncommitted to
                                the West because it has reservations regarding certain aspects of
                                some of our policies. It is true that Japanese policy does not on
                                all issues, including some of great importance, coincide with our
                                own; but, neither does British policy on Communist China; nor does
                                Norwegian and Danish policy on the stationing of non-national <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces on their territory; etc.
                                Such differences do not destroy our basic ties with these countries,
                                and similar differences with Japan need not vitiate its basic
                                alignment with the United States. If treaty revision requires
                                unreserved acceptance and approval of all aspects of all major U.S.
                                policies, then I am confident that Japan will not pay this price,
                                any more than would Britain, France, or other of our allies. <hi
                                    rend="italic">However, if we are seeking a basic alignment with
                                    Japan which establishes an identity of fundamental national
                                    interests in the vital field of security, and a framework for
                                    adjusting differences in security matters, early treaty revision
                                    is not only feasible and meaningful but absolutely
                                    essential</hi>.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The need to consolidate our present alignment with
                                    Japan in a treaty agreement is an urgent one</hi>.</p>
                            <p>There are unquestionably elements in Japan which suggest a
                                disengagement from close ties with the United State and toward
                                neutrality or non-involvement as to security commitments. The
                                motivations of such elements are to some extent based on the
                                neutralism and pacifism which is the stated objective of the
                                Socialist Party (and of course the Communist Party) and which strike
                                a responsive chord in the emotional reflexes of much of Japanese
                                opinion, which still feels that “militarism” brought a great
                                disaster to Japan. As the memories of the war, defeat, and
                                occupation recede, however, the acceptability of the Japanese
                                defense effort is gaining momentum and the underlying trends in this
                                general field are favorable to our own interests.</p>
                            <p>However, quite aside from the stated policies of the Socialists,
                                neutralists, and Communists toward disengagement from close
                                relations with the United States, there is a universal desire among
                                the Japanese to liberate themselves from those terms of the security
                                relationship with the United States which they consider as being
                                “genuinely unequal”. This is not an “alleged” inequality, to quote
                                the phrase in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s memorandum to the
                                    Secretary.<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn6">See <ref target="#d5"

                                actual inequality. This has nothing to do with the size of the
                                respective military forces of the two countries. A U.S. military
                                view is that the Japanese can have “equal” treaty status when they
                                have “equal” military forces. This can never happen because of the
                                disparity in the strength and resources of Japan and the United
                                States.</p>

                            <p>There is another aspect of the problem which I would like to touch
                                upon. It is logical that we should want to use military facilities
                                in Japan to “contribute to the maintenance of international peace
                                and security in the Far East”. Our bases in Japan must in practice
                                be linked with our base structure elsewhere in Asia. This Japan
                                recognizes, but it is unwilling to grant us <hi rend="italic">in
                                    advance</hi> the unilateral right to use them as we please in
                                hostilities in which we may be engaged but in which Japan is not.
                                The Japanese are no different in this respect from our other allies.
                                They cannot and will not accept, any more than the United States or
                                any other country would accept, a treaty arrangement which
                                manifestly deprives them in advance of any say as to how their
                                territory is to be used by another power (i.e., the United States)
                                in hostilities which in the first instance do not involve Japan
                                directly but which Japan might be dragged into against her will by
                                the action of foreign forces operating from her soil. We have no
                                such rights in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, as
                                demonstrated again by the circumstances of the recent agreement with

                            <p>Japan, as does every sovereign power, seeks to exercise control over
                                the use of our bases here, particularly during an emergency, not
                                necessarily because it desires to restrict such use rigidly, but
                                because it wishes to assure that any U.S. actions from these bases
                                involving major consequences for Japan will be taken in consultation
                                and agreement with the Japanese Government and for objectives which
                                the Japanese see as being in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> national
                                interest as well as in ours.</p>
                            <p>Actually, what is much more important than the so-called “right”
                                (which will not be granted us) unilaterally to use bases in Japan
                                for any purposes we see fit, is Japan’s continued alignment with the
                                United States and the continued use of Japan as a logistical base to
                                support our forces in the Far East. I think we all agree that the
                                danger of war breaking out in the Far East is not the danger of
                                planned, overt Communist aggression. The danger is that if there is
                                not adequate deterrent military strength deployed in this area, the
                                Communists might be tempted to use force (just as they did in
                                Korea). Therefore, the continued presence in the <pb n="27"
                                    xml:id="pg_27" facs="0057"/>Far East of the minimum necessary
                                deterrent military strength is vital to the preservation of peace,
                                and Japan is of major importance to the proper deployment and
                                logistical support of our deterrent forces. For example, Admiral
                                Stump told me that if we did not have the two large fleet facilities
                                at Yokosuka and Sasebo and the other naval facility in the
                                Philippines, it would take two-and-a-half times as many ships and
                                men to maintain the 7th Fleet at its present strength in Far Eastern
                                waters. This would involve a terrific additional defense
                                appropriation.</p>
                            <p>Our considered judgment in the Embassy is that our best chance of
                                aligning Japan with the United States for the longer term, and of
                                being able to continue to use Japan for logistical support and
                                deployment purposes, is to revise the Treaty now. On the other side
                                of the coin, we are convinced that the longer we put off making the
                                necessary adjustments, the more the pressures will build up and the
                                latent forces of neutralism and non-involvement will gain ground. In
                                this connection, I would like to remind you that just a year ago
                                great pressures were building up for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
                                When we agreed to withdraw all of our forces if necessary, the steam
                                went completely out of the withdrawal movement. We are convinced
                                that anew mutual security treaty will substantially reduce pressures
                                in Japan for a policy of non-involvement and will certainly have far
                                greater acceptance and support in Japan than the present Security
                                Treaty.</p>
                            <p>Negotiation of a new treaty thus involves a “calculated risk”, but as
                                the Secretary has so often pointed out, all decisions where gains
                                are sought generally involve an element of calculated risk. It is
                                our considered judgment that what I have said above comes as close
                                as we can to the Secretary’s condition that before making a treaty
                                there should be confidence that the very fact of making the change
                                will bring about the basic attitude which we wish to see. A prime
                                example of what we believe may gradually be accomplished following
                                treaty revision is on nuclears. We believe there is a definite
                                possibility that one day Japan will allow us to have nuclear
                                components in Japan (perhaps on somewhat similar terms to what we
                                have with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) and will themselves
                                have at least defensive missiles with a nuclear capability. [<hi

                            <p>On a broader plane, a willingness on our part to revise the Treaty
                                should wipe out resentment of the “one-sided” Security Treaty and
                                greatly improve the climate of public opinion on security and
                                defense matters which now inhibits Japan’s leaders from moving ahead
                                as rapidly as some would like in strengthening Japan’s defense
                                forces and broadening Japan’s security commitments. The
                                Japanese-American Committee on Security has helped for the time
                                being to reduce some suspicions of the “one-sided” nature of
                                US-Japanese security relations. But, the Committee was at best only
                                a temporizing expedient to keep <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"

                                Japanese Government a new arrangement. And, recently the Security
                                Committee has come under progressively heavier criticism not only
                                from the Socialists but also from the press, and even conservative
                                elements, for not studying treaty revision.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the draft treaty would represent the first commitment by
                                Japan to a mutual security arrangement. The proposed treaty area
                                comprises, in our view, what the Japanese can realistically be
                                expected to commit themselves to at present in view of (1) their
                                limited military capabilities, (2) the need to concentrate for the
                                present on building up forces to be deployed in the defense of the
                                Japan area (this, incidentally, is to our immediate benefit since we
                                have forces tied down here which we could perhaps better use
                                elsewhere), and, most important (3) the Japanese interpretation of
                                Article 9 of the Constitution and the barriers in Japan and
                                elsewhere in Asia to use of Japanese troops abroad. I think the
                                treaty area which we envisage must be defined to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> at the outset if we are to go
                                on to constructive discussion of other issues. When Japan is able
                                and willing to play a larger military role in Asia, there will be
                                ample opportunity to broaden the treaty commitments. In fact, given
                                Japan’s past history, I would suspect that the initiative for this
                                may well come eventually from Japan. A mutual security pact with the
                                proposed treaty area is still a substantial advance for Japan. Our

                            <p>Let me say again, I frankly think that we have little choice but to
                                move ahead <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the elections and start
                                quiet talks with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> on a
                                draft treaty along the lines I have proposed. To delay these
                                discussions and treaty revision can only lead to a serious
                                exacerbation of our relations with Japan and encourage the forces in
                                Japan who seek a shift in Japan’s orientation away from the United
                                States. Friendly elements are now in power here and their policy of
                                alignment with the United States still has support. Our willingness
                                to effect treaty revision will strengthen the position of those who
                                believe in Japan’s alignment with the United States. Early treaty
                                revision is, therefore, very much in our own enlightened
                                self-interest.</p>

                            <p>To summarize, in answer to the question raised by the Secretary, it
                                is my judgment that a change in the Security Treaty at this time
                                will in itself help to intensify Japan’s cooperation with the United
                                States over <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0059"/>the subsequent
                                years. I would earnestly hope, therefore, that the necessary steps
                                could be taken in Washington <hi rend="italic">now</hi> so that
                                after the elections and the formation of the new Japanese
                                Government, probably early in June, I would be authorized to
                                initiate talks with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> on
                                treaty revision.</p>
                            <p>On the above basis, I believe we have a good prospect for negotiating
                                a new treaty that will be mutually satisfactory and will contribute
                                to the strengthening of Japan’s alignment with us.</p>

                            <item>A major requirement for the ultimate security of the United States
                                is the ability of the United States to maintain strategic control of
                                the Pacific Ocean. Effective control of that ocean demands secure
                                operating bases for facilitating full exploitation, both defensively
                                and offensively, by United States Military Forces. The United States
                                has major bases in the Ryukyu Islands which can be rapidly expanded
                                in an emergency and which are not dependent upon the political
                                disposition of a foreign sovereign power. In the event of global war
                                or expanded hostilities in which it is necessary to launch attacks,
                                including atomic, against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                                China, or Communist forces elsewhere in the Far East, it is
                                essential that the United States be able to stage operations from
                                these strategically placed bases without curtailment. The entire
                                United States strategic position in the Pacific would be seriously
                                jeopardized if the Ryukyus were to come under the control of Japan,
                                whose political instability <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0060"
                                />might lead to a denial of the use of these bases by U.S. operating

                            <item>Under the provisions of Article 3 of the Japanese Peace Treaty,
                                the United States exercises all and any powers of administration,
                                legislation and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of
                                the Ryukyu Islands. The retention of this authority conflicts with
                                the desire of Japan for the return to it of administrative control
                                over the islands; however, overriding security reasons forbid any
                                reduction in the full control in the Ryukyus now exercised by the

                                Department of State recently requested that the Department of

                                made in order that the Department of State would be afforded the
                                opportunity to seek the advice of the American Ambassador in Japan
                                as to whether he considers it desirable to provide the Japanese

                                this matter. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that it is

                            Minister of Japan regarding the currency conversion proposed for the
                            Ryukyu Islands.</p>
                        <p>This proposal seems to be one of doubtful wisdom, particularly because of
                            its possible effect within Japan. I am sure that the use of American
                            currency in the Islands would be interpreted in Japan as an unexpressed
                            but nevertheless latent ambition of this country to annex those Islands.
                            The mutual friendship and trust that have been built up between our
                            country and Japan are extremely valuable and I do not see why we should
                            chance damaging them in the effort to achieve a greater administrative
                            efficiency.</p>
                        <p>If the Prime Minister of Japan himself recommends the use of American
                            currency because of a favorable effect upon the Ryukyu economy, <pb
                                n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0062"/>and would agree that the
                            consideration would in his mind outweigh any fear of possible future
                            attempts on our part to annex the Islands, then I would be ready to give
                            my approval to the project.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime I suggest that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> be instructed to lay before Premier <persName

                            potential disadvantages of the proposal and to make a complete report to

                            However, because of intense political pressures which issue has

                            was intended to mean. This clarification prompted by informal discussion
                            of fact that, while greater part of unexpended funds have in fact been
                            carried over at end of each fiscal year, in accordance with agreements
                            and with normal Japanese budgeting practice, there are each year certain
                            lapsed funds from prior years which cannot legally be carried over
                            again. There have been such lapses (in other ministries besides Defense

                            antedating yen contribution formula agreement. They have ranged in
                            magnitude from 3 to 6 billion yen. These lapses are of minor nature in
                            relation to over-all Japanese defense performances and of even less
                            importance in relation to our over-all objectives in Japan. Embassy view
                            is that we must consider that there has been “mutually satisfactory

                            is now working on preparation for these talks, with a view to adjusting
                            basic security difficulties with us, including seeking assurances of
                            full consultation and agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> regarding deployment of US forces and their equipment
                            (i.e., nuclears) in Japan and use of US forces based in Japan in
                            hostilities elsewhere in Asia.</p>
                        <p>The strong pressures within Japan for an equal voice in the basic
                            decisions mentioned above, which directly affect Japan’s national
                            interests and security, are the inevitable consequence of Japan’s
                            recovery from postwar weakness to a position as one of the leading
                            nations in the world.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> faced heavy political
                            pressure in the Diet and later in the election campaign to secure
                            assurances from the US regarding introduction of nuclears into Japan, he
                            refused to be stampeded into hasty action. In part, I think, this was
                            due to the fact that I have consistently taken the position with him
                            that until the Japanese elections were over and a new government formed,
                            it was most unwise to try to deal with basic security problems since
                            these issues, which require serious and dispassionate study, would
                            inevitably become enmeshed in the emotional atmosphere of a political
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>However, the time has now come when we must deal with these basic
                            security problems. I cannot emphasize too strongly that if we are
                            interested in Japan’s basic security alignment with US and the free
                            world (which I understand to be one of our basic foreign policy
                            objectives), we must now treat Japan as a full and equal partner, and
                            not try to prolong the present one-sided and unequal arrangements which
                            give US on paper certain “rights” which, however, are totally
                            unenforceable.</p>
                        <p>In other words, in revising the security arrangements, we must be pre-
                            pared to treat Japan on the same basis of equality that we treat our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> and other Allies. We will lose our shirts if we try
                            to hang onto arrangements which, although necessary and appropriate when
                            the agreements were signed, are now overtaken by the evolution of
                            events.</p>
                        <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0065"/>
                        <p>Given the present situation, it seems to me we have only two courses of
                            action. The first would be to resist revising the security treaty and
                            make piecemeal adjustments in our security arrangements, (i.e. on
                            nuclears, deployment and use of US forces in Japan, etc.) giving in
                            reluctantly inch by inch as the pressure and public opinion mount
                            against us. This, I think, would be a disastrous course to follow and
                            could lead to steady erosion of our position in Japan as forces favoring
                            neutralism gain ground by appealing to public sentiment against the
                            inequalities in the present security treaty. The alternative course of
                            action would be for US to take constructive initiative, when <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> raises this matter with me,
                            looking toward a new treaty.</p>
                        <p>Whether we like it or not we are going to have to deal constructively
                            with the problems of nuclears and deployment of forces, etc. I am
                            convinced that it is to our advantage to do so in the context of
                            offering to negotiate a new security treaty which is truly mutual and
                            which would strengthen Japan’s alignment with us rather than by making a
                            series of piecemeal agreements while still holding on to the present
                            security treaty. I say this because the present treaty is extremely
                            vulnerable from the political and psychological viewpoints in Japan
                            because of its one-sided nature.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the treaty area in a new treaty, my own feeling is that
                            we should propose from the outset that the area include the Japanese
                            islands and the Article 3 islands of the peace treaty (Ryukyus and
                            Bonins). This will be a substantial step forward in terms of engaging
                            Japan’s responsibility for mutual defense outside the area of the
                            Japanese home islands and would be, I think, strongly in our interest.
                            It is quite clear that the Japanese Government will resist any
                            commitment to a broader treaty area which requires them to send their
                            forces abroad into Asia or elsewhere not only because of the present
                            interpretation of the constitution but because the public is unprepared
                            as yet to support such a commitment. To ask for such a commitment at
                            this time will be interpreted by the Japanese as a clear indication that
                            we do not in fact desire treaty revision at this time.</p>
                        <p>Until this matter is discussed with <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, I cannot of course say with certainty what his
                            reaction will be to a new treaty even with the limited treaty and
                            concept. However, I think that there is a good prospect of success and,
                            in any event, the very fact that we have offered such a mutual defense
                            treaty will have beneficial effect on those Japanese who were convinced
                            we intend to hold onto our treaty rights to the bitter end, just as our
                            offer last year to withdraw all our forces took all the steam out of the
                            corresponding pressures for total withdrawal of US forces.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I would like to emphasize very strongly that the present
                            atmosphere for constructive discussions with the Japanese is most
                            favorable. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has won a
                            substantial victory at the polls and his position <pb n="36"
                                xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>is strengthened. He believes, as a
                            result of his talks with the President and you last June, that we are in
                            deadly earnest regarding the new era of true partnership and he wishes
                            now to make the adjustments in our security arrangements based on the
                            concept of full equality and partnership which will remove a serious
                            source of potential danger in Japanese-American relations. While the
                            situation is now favorable, it will not remain so indefinitely if we are
                            unable or unwilling to take constructive action. If we do not take
                            constructive action, the very security alignment we want with Japan will
                            be undermined; our relations with Japan envenomed; and at the same time
                            we will be undermining the very leadership in Japan which holds the best
                            promise for bringing Japan in the coming period into a long-term,
                            durable alignment with the US and the free world.</p>

                        <p>Meantime Department has also been working on draft security treaty which

                            draft seemed too closely geared to present political atmosphere in
                            Japan. Accordingly draft language is being modified so that while not
                            inconsistent with present political posture in Japan it would, at same
                            time, permit Japan later on to assume increasing responsibility without
                            necessitating prior revision of the treaty itself. This could be largely
                            accomplished by leaving one or more of the articles “open ended”.

                        <p>In our consideration various problems in US-Japanese relations,
                            Department feels somewhat handicapped by lack complete knowledge

                            are not clear as to how fast and in exactly what direction these moves
                            will take Japan in future. Accordingly before making any firm decisions

                            United States-Japan Security Treaty. Ever since it has been known that
                            the possibility exists that treaty revision may be a subject of
                            discussion, either on the initiation of the Japanese or us, there has
                            naturally been a great deal of interest exhibited here. While there is
                            by no means unaminity of opinion, interest naturally centers around the
                            purely security or military aspects as opposed to the political. The
                            appreciation of the political implications (even possible advantages) of
                            a new treaty is not absent. This is especially true in Admiral Stump’s
                            own thinking and in minds of others on the staff whose minds range more
                            widely over the entire spectrum of United States-Japanese relations.</p>

                            was, as its authors described it, the military community talking in the
                            family. It sets forth the maximum position which the United States
                            should hold for in any possible renegotiation of the Security Treaty. In
                            its present form it is unrealistic beyond description. In terms of
                            United States privileges it goes far beyond what we now enjoy under the
                            Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement. In view of its
                            unrealistic tenor I raised the question as to whether or not it should
                            even be submitted. While agreeing, it was felt that it deserved a place
                            in the basic studies of this problem but should be followed rather
                            rapidly with a more reasonable paper describing the position which, in
                            the viewpoint of this headquarters, should be the minimum position for
                            which we should negotiate if indeed these negotiations ever come to
                            pass. I should like to pass on to you the position which I have taken
                            with respect to this somewhat delicate and obviously controversial
                            subject. In so doing I have naturally tried to keep my advice within the
                            bounds of the studied opinion reflected from the Embassy and the
                            Department. This letter therefore at once becomes not only an interim
                            report on opinion here but a request for continuing guidance in order
                            that I may be as effective as possible in guiding opinion here to an
                            eventual unified position.</p>
                        <p>Procedurally I have pointed out that all that is being contemplated at
                            the moment is that exploratory informal talks at the highest level in
                            Japan may take place. We may discover, when and if these are initiated,
                            that the Japanese do not really desire to negotiate a new treaty at all.
                            We may discover that what <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            and his cohorts of like mind want is a liberal interpretation of the
                            existing treaty to govern our relationships in the security field for
                            some years to come rather than to forge a new one.</p>
                        <p>I may interpose here to say that in my mind there is considerable
                            unjustified suspicion of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            basic motives. I do not think that this is any disappreciation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> as a person but rather
                            an expression of some rather long-standing, ill-defined prejudices.
                            There exists some suspicion that the Japanese are wanting to drive a
                            shrewd bargain, renege on present obligations and free themselves from
                            close identification with the United States and its Asian policy. I have
                            tried to counter this by all of the solid reasoning that has come out of
                            the Embassy at Tokyo which of course recognizes <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> as a Japanese nationalist and
                            undoubtedly a shrewd one (we would not respect him if he were not) but
                            that on balance it is our considered opinion that we have never had the
                            favorable atmosphere since the war in Japan-United States relations <pb
                                n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0070"/>which <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> has been instrumental in creating. Further,
                            Japanese leaders may be very “Japanese” without being anti-American
                            wanting to deal with us on a basis of complete equality. I have pointed
                            out that it is the considered opinion of the Ambassador that if it
                            should transpire that it is to our advantage to express willingness to
                            discuss treaty revision or renegotiation we may be taking advantage of a
                            favorable atmosphere in the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            period which might not be duplicated for some time to come. I have
                            argued that in years to come, looking at this period in retrospect, we
                            might have been much better off to have been willing to discuss treaty
                            revision in an atmosphere where a desire to cooperate exists rather than
                            to have the issue forced upon us by a subsequent more “right” or “left”
                            government in Japan. I hope in saying these things that I have
                            reasonably well reflected the consensus and the philosophy which exists
                            in the Department and in the Embassy at Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Moving into the substantive aspects, I have tried to prepare this Command
                            to recognize that we are just not going to get all that we might desire.
                            The continuation of some of the privileges described in the
                            Administrative Agreement would not be obtainable in a renegotiated
                            treaty; that it may not express the full mutuality with respect to area
                            defense which we would like, and that we should therefore give very
                            careful study to the minimum requirements that the military feel
                            essential in order not to damage our vital security interests in that
                            area of the world. Here are a few comments on some substantive aspects
                            of the question: <list>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Operational Area</hi>. Perhaps most
                                    important for the military, apart from having a treaty at all,
                                    is the question of the area within which we would be permitted
                                    to operate from Japanese bases. Obviously, any restriction
                                    against use of Japanese bases for “hot” defense of Korea,
                                    Formosa and other areas beyond Japanese territory would change
                                    our entire strategic defensive position in Asia and would place
                                    severe limitations on the value of Japanese bases. We might well
                                    lose a war in Asia before it would reach Japanese territory. An
                                    arrangement permitting defense of Japan only will be of strictly
                                    limited value until methods of warfare change more
                                    drastically.</item>

                                <item><p><hi rend="italic">Treaty Area</hi>. This is related to, but
                                        distinct from, the question of the Operational Area.
                                        Ideally, there would be no restriction on either the Treaty
                                        Area or the areas within which we could operate from
                                        Japanese bases. It should be clear to us all, however, that
                                        we are not likely to get such freedom of action or
                                        recognition of such wide identity of interest in a revised
                                        treaty.</p>
                                    <p>Knowing the sensitivity of the Japanese public on both these
                                        issues, perhaps we could aim for language which deals with
                                        attacks on United States and Japanese “interests” (or
                                        “posing a threat to their security”) in the Western Pacific
                                        without being too specific. This would permit each side to
                                        interpret the language broadly for public purposes (a

                                        device) without binding the Japanese Government to
                                        restrictions which it would not want when the chips are
                                        down. Although this would not give the military guaranteed
                                        use of Japanese bases for all defensive purposes, it would
                                        be better than a firm restriction against their use for such
                                        purposes and probably could be sold to them on that
                                        basis.</p></item>

                                        course, want no restriction on their freedom to place

                                        basis for military reluctance to disturb present
                                        arrangements. They ask how it will be possible to insist
                                        upon retention of rights which stem from the very document
                                        which would be opened for renegotiation. They fear that one
                                        of the possibilities inherent in opening the question for
                                        negotiation is the danger that the Japanese will prefer no
                                        treaty to one which gives them less than they want. In
                                        short, they tend to feel, Japan has everything to gain and
                                        nothing to lose by any change in the present arrangements.
                                        We, on the other hand, they feel, have little to gain and
                                        much to lose. I need hardly add that we in <gloss

                                        the present treaty is uniquely one-sided and will be worth
                                        little to us if it alienates Japan and the Japanese. We need
                                        to remind ourselves rather frequently that a treaty is not
                                        worth much more than the actual mutuality to which the
                                        agreement only gives expression.</p></item>

                                    here that the Japanese will seek to restrict our freedom to

                                    While the staff here are not sanguine about their chances of
                                    getting uninhibited entry rights in the future, they will

                                    here have no serious quarrel with the present arrangements. Any

                                    Immigration and customs treatment relate directly to the
                                    question of personnel and goods. On the official level, for
                                    personnel and equipment, the military will insist that any
                                    future arrangements be entirely consistent with their
                                    operational and strategic requirements. With regard to taxation

                        <p>Just how far our military advisers will go in pressing for the view that
                            a renegotiation of the treaty must be made contingent upon the Japanese
                            willingness to take unilateral steps, I am not sure. They feel initially
                            that we should ask for Japanese constitutional amendment, assurance that
                            they will meet certain force goals in their own defense buildup,
                            strengthen security legislation within Japan, etc. As desirable as these
                            may be, in private conversation I have pointed out that we are not
                            likely to get any such far-reaching commitments from the Japanese in
                            what to them appear to be purely domestic matters with which we have no
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>In discussing this whole matter of possible United States-Japan
                            discussions of treaty renegotiation, I recognize that we are talking
                            about two possible documents; first, the broadly-worded Mutual Security
                            Treaty and secondly, something to take the place of the Administrative
                            Agreement which would undoubtedly grow out of the second treaty much as
                            the current Administrative Agreement grew out of the first. Undoubtedly
                            detailed military interest will be much greater in the provisions of the
                            new Administrative Agreement than in the treaty itself.</p>
                        <p>I hope that this discussion of this question will be helpful to
                            Washington and Tokyo in assessing some of the views here.</p>

                            pointing out that in recent election, although domestic political issues
                            existed such as education and labor policy, <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss> and Socialists were widest apart in fields of foreign
                            affairs and defense. Election results gave clear evidence of majority
                            support for government policies in these fields. Elections reaffirmed
                            that public supports maintenance of joint Japanese-US security ties as
                            integral part of US-Japan partnership. Questions relating to operation
                            of US-Japan security ties which require very serious review at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> recalled that PriMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> prior to his visit to
                            Washington in 1957 raised two main points: 1) adjustment of security
                            treaty in view of changing circumstances, specifically–a) arrangement
                            that use and disposition of US forces based on Japan be determined in
                            principle by agreement of both governments; b) clarification of
                            relationship between treaty and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter; c) establishment of time limit for treaty. 2) Second point made
                            by <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was hope US would reduce
                            its forces in Japan as far as possible in light of self defense force
                            buildup. Both points were discussed fully in Washington. As result,
                            Japanese-American security committee was established to handle problems
                            relating to treaty and, as regards second point, US reduced its forces
                            considerably and withdrew all its ground combat forces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said that looking back at
                            year’s developments since <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            visit, there have been encouraging signs and much progress. Reduction of
                            US forces has stimulated sense of Japanese responsibility for defense of
                            own country and Japanese-American Security Committee has had very
                            favorable effect on US-Japan efforts in security field. However, during
                            same time <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has announced success in
                            development of missiles and satellites and has launched major
                            psychological offensive <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0074"/>aimed at
                            creating doubts regarding advisability of depending on US deterrent
                            power. Soviets have also fostered idea that local war is impossible and
                            therefore non-nuclear arms are meaningless. These and other factors and
                            problems remaining in US-Japan security relations require current review
                            of our security ties.</p>

                            security adjustments, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            made following points: <list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item>Basic position of Japanese Govt is that some form of long term
                                    security ties with US are, under present circumstances,
                                    essential given huge power of Sino-Soviet Bloc. This was
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s view last year
                                    and there has been no change since then.</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>Existing security treaty is worded so as to give impression
                                    that it is entirely one-sided in favor of US. There are various
                                    expressions in treaty indicating US can act entirely at its own
                                    discretion with respect to use of its forces in Japan. These
                                    aspects of treaty were developed at time when Japan had no
                                    defense power and were quite logical at that time. However,
                                    circumstances have changed.</item>
                                <label>3)</label>
                                <item>Japan desires that its security relationship with US now be
                                    placed on durable, dependable and mutually acceptable
                                    basis.</item>
                                <label>4)</label>
                                <item>There are various alternative methods to accomplish this
                                    objective: <list>
                                        <label>a)</label>
                                        <item>If at all possible, it would be most desirable to
                                            replace existing treaty with new mutual security treaty.
                                            However, under its constitution Japan cannot dispatch
                                            its self defense forces abroad to US or other
                                            non-Japanese territory. If, as in past, US continues to
                                            insist that to enter a mutual security treaty Japan must
                                            obligate herself to send her troops abroad, then such a
                                            mutual security treaty is not feasible at this
                                            time.</item>

                            to my Govt views which he had expressed but one of things I felt sure it
                            would wish to know was which of two alternatives for adjusting existing

                            <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> really preferred (i.e.,
                            adjustments without changing present security treaty or new mutual
                            security treaty for “Japan area”). I said while I did not have
                            instructions which would enable me to discuss these alternatives with
                            him and did not know what Washington’s reactions would be to specific
                            suggestions he had made, I was sure <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s preference re suggested alternatives would be
                            important. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he would
                            be absent from Tokyo next week but would be discussing this matter with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and would pass on to me
                            later any comments or observations latter might have.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that in view of extreme sensitivity of entire problem of
                            security arrangements, info on our discussion now and in future would be
                            limited on both sides on a need-to-know basis, since any premature
                            airing of these problems in press could only create major and adverse
                            repercussions.</p>

                            following are my preliminary reactions:</p>

                            <item><p>First, it is essential that we recognize need during
                                    forthcoming months to make some vital adjustments in our
                                    existing security arrangements with Japan, if we do not wish
                                    over period of next several years to have existing arrangements
                                    undermined and crumble away with nothing satisfactory from our
                                    viewpoint to replace them. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> desires to make adjustments which, having
                                    our own long-term security and other interests in this vital
                                    area in mind, will, in my judgement, serve to strengthen and
                                    make more durable our security ties with Japan. If we reject
                                    this overture, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, I am
                                    afraid, may gradually be forced to move in contrary direction.
                                    He does not wish to do this and believes he can work out
                                    acceptable adjustments in spirit of new era of full equality and
                                    partnership which the President enunciated to him.</p>
                                <p>It should be understood clearly that in seeking adjustments in
                                    our security arrangements, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> Govt is not acting only under pressure of
                                    opposition and press criticism which crops up every time
                                    Socialists agitate this question in Diet, but also on pressure
                                    from elements within Conservative Party. Fact is that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is trying to act before
                                    such public pressures develop to intensity which would make
                                    negotiations with US much more difficult. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Govt is also acting on
                                    basis that Japan has now in fact reacquired its sovereignty and
                                    that its national interests dictate that it be in a position to
                                    exercise its sovereign power over decisions vitally affecting
                                    Japan’s interest. This is same attitude that has been
                                    consistently taken by our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    Allies and which we have fully accepted, particularly insofar as
                                    introduction of nuclear weapons or use of our forces stationed
                                    in their countries. Failure of <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> Govt to seek equal voice with US on
                                    security decisions vitally affecting Japan’s interest would be
                                    considered derogation of its responsibilities to country and
                                    people and serve to undermine <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName>. And let me emphasize again that there is
                                    nobody in sight here with whom we can work as well or as frankly
                                    as with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>.</p>
                                <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0077"/>
                                <p>Furthermore, adjustments desired by <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> Govt are basically recognition of
                                    realities of current US-Japanese security relations and not new
                                    departures. If we attempted to exercise the so-called “right” to
                                    use our military forces in Japan to conduct military operations
                                    from bases in Japan in hostilities outside Japan without first
                                    seeking Japanese consent or to introduce nuclear weapons into
                                    Japan without Japanese consent, not only would our whole
                                    security relationship with Japan collapse but Japanese Govt
                                    would undoubtedly take effective steps to inhibit any further
                                    use of our bases in Japan. Whether we like it or not, this is
                                    reality of Japanese-US relations today and we are going to have
                                    to live with it.</p></item>

                        <p>Although Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> did
                            not recommend the introduction of dollar currency, he said that he
                            understood the reasons which led us to desire the currency conversion.
                            He believed that, although the conversion would create an adverse
                            reaction in Japan and some difficulties, nevertheless, in view of the
                            importance we attached to it, he could live with it if the announcement
                            could be delayed until a reasonable interval after the adjournment of
                            the Diet. He pointed out that a conversion announcement made while the
                            Diet was in session would be picked up by the Socialists and would risk
                            inflaming again the entire Okinawan issue. He assumed that prior to the
                            announcement of conversion there would be a favorable decision by the
                            United States on the Okinawan land compensation policy and perhaps on
                            other constructive measures. He also expressed a desire to see the draft
                            currency announcement reasonably in advance of its issuance.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the points raised by Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> concerning the timing of the
                            announcement: (1) The Diet is presently not in session but will
                            reconvene on September 20. If an announcement on currency conversion is
                            to be made, it should be made before the first of September. Otherwise
                            we will run a chance of trouble with the Diet. (2) The Departments of
                            State, Defense and Army have agreed on the outline of a new land
                            compensation program which should prove acceptable <pb n="51"

                                                responsibilities which “mutual defense” treaty would
                                                impose, and to its recognition that negotiating and
                                                ratifying a new treaty would be much more hazardous
                                                political undertaking than would be revision of
                                                current treaty. To encourage Japan to ask for more
                                                than she is inclined to seek does not appear wise in

                                                concessions granted therein should be given up
                                                lightly. Furthermore any liberalization of treaty
                                                relations with Japan may lead to acrimonious and

                                                It would not be to U.S. interest to make only

                                                limit weapons and areas of employment for U.S.
                                                forces represent unacceptable restrictions. The U.S.
                                                could not adequately discharge its obligation to

                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, the Prime
                            Minister had made a formal proposal for a mutual security treaty and had
                            requested that this proposal be brought to the President’s attention.
                            Tokyo’s telegram 444<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Dated August 26.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that
                            two courses of action were open to the Japanese: (1) to retain the
                            present security treaty with all its unilateral aspects and to have a
                            side arrangement covering consultation prior to the introduction of
                            nuclears and to the operation of United States forces from bases in
                            Japan; or (2) to negotiate a new mutual security treaty with provision
                            in exchange of notes or a communiqué to take care of the same two
                                points.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">According to telegram 444
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> preferred the second
                                alternative, principally on the ground that the one-sided nature of
                                the existing treaty made it a vulnerable target for Socialist
                                attacks.</note> Opinion was divided among the Japanese as to which
                            course was desirable. The Conservatives were split. Some thought Japan
                            should serve as a bridge between the East and West; to these people, a
                            mutual security treaty was undesirable because it would commit Japan to
                            the United States and would alienate Asians. Some conservatives thought
                            that a mutual security treaty would anger the Chinese Communists. Still
                            other Conservatives, including the Foreign Minister himself, were afraid
                            that the signing of a mutual security treaty would result in a
                            knock-down, drag-out fight and that this ought to be avoided.<note n="4"

                            Japanese for a mutual security treaty. Fortunately, we do not have to
                            because Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            himself proposed such a treaty a month or two after Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>, on the basis of the
                            Secretary’s instructions, had opened the matter with him last spring. In
                            this connection, said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>, failure on our part to grant a new treaty and
                            in doing so to be able to propose our own language on the two points
                            concerned, would make inevitable an approach from the Japanese on these
                            two points, obliging us to agree not only to the principle but to their
                            specific language. The Socialist party at the present time was preparing
                            two draft resolutions for the forthcoming regular session of the Diet,
                            one concerning the non-introduction of nuclears without the agreement of
                            the Japanese Government and the other concerning the operational use of
                            United States bases in Japan without Japanese consent.<note n="5"

                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> would be able to prevent the passage of these
                            resolutions if we agreed to negotiate a treaty. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had told him that he
                            could forestall the passage of the resolutions if a treaty were under
                            negotiation. [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] He remarked that the Australian Ambassador to
                            Japan had expressed to him the greatest surprise and pleasure that the
                            Japanese Government was voluntarily seeking a mutual security treaty
                            with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that
                            the Japanese were ready to move now. If we ourselves did not act quickly
                            the situation would deteriorate. We would be faced with a formal request
                            to refrain from introducing nuclears and to refrain from operating out
                            of our bases prior to Japanese approval; and we would be saddled with an
                            unpopular unilateral treaty as well. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, Commander in Chief, Pacific, had
                            expressed his thorough approval of entering into negotiations for a
                            mutual security treaty, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> stated, and he read from a telegram prepared
                            by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName><note n="6"
                                xml:id="d23fn6">Apparently a telegram from <persName

                                in telegram 522 from Tokyo, September 3: “Adm. <persName

                                desirable to remove one-sided or unequal aspects of treaty. General
                                language and particularly of preamble can be recast. US national
                                policy recognizes Japan as equal in family of nations. New or
                                revised treaty should reflect this policy. Consultation with <gloss

                                I believe this can be settled on terms acceptable to both parties.’”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> went on to
                                say that “Adm. <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> raised
                                certain other problems but none of them present any major obstacles
                                as far as I can see.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                611.94/9–358) See Supplement.</note> to this effect. He concluded by
                            saying that the <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0090"/>Admiral agreed
                            that we would “lose our shirt” if we did not move now. By avoiding a new

                            and at that time the atmosphere for negotiating a new treaty would be
                            very bad. However, armed with the present United States draft (draft
                            originally prepared by the Embassy in Tokyo and amended in the
                                Department)<note n="7" xml:id="d23fn7">See Tab A to <ref

                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> for joint
                            consultation, in accordance with a similar formula governing the use of
                            our bases in the United Kingdom. This formula would be interpreted by
                            the Japanese Government to the Diet as meaning that the Government would
                            deny the United States the right to use its bases in Japan operationally
                            or to bring in nuclear weapons. However, this formula was much better
                            for us than such terms as the Japanese Government would have to demand
                            of us if the two Socialist resolutions passed. There was a 50–50 chance
                            of getting our own language if we proposed it as part of a package
                            including a new treaty. If the Japanese Government formally asked for
                            our agreement to refrain from bringing in nuclears or using our bases
                            operationally without their prior consent as opposed to consultation, we
                            would have to do it, as we did in the case of the British and French and
                            as Australia had to do with respect to Malaya; if we did not we would
                            face a break with Japan.</p>
                        <p>The significance of Japan going into a long-term defense treaty with us
                            was incalculable psychologically and politically. Moreover, it had
                            definite practical benefits. For example, without Yokosuka and Sasebo we
                            would have to employ 2-1/2 times the number of ships to maintain and
                            supply the 7th Fleet.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> believed the United States position should be
                            as follows: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>To listen to the Japanese proposal which would be set forth by
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and which
                                    Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                                    would repeat.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>To respond by saying that we favored the proposal in
                                    principle, but that it raised difficult problems; we would be
                                    glad to give the matter urgent study but we must consult the
                                    leadership of the Senate and this we would do
                                    expeditiously.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If the United States adopted this position, we could tell the Japanese
                            that we would hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> would be ready by October at the latest to
                            enter into discussions. (He himself would rather bring the matter
                            directly to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            before Foreign Minister <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0091"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> could return to Tokyo.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> would be
                            returning to Tokyo September 17.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> brought out that
                            Tokyo telegram 444 had not been brought to the President’s attention
                            because the President had been preoccupied at that time by the Quemoy
                            situation, and that he himself (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>) and the Secretary had been out of the
                            Department. It had seemed best to get a more unified opinion before
                            submitting the matter to the President. The Secretary said that no harm
                            had been done, though it would not be right for the Department of State
                            to hold up indefinitely a message which the head of a foreign government
                            had transmitted to our President.</p>
                        <p>With respect to our present Security Treaty, we had taken great
                            precautions, said the Secretary, to avoid giving the impression that it
                            was being forced on the Japanese. We had signed it only after the Peace
                            Treaty had been signed and we had taken the chance that the Diet would
                            ratify only the Peace Treaty and not ratify the Security Treaty.
                            (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> pointed
                            out that the leaders of the conservatives were committed to the security
                            arrangements at that time.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> whether he had any reason to think that a
                            future Japanese Government and Diet might not think of the mutual
                            security treaty now under contemplation as but a step in the process of
                            breaking Japanese shackles to the United States. Would it not be
                            reasonable to assume that they might regard it in the same light
                            psychologically as the old Security Treaty? Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> regarded this as
                            unnecessarily apprehensive. The Secretary pointed out that he had
                            mentioned this possibility in order to demonstrate that we had to deal
                            with the present situation so as to forestall the development of such a
                            point of view later on. For example, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had said that he had
                            discouraged the Japanese from presenting their own draft so as to be
                            able to present our draft first, but if our draft were presented first,
                            how would this support the thesis that the Japanese were pressing us for
                            this treaty?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> read aloud
                            a Japanese newspaper editorial which demonstrated Japanese desire for a
                            new treaty to strengthen their defensive arrangements with the United
                            States and their desire to include the two points concerned. The general
                            reaction of the press of Japan was very gratifying. However, if it were
                            necessary for the record to provide evidence of Japanese initiative, it
                            would be best to ask the Japanese for a piece of paper. Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that a piece of paper would not
                            mean much psychologically. A treaty to be acceptable would have to
                            demonstrate the solidarity of Japan and United States in the Far East.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> asserted
                            that the Japanese would not commit themselves to a common policy if that
                            meant only a United <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0092"/>States
                            policy; however, they would want a long-range defense tie-up with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said: the question was, what was the national sentiment
                            behind treaty revision? Was the primary drive to tie up Japan with the
                            United States or to disengage Japan from the United States? Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that the
                            Prime Minister would tell the Japanese Diet and Japan that Japanese
                            defense was dependent upon a long-term durable security relationship
                            with the United States. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, he said, does not want Japan to be neutral nor
                            Communist. However, it would not be possible in the Ambassador’s
                            estimation to guarantee how the Japanese press would react. The
                            Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            could get the treaty ratified and adopted not so much as an escape but
                            as a step toward closer cooperation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MTE1"
                                >Morgan</persName> referred to a Tokyo telegram which used Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s own language and
                            stated that a treaty of this sort could be used to lead Japan to a
                            closer alignment with the United States. The Secretary said that when he
                            went to Congress to sell this treaty he would have to do it on the
                            ground that Japan was casting its lot with us; he could not say that it
                            was because the Japanese were becoming rebellious against the present
                            treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            the Japanese complaint that the treaty was one-sided was a relatively
                            new complaint just within the last few years, and principally under
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>; former Prime
                            Ministers had been happy to accept the arrangement which it
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">J. Graham Parsons</persName> remarked
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would have to
                            defend the new treaty for Diet ratification as getting rid of the “old,
                            unequal treaty”. This was a public fact of life. Japan was moving back
                            into an important role in international life and Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wanted Japan to play
                            that role in association with the United States. The new treaty would
                            provide a catalytic effect. As an island country, Japan had always found
                            it difficult to commit itself closely for an indefinite period with any
                            foreign country. However, the Anglo-Japanese alliance had established a
                            useful long-term relationship. A new mutual security treaty in that
                            respect could be expected to do the same thing in our case.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> pointed out
                            that a little over a year ago Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had been here. He had wanted the Bonin Islanders
                            repatriated and he had wanted Japanese participation in Ryukyuan
                            administration. Finding us immovable, however, he had given up these
                            requests; he did not wish to cause us trouble.</p>
                        <p>At this point, there was a discussion to clarify the difference between
                            “operational use of bases” and “deployment of United States forces”.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> pointed
                            out that the Defense Department was not interested at all in the new
                            treaty language, but only in the <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"
                            />two points concerning the operational use of bases or the introduction
                            of nuclears and in the terms of the administrative agreement.</p>
                        <p>(Reporter absent a few minutes to obtain a document.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that
                            Japan would represent no predatory danger unless it were absorbed into
                            and became part of Sino-Soviet bloc, in which case, as one of the four
                            primary industrial areas of the world, it would present a danger to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was less interested in what we might get
                            technically in a mutual security treaty than what we could win in
                            Japanese psychological alignment with the free world. Japan had been
                            slower than Germany in regaining its pride and national spirit. He had
                            felt for a long time that when the spirit did re-emerge the Japanese
                            would recognize the indispensability of a security relationship with the
                            United States against the neighboring Communist area.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> pointed out
                            differences between Japan and Germany. It had been possible to bring
                            Germany into alliance through a collective approach both economically
                            and militarily. Japan was historically isolated not only from the West
                            but also from the remainder of Asia. With the recent experience of
                            alienation from other Asians by its military adventure preceding and
                            during World War II Japan was not susceptible to (and would not be drawn
                            into the free world orbit militarily speaking through) a collective
                            approach. The only possible approach was through alignment with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his concurrence and remarked that he would have
                            to proceed with the practical arrangements for getting a unified United
                            States position. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> said that it seemed to him that we must
                            consult with Defense. The Secretary asked if we had a draft mutual
                            security treaty. It was presented to him and he read it. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that it
                            followed the pattern of our other mutual security treaties in the
                            Pacific area. The operational article was Article V. As the meeting
                            broke up, it was agreed that Defense representatives would be invited to
                            confer with State Department representatives in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s office the following
                            day.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows the beginning of the memorandum; see Supplement.]</p>
                        <p>Copies of the draft mutual security treaty (which had been prepared by
                            our Embassy in Tokyo in the first instance, and amended in the
                            Department) were passed around the table. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that the draft
                            represented a relationship broader than a mere military alliance. The
                            draft mentioned economic cooperation and so on, and contained the
                            standard language up to Article V–the operative article.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> raised the question
                            with respect to the phrase “constitutional processes”. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> said we hoped Japan would change
                            its constitution to allow its forces to be used abroad. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that the
                            Japanese constitution did not forbid self-defense. The reference to
                            “constitutional processes” meant that Japan would not want to send its
                            forces to non-Japanese territory for the present. But neither had any
                            other ally of ours agreed in advance to send forces to our aid.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked where the

                            Treaty but by an exchange of notes relating to the Peace Treaty and that
                            it would still be valid although the Security Treaty were replaced. He
                            then read aloud the operative portion of the exchange of notes between
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_ADG2">Acheson</persName> and
                            Japanese Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName>
                            dated September 8, 1951.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">For text, see 3

                            this language would not be tampered with.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> remarked that this
                            would not help in United States action in the Taiwan Straits. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> agreed it would
                            not help unless it were a United Nations action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> underlined
                            the fact that in his estimation by entering the proposed mutual security
                            treaty we would be putting our security relations with Japan on the same
                            basis as that of all our other allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                                >Irwin</persName> acknowledged this but noted that possibly an
                            exception would be the limitation the Japanese would put on our use of
                            Japan in defense operations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> in turn agreed by pointing out that we could
                            not use British territory either, without their consent. To this General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> responded by
                            saying that if we were to ask Japan we would be refused, while we would
                            not be refused if we were to ask England. [<hi rend="italic">9 lines of

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> commented
                            that the Japanese Foreign Office had a draft treaty calling for
                            consultation and agreement on the introduction of nuclears. The British
                            formula of 1952, omitting joint decision and putting in joint
                            consultation, might be sold to the Japanese–at least in a package with
                            the new treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> could
                            table the Socialist resolution in the Diet on the grounds that
                            discussions covering these problems were in process with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> did not like the idea of consultation
                            and pointed out that it would stymie us in the Taiwan Straits. Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> remarked that the British would agree to
                            let us use their bases in emergency. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> did not think that this was
                            certain. He pointed out that we could not use bases in Europe in
                            countries not involved. If we were to use bases in Japan against Japan’s
                            will, we would close off the Japanese labor force and the utilities used
                            by our bases. Take Greece, he said. Admiral <persName>Burke</persName>
                            interrupted to agree that the Greek and Japanese situations were
                            similar. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            said we could not treat Japan differently from our other allies. If we
                            did so, we would go out of business. Should there be an attack on
                            Taiwan, we would, no doubt, get <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0096"
                            />the consent of the Japanese to use our bases there, but not if the
                            attack were only against the off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that the
                            Ambassador had pointed out the logistic use of our bases in Japan. If
                            you were to remove both the Japanese and Philippine bases, we would have
                            no real bases west of Guam. If you could not use bases in Japan and the
                            Philippines and if our national policy was to defend Quemoy and Matsu,
                            you were saying that the Defense Department must be prepared to operate
                            from Hawaii, Guam, and the West Coast. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> disagreed, pointing out
                            that this was true only of operations and not of logistics. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said he thought we
                            had a problem. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> did not think we could afford to base our
                            plans on invalid assumptions.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> thought we had better pull out of
                            Japan if we could not count on her. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said we could count on
                            Japan for Korea, Taiwan and the Pescadores, but not for the off-shore
                            islands. However, this was academic. If we did not move now, Japan would
                            confront us with a demand and we would have no recourse but to comply.
                            Japan was one of the four major industrial complexes in the world.
                            Japan’s position in Asia and the world was steadily becoming more
                            important. If Japan went neutral, our military men could scratch South
                            Asia. These other Asians would run foot races to Peiping. Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>How did we then align Japan with us, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> asked, and answered himself
                            by stating two means: (1) economic arrangements, and (2) acceptable
                            security arrangements. Moreover, we would have to meet this problem
                            before the Diet convened.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> asserted that Japan needed us more
                            than we needed Japan. We would not want to force Japan into neutralism,
                            but we would gain nothing by trying to buy Japanese favor. We could not
                            give Japan more control over our operations than we gave to the
                            Philippines or to the Taiwanese. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had already told the Diet that the
                            “new era” required the United States to get Japan’s agreement prior to
                            bringing in nuclears. There was no point in our driving <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> out of business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> suggested that we be
                            more clean cut in the agreement and say “joint decision” rather than
                            just “joint consultation”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                                >Sprague</persName> expressed his preference to keeping
                            “consultation” but if the Japanese did not buy it we would have had it
                            anyway. He felt that our taking this up with them now was the best
                            insurance of keeping their cooperation in the future. Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> thought that this would make the use of
                            our bases uncertain. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            said we would have that problem any- way. He asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> whether his formula
                            language covered nuclears. The Ambassador said that it did in the phrase
                            “forces <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/><hi rend="italic">and
                                their equipment</hi>”. He did not want to make a special category of
                            nuclears.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (6 lines of source text) not

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said he took it
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> was
                            for a new treaty. He himself had been in on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Treaty presentation to the Senate Committee with
                            General Bradley <note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">General Omar N.
                                Bradley.</note> and they had taken a terrible beating on the
                            “mutuality” aspect. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> said that he had appeared on the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty. A lot of water had gone
                            over the dam before <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and no
                            problem had arisen at that time. He foresaw no difficulty with respect
                            to the mutuality aspect of the proposed treaty with Japan. He had
                            talked, he said, with Senators Sparkman and <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"

                            all for a mutual security treaty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> remarked that if we
                            were starting from scratch, their making available of bases itself would
                            be a great concession toward mutuality. Of course, we would have to face
                            the necessity of revising our arrangements with the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName>, speaking to the
                            Defense people, said that they wanted the United States to get from
                            Japan a commitment it would let us use bases in Japan whenever we were
                            carrying out our treaty obligations with other countries. Our President
                            could not give such a commitment and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1"
                                >Becker</persName> doubted if any Government could.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked what if
                            we should wish to send fighter bombers from Japan to Taiwan. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> thought this
                            merely a matter of deployment and that it would raise no problem. The
                            problem was in mounting strikes from Japanese bases.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> reiterated
                            that the present treaty was no longer viable. This was our chance to
                            align Japan firmly with the United States. If we failed to move we would
                            be faced with a demand which would stymie us.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> said that if the draft treaty were
                            accepted we would have to have a new Administrative Agreement.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> agreed and
                            pointed out that conservatives in Japan were now studying what type of
                            administrative agreement would best suit the needs of our forces in
                            Japan. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            gave his opinion that if we meet <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s two requests we would have no other problems
                            with respect to matters covered by the Administrative Agreement. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked whether the
                            Japanese had indicated what part of <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68"
                                facs="0098"/>the Administrative Agreement they wanted abolished.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> replied
                            that they had not done so; they merely wanted the two points mentioned
                            to appear either in the Administrative Agreement or in an exchange of
                            notes. We certainly did not want it in the treaty. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that we did not want it
                            in the Administrative Agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1"
                                >Becker</persName> thought that Article VI was broad enough to
                            include the points in the Administrative Agreement. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> suggested that the formula
                            might appear in a minute of the negotiations; the Japanese would not
                            care.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Lang</persName> noted that the Administrative Agreement
                            already provides for consultation in the event of hostility. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> thought this
                            referred to activities in the area of Japan itself.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> noted that
                            according to the draft this treaty could be abrogated with one year’s
                            notice. We had no other treaty like that, so far as he knew. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> replied that we
                            have such treaties with all the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            countries. Moreover, the President last year had told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that we did not wish to keep
                            forces where they were not wanted. This assertion had taken all the
                            steam out of Japan’s move to get our forces out. The Secretary had
                            frequently said that any treaty was durable so long as it reflected the
                            interest of the parties and that it failed when it no longer reflected
                            them. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> brought
                            out that the Philippine base agreement had 89 years to go<note n="5"

                                1960, vol. XV, pp. 946–957.</note> and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangements were based on 20 years
                            duration. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            responded that even under the present Security Treaty we would have to
                            pull our troops out if Japan denounced it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLE1">Becker</persName> noted that Article V of
                            the draft treaty made the treaty operable in case of attack not just in
                            the area of Japan but anywhere in the Pacific. Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> said he preferred “naval” to “sea” in
                            Article VI, referring to the types of United States forces in Japan,
                            since “naval” included the Marines. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                                >Sprague</persName> said it would be better if there were a
                            long-range commitment on Japan’s part to provide bases for our forces.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> noted that
                            it was in Japan’s economic interests to keep our forces. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that those
                            economic interests were not superior to the political push to get our
                            ground forces out of Japan last year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> stated his opinion
                            that it would not be possible to get a final decision on these points at
                            the present meeting. He asked what the State Department wanted to tell
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that the
                            Secretary of State would table no papers, that he would tell the
                            Japanese we would study their proposal with interest. <pb n="69"
                                xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/>He would agree that the time had come to
                            make certain adjustments, that while in principle we were disposed to
                            enter a mutual security treaty and get a mutually acceptable agreement
                            on the two points, the question of a treaty would raise the need to
                            consult the Senate. Congress was out of session but we would talk to
                            individual Senators and we would plan to be ready to sit down early in
                            October to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> remarked
                            that he himself was anxious for tactical reasons to start with our
                            papers rather than theirs in such negotiations. The Secretary had told
                            him last night that he might have minor changes to recommend in the
                            draft. There was no problem in changing “sea” to “naval” and so on. We
                            would discuss these changes with the Defense Department when it was
                            determined how the Secretary viewed them.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> said that what they needed to do in
                            the Defense Department was to work out how they would want the formula
                            and treaty interpreted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> had already given his interpretation, namely, that
                            the President would consult on the two points concerned and would not
                            move without Japanese agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                                >Sprague</persName> said Defense was willing to go along with the
                            position which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> had described, without mention of specific
                            wording of the agreement. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> said that it was necessary to spell out the
                            United Nations matter. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> said that he would do that when he sat down
                            with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. It posed no problem.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that this
                            removed a big problem so far as he was concerned. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said that the Secretary could
                            be informed that Defense agreed to his assuring Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> that the United States was
                            ready to consider a mutual security treaty and related arrangements.</p>

                                        text.]</note> by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on the
                                    above subject, dated 8 August 1958, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                    have considered the three problems which you noted therein. They
                                    agree that possible changes to the present treaty, which are
                                    listed in <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0101"/>Appendix “A”
                                    hereto, are acceptable. Further, they agree that the
                                    considerations which are listed in Appendix “B” hereto are
                                    essential for inclusion within a renegotiated treaty and
                                    administrative agreement, should that course of action be
                                    adopted. It is their opinion, however, that it should be the
                                    position of Defense to advocate making changes within the
                                    present treaty, if possible through the medium of an exchange of
                                    notes between the governments of the United States and Japan,
                                    not requiring Congressional ratification. Although the above
                                    represents the preferred position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                    in this matter, there are no overriding military objections to
                                    negotiation of a new treaty if political considerations so
                                    dictate and an adequate quid pro quo can be obtained for the
                                    concession.</item>

                                        <item>With regard to introduction of nuclear weapons in
                                            Japan, including visits of U.S. ships with nuclear
                                            armaments there is virtually no prospect of a solution
                                            which will satisfy both sides. The “atom bomb” in any
                                            context still remains in Japan a matter of the utmost
                                            emotional intensity. Until such time as this feeling
                                            moderates to manageable proportions it would be
                                            altogether unrealistic to expect to obtain Japanese
                                            agreement for the introduction of nuclear components
                                            into Japan, although this remains a highly desirable
                                            military objective toward which to work. It therefore
                                            appears advisable now to seek to maintain the status quo
                                            with respect to weapons in Japan.</item>

                                    any discussions to be held with the Japanese on this subject,
                                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that this is a matter of such
                                    far-reaching implications involving so many other, though
                                    possibly less vital, considerations that opportunity should be
                                    provided for more definite study. They recommend, therefore,
                                    that in the forthcoming informal meetings with Mr. <persName

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting by saying that he welcomed these talks
                            pursuant to our mutual desire to draw closer and find ways to be helpful
                            to each other. He recalled vividly, he said, the prior visit of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> and also that of
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. He believed
                            that the past talks between the Prime Minister and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had historic significance as
                            the beginning of a new stage in our relations. It was natural and normal
                            that these should develop into a new epoch.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> replied
                            that he, too, was very glad of this opportunity to meet with the
                            Secretary and engage in talks. As you know, he said, the Government of
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> won a
                            majority in the Japanese elections last May, and as a result had been
                            established on a long-term stable basis for four years. United
                            States-Japanese relations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said, were the cornerstone of Japanese foreign
                            policy. It is appropriate from that aspect to take account of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s desire to proceed from
                            the talks which he had had with the President and the Secretary last
                            year and further develop ties of strength.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> desired to proceed with the meeting. The second
                            item on the agenda, security relations, was perhaps the most important,
                            but he would be glad to follow any order Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> suggested. The Foreign Minister agreed that the
                            second item should be taken up, in view of time limitations, and
                            remarked that the substance of the first item, the world situation,
                            would no doubt come up in passing. The Secretary invited Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> to begin his presentation.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> knew, the Foreign Minister began, a
                            considerable time has gone by since the Security Treaty was concluded.
                            Changes have taken place in the political, economic and defense
                            situations in <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"/>Japan, and a
                            considerable maturity has also developed in the thinking of the Japanese
                            people. It is against that background that he would like to begin his
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>While the Japanese Self Defense Forces, he went on, are not perfectly
                            ideal because of financial limitations, still qualitatively and
                            quantitatively they have developed to the point where they have a
                            considerable effectiveness as armed forces. Moreover, Japan’s status in
                            the international community has improved, thanks to United States
                            cooperation and help, and Japan is a member of the United Nations. The
                            people of Japan have a strong desire to project themselves as an
                            independent and self-reliant country. The recent elections testify to
                            the fact that 80 percent of the Japanese people want Japan, as an
                            independent country, to collaborate fully with the United States.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these circumstances, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> went on, certain elements in the Security
                            Treaty tend to provoke the thinking of the people. They feel that the
                            time has come to consider revising the Security Treaty or conforming our
                            security arrangements to the present situation. This is the strong
                            desire of the Prime Minister. The public in Japan thinks that, in
                            comparison with the United States treaties with the Philippines and with
                            Taiwan, they lack independence and initiative under our treaty with
                            Japan. So long as this thinking exists, it will be harmful to United
                            States-Japanese relations.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that there were three approaches to
                            changes in our security relations: a new treaty, a revision of the
                            present treaty, and some side arrangement such as an exchange of notes.
                            Technically there are various considerations in handling these
                            approaches. As far as the spirit of the matter is concerned, Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> believes, as he had
                            said to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>,
                            that it would be best to have a new treaty, which would go through a
                            full democratic debate in the Diet and provide a permanent relationship
                            between Japan and the United States. This reflected the basic Japanese
                            attitude toward the Security Treaty, he concluded, and he then asked for
                            the Secretary’s opinion and comment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that the present Security Treaty
                            had been negotiated with himself as negotiator. He takes some
                            satisfaction in the fact that it has served well the purposes for which
                            it was designed under the conditions then obtaining. As the father of
                            the Treaty, however, he was not so devoted to it that he would be
                            unwilling to consider changing it, assuming something better would take
                            its place. Of course, he said, it had never been designed to be a
                            permanent and perpetual formula for the regulation of our security
                            arrangements. The Treaty itself stated that it was a “provisional”
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>He thought, the Secretary said, that the United States was quite prepared
                            to accept the view of the Foreign Minister that in the period, now <pb
                                n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0106"/>nine years, since the Treaty was
                            negotiated the situation had changed. It had changed along the lines
                            forecast by the Treaty, the preamble of which indicated that Japan would
                            increasingly assume the responsibility for its own defense against
                            direct and indirect aggression. He did not want to say that the United
                            States considers that what Japan has done has been adequate, but he
                            recognized the limitations of budget which Japan, like others, faces. As
                            the Prime Minister had said, financial considerations place a ceiling on
                            Japan’s military strength.</p>
                        <p>But he wanted to add, the Secretary continued, that even if Japan had
                            done the maximum which might have been expected, he did not believe that
                            in world conditions today any single nation, including the United
                            States, could feel secure without interdependence and unity with the
                            other free nations. We had hoped at the time the Treaty was made, we
                            have hoped since and we hope today that there may be some disarmament or
                            limitation of arms, measures which would diminish the threat now so
                            great. In order to be secure we must stand together, since this has not
                            yet happened and is not in prospect.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister had said that matter concerning the world situation
                            would also come out during the conversation, the Secretary went on. He
                            said that the most disturbing basic fact in the international situation
                            is the stubborn unwillingness of the Soviet Union to do anything which
                            might lead to a reduction in armaments or effectively eliminate nuclear
                            weapons. The Soviet Union concentrates its propaganda on the single item
                            of discontinuing nuclear tests, but this is not a measure which would
                            affect the production or limitation of armaments. The United States, on
                            the other hand, with its Western Allies, has sought the cessation of the
                            use of fissionable materials for weapons and the siphoning off of
                            weapons stocks to peaceful stocks to diminish the threat, but the Soviet
                            Union rejects this.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, he continued, the Soviet Union increasingly threatens the
                            use of nuclear weapons and missiles. They boast, falsely, that those
                            threats force other countries to bow to their will. That occurred during
                            the Suez crisis, later on in Syria, and at the time of the threat in
                            Lebanon. The latest letter from Khrushchev to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName><note n="1" xml:id="d26fn1"
                                >An unofficial translation of Premier Khrushchev’s letter to the
                                President, September 7, and the President’s reply, September 12, are
                                printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                September 29, 1958, pp. 498–503.</note> contains a veiled threat to
                            use nuclear weapons to destroy navies. He believed, the Secretary said,
                            although it was a surmise, that in the present trouble in the Formosa
                            area the Soviet Union told the Chinese Communists that the United States
                            was frightened of Soviet nuclear and missile power and that we gave in
                            in Syria and Lebanon (which is utterly false). The Chinese Communists
                            now use the threat of force to see if we are <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                                facs="0107"/>frightened by the nuclear power which the Soviet Union
                            says it will use to aid the Chinese Communists. In the face of that
                            Soviet power and their apparent willingness to threaten its use to
                            impose their will, there is no alternative for the free non-communist
                            nations but to unite their strength. No one, without catastrophic
                            consequences on the budget and on our free way of life, could maintain
                            the deterrent power needed to be effective against this intimidating
                            threat.</p>
                        <p>So I believe, the Secretary went on, that any nation which wants to
                            remain master of its own destiny and not subject to intimidation needs
                            security relations with others, so that a single pool of power to which
                            each contributes can in total be pledged to protect all, and sufficient
                            deterrent power can be maintained at a cost which is not prohibitive.
                            And so, he said, the United States believes that we still need a
                            dependable Security Treaty to govern relations between Japan and the
                            United States, assuming that Japan wants to retain genuine independence
                            and remain master of its own destiny.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these considerations, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            continued, he was happy that the Japanese Government wanted to continue
                            mutual security relations with the United States, and that the question
                            presented by the Foreign Minister was not whether, but how, these
                            relations would evolve. He had mentioned three alternatives, a new
                            treaty, a modification, or side arrangements, presumably under the
                            present treaty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> had
                            indicated that the preference of his Government was for the first
                            choice, a fresh, new treaty. The United States is quite prepared to
                            accept [that] in principle, the Secretary said, with the possibility of
                            reserving the other alternatives to fall back upon if serious difficulty
                            is encountered in reaching a new treaty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> then said that he
                            would like to go further into the subject of the relations between the
                            Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists, but since China was on the
                            agenda for tomorrow, he would wait until then.</p>
                        <p>He was happy, he continued, to note the willingness of the United States
                            Government to take up the problem of modifying or otherwise changing our
                            security relations to put them on a stronger basis. Except for the
                            communists and other members of the left wing, there are no Japanese who
                            favor abolition of the Security Treaty in its present or any other form.
                            The people favor continuance of the relations between the two countries.
                            To place our security relations on a very desirable firmer basis,
                            however, the present security arrangements must be made to conform
                            better to the sentiment of the Japanese public, for it is from there
                            that support must come. So the problem or proposition is how to build a
                            structure of security arrangements which would appropriately reflect <pb
                                n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0108"/>the national sentiment of Japan.
                            There would be various ways to arrive at arrangements or a treaty
                            satisfactory to both sides.</p>
                        <p>One point, the Foreign Minister continued, was that the obligation of the
                            United States to defend Japan was not spelled out in the present treaty.
                            In the light of the development of the Self Defense Forces, on the other
                            hand, internal problems (regarding which the present treaty says the
                            United States will assist) should naturally be the province of the Self
                            Defense Forces. Another point is the public feeling that Japan should on
                            its part cooperate with the United States in certain defense
                            responsibilities within the limitations of the Constitution.
                            Unfortunately, because of constitutional limitations, Japan’s
                            contribution might not come up to the expectations of the United States,
                            and the manner of the contribution might not be fully satisfactory, but
                            the limitations should be recognized. So far as military operations are
                            concerned, it would not be possible for Japan to send its forces outside
                            of Japan for cooperation in United States defense operations. That
                            function could be carried out only in the limits of the Japan area, of
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary interrupted to note that two terms had been used, “Japan
                            area” and “Japan”. He asked for clarification of that point. Mr.
                                <persName>Shimanouchi</persName> replied that the constitutional
                            limitations applied to the territorial limits of Japan. The Secretary
                            wondered whether “Japan area” meant the “area in and about Japan”, or
                            the technical geographic limits of Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> answered that he had meant “within the
                            territorial limits of Japan”. He would add, in clarification, however,
                            that Japan claimed 3-mile territorial waters as the territorial limits.
                            Submarines, ships and airplanes, however, could be used beyond those
                            limits for convoy duty.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, said the Foreign Minister, naturally in the event of armed
                            aggression Japan would provide the necessary base and operations
                            facilities in Japan. In the event of armed or aggressive action against
                            the United States or United States forces outside Japan, the present
                            arrangement would of course continue for logistic and other facilities
                            for United States forces. Naturally Japan was fully ready to cooperate,
                            but desired consultation on such matters. To clarify, he said, when
                            Japan was used as an operational base, it was desired that the Japanese
                            Government be consulted, but when it was used for logistics or supplies
                            the present basis was satisfactory. But in the latter case also, he
                            added, he would like to have spelled out in the treaty that the Japanese
                            Government would be consulted on questions of the deployment, armament,
                            weapons and equipment used by the United States forces. What gives the
                            impression that the present treaty is unilateral, he said, is that these
                            specific things are not spelled out in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>As you well know, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> went
                            on, there is a great sensitivity in Japan regarding the introduction of
                            nuclear weapons into Japan, not <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0109"
                            />limited to the communists but shared by other segments of the
                            population. The bringing in of nuclear weapons is a point of
                            considerable debate and concern in Japan. If the matters of deployment
                            and equipment (including all types of weapons) were included in the
                            treaty as matters for consultation, this would quell any misapprehension
                            of the Japanese people.</p>
                        <p>Another point, continued the Foreign Minister, undesirable at present
                            from the point of view of Japan, is that no date of termination is
                            specified in the Security Treaty. Some segments of the population feel
                            that this puts Japan in a position subservient to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Thus, Mr. Secretary, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName>, I have summarized the points uppermost in the
                            minds of the Japanese people. Agreement is needed which will be squarely
                            supported by the people. The question is “How?” By a new treaty, or by
                            another form? These are technical points for study. The Prime Minister’s
                            thinking, as I have indicated, is that, if it is technically feasible,
                            the best approach would be a new treaty which would be submitted to the
                            Diet for full debate. Diet approval of such a treaty would strengthen
                            ties with the United States. Once the Diet had approved the treaty, this
                            would end all, or substantially all, of the debate in Japan and remove
                            various causes for dissatisfaction, since the situation would have been
                            clarified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked the Foreign Minister for his presentation and for
                            the indication of the way in which the mind of his government worked on
                            this subject. I doubt, he said, that it would be wise to attempt now to
                            comment in detail on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                            >Fujiyama</persName>’s observations. He would have to give the matter
                            more thought and study, and would consult with his military advisers.
                            The Foreign Minister should also bear in mind that we were accountable
                            to our Congress in the same way that he was to the Diet. A new treaty or
                            a revision of the present treaty would require the consent of the Senate
                            for ratification.</p>
                        <p>The only comment he would permit himself, the Secretary continued, was
                            that some of those concerned understood that questions regarding
                            consultation could be expressed more usefully under the treaty rather
                            than as part of the treaty, as was the case with our other allies such
                            as the United Kingdom. Of course, the basic problem we would have to
                            weigh is what the Foreign Minister refers to as the constitutional
                            limitations in Japan. As the result of a treaty of the kind which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> envisaged, it might
                            perhaps be considered one-sided, in the sense that the United States
                            would be committed to the defense of Japan, but Japan would not be
                            committed to the defense of the United States. He referred, the
                            Secretary said, regarding commitment for the defense of the United
                            States, to the fact that the armed forces of Japan would not be
                            available for use outside the Japan area. We do recognize, on the other
                            hand, the substantial value of the suggestion made by the Foreign
                            Minister that <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0110"/>Japanese logistic
                            support and facilities would be made available to the United States even
                            though Japanese armed forces could not be used with the same geographic
                            freedom as the United States forces.</p>
                        <p>He would like to suggest to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName>, the Secretary went on, a practical way to
                            progress. We would take steps which the Secretary would outline: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The executive branch of the Government would study with care
                                    the preliminary observations which the Foreign Minister had
                                    made. The Department of State would consult with the Department
                                    of Defense.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We would consult, on a highly confidential basis, a small
                                    number–4 or 5–of the members of the United States Senate
                                    concerned with this problem, to see if they think the Senate
                                    would in principle go along with a new treaty or revision, which
                                    for practical reasons amount to the same thing, since both would
                                    have to go to the Senate.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>If these preliminary explorations in the executive branch and
                                    the Senate indicate a good hope that we can proceed along this
                                    new line, we would ask our representatives, presumably under
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>’s
                                    leadership, to commence actual discussions with reference to a
                                    new treaty, in the hope that something could be arrived at by
                                    the first of the year when the Senate reassembles. We would do
                                    our best to conclude the preliminary work by October 1, so that
                                    if the explorations indicated it was desirable to proceed we
                                    could proceed on or after October 1.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I would like to say, the Secretary continued, that it would be desirable
                            to have no publicity at this stage. It might be premature and give
                            expectations prematurely before it was ascertained whether it was
                            possible to realize them. Our Senators are particularly sensitive about
                            reading in the papers of these matters before they hear from us that
                            they are being studied.</p>
                        <p>I would like to say, Mr. Minister, continued the Secretary, in this
                            connection, that the position I have indicated does bear testimony to
                            the great confidence we place in the Japanese Government and leaders and
                            in Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, and to
                            the confidence and faith in the desire of the Japanese nation as a whole
                            to maintain its independent existence and its free and equal
                            relationship with the other free nations of the world, particularly the
                            United States. We have a treaty now which gives us broad continuing
                            rights, but it is not in the nature of the kind of nation that we are to
                            rest only upon legal treaty rights. We believe that more important than
                            that is to rest upon good will and the sense of common destiny which
                            links our two nations together. From a purely legalistic, juridical
                            standpoint, what the Foreign Minister proposes would involve
                            considerable sacrifice on the part of the United States. We have a
                            treaty duly ratified by the Japanese Government, and approved by the
                            Diet, containing broad rights as long as we think it necessary to have
                            them. We are asked to give these up in favor of a treaty which would
                            impose upon us much heavier obligations without any corresponding
                            advantages, <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>so far as they lie in
                            the treaty language. We are prepared to consider that, assuming that the
                            Senate is also willing, because we consider this the enlightened way in
                            which nations which respect each other act toward each other. Frankly,
                            our expectation and willingness in this respect are based on our
                            understanding and appreciation that this will lead to increased
                            spiritual ties with the Japanese nation, which are more important than
                            strictly material ties. That is all, the Secretary concluded, that he
                            cared to say on this subject at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> answered that he fully
                            concurred in the Secretary’s sentiments. Certainly, the Japanese realize
                            that strengthening ties to share a common destiny is an important
                            element in our relationship. As the Secretary said, the United States’
                            sacrifice involved might mean that what was now unilateral from the
                            Japanese point of view might become unilateral from the American point
                            of view. But the strengthening of spiritual ties and relations and the
                            knowing of the Secretary’s thoughts would impose a greater
                            responsibility on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>Since time was short, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            said, he would now go on to other items. First, Okinawa. He wanted to
                            express the appreciation of himself and his Government to the Secretary
                            for the efforts of the United States to settle the land problem which
                            has now been satisfactorily concluded. This has already been reflected
                            in actions in Okinawa and was a very wise decision. Of course, the
                            Foreign Minister hoped Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> would understand
                            that the problems and welfare of the 800,000 people in Okinawa were
                            close to the minds and hearts of the 90 million people of Japan. He did
                            not intend to bring up the subject of restoration of administrative
                            rights in Okinawa. Because the hopes and aspirations of the people of
                            Okinawa are shared by the people of Japan, however, it may be necessary
                            for Japan to take up some of these problems. At least Japan cannot
                            ignore them. That would be impossible. So, from time to time, the
                            Japanese Government may bring up certain matters with the hope and
                            purpose of maintaining stability and tranquility. Even before the war,
                            Okinawa, as part of the administrative territory of Japan, was a
                            financial drag on Japan. Therefore, the Japanese were naturally
                            cognizant of the economic aspects of the Okinawa problem. It would
                            sometimes be necessary for Japan to extend economic aid to maintain the
                            stability and livelihood of the people in Okinawa. Only thus could we
                            prevent unrest and the rise of extremists and other undesirable
                            elements. From that point of view he would like to strengthen the
                            economic relations between Okinawa and Japan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> expected that certain things
                            would arise in the future, and when and if they did, he would take them
                            up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>.
                            He hoped the Secretary would understand that sentiment required Japan to
                            play a role in Okinawa. That was all he wished to say about Okinawa, but
                            he wanted to take this opportunity <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0112"
                            />to express the appreciation of his Government to Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> said that he would make one or two
                            comments. The United States had no desire to erect artificial barriers
                            to good relations between the people of Japan and the inhabitants of the
                            Ryukyus. He was sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> would recognize that, for the sake of good
                            order, economic matters and the like would have to be coordinated with
                            the administrative authorities of the Ryukyus. We could not afford to
                            have a competitive or conflicting situation. Because of the need for
                            coordination with the administrative authorities, he hoped the Foreign
                            Minister would take these questions up with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> on an informal and
                            unpublicized basis, so that the public would not be aroused about
                            matters which still had to be coordinated with the administrative
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then referred to the Bonin Islands. As the Secretary
                            would recall, during the discussion on the Bonin Islands last year it
                            had been stated that repatriation could not be carried out. This had
                            been explained thoroughly by the Japanese Government to the League of
                            Bonin Islanders. They accept the fact that circumstances at present
                            prevent their return. Without abandoning their hope for future
                            repatriation, however, they would like to be compensated for the losses
                            suffered by reason of their evacuation. They had proposed a certain sum
                            of money as compensation. The Foreign Minister would like to have
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> discuss this
                            problem with the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the United States appreciates the acceptance
                            of the position against repatriation, which the United States Government
                            took reluctantly but for compelling reasons. We also appreciate the
                            spirit in which the Japanese Government explained this matter to the
                            Islanders and their understanding. Regarding the matter of compensation,
                            that thought had been expressed in the prior talks. We are prepared to
                            discuss this with the Japanese Government. The Secretary had heard
                            figures mentioned, however, which seemed to him somewhat beyond the
                            value of anything he thought had existed in the Bonins. But he was
                            prepared to talk about these matters.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the situation on the United States side
                            had been thoroughly explained by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>. The difference in
                            legislation between the two countries was understood. The question,
                            however, was one of the mental anguish of the Bonin Islanders, who hope
                            that some settlement can be made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> hoped that the Secretary understood that the
                            League was well meaning. It was constantly making anti-communist
                            efforts. Any compensation granted would be appreciated by them and by
                            the people of Japan in a manner which would increase good will toward
                            the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0113"/>
                        <p>After a brief discussion the Secretary and the Foreign Minister agreed
                            that negotiations on this subject would be conducted both in Tokyo and
                            in Washington on a parallel basis.<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">Japan had
                                accepted the U.S. decision that for the time being former Bonin
                                islanders could not return to their native soil but continued to
                                press for compensation totalling $12.5 million. The United States
                                was willing to compensate for the use of private land holdings as
                                valued at the time when the peace treaty went into effect (April 28,
                                1952), plus 5 percent per annum interest, approximately $5 million.
                                Eventually the two governments agreed on $6 million. (Position

                        <p>Lastly, said the Foreign Minister, he would like to discuss the question
                            of war criminals. The fact that all B and C Class war criminals had been
                            paroled was very much appreciated by the Japanese Government. If the
                            United States formula were followed, however, two years would elapse
                            before their parole could be terminated. It was the desire of the
                            Japanese Government to have parole terminated for these 80 or so men at
                            about the same time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we have examined this matter and that we can
                            waive the balance of the two-year parole requirement by the beginning of
                            next year, and this would liquidate the entire matter.<note n="3"

                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the Secretary, and stated that before the
                            meeting broke up he would like to ask whether agreement could be reached
                            before the negotiation of a new Security Treaty regarding the question
                            of consultation on the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. This
                            might be discussed in the Security Committee in Tokyo, with an
                            indication that the Japanese Government would be consulted. Mr.

                            give it consideration before replying. The Foreign Minister said that he
                            did not expect a reply here, but asked that the Secretary consider
                            taking the matter up in the Security Committee.</p>

                                    attempts to renegotiate the Administrative Agreement should be
                                    forestalled until we have had an opportunity to review whether
                                    this would be in our interest. Our tentative thinking is to
                                    leave agreement intact, with side agreement reciting that
                                    present references in Administrative Agreement should henceforth
                                    be read as references to Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty.
                                    If further changes are in your opinion necessary, please advise
                                    soonest as any revision of Administrative Agreement should be

                            and (b) facilitating presentation annual report to Congress on status of

                            <item>At opening of our discussion, I informed <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that following the Secretary’s
                                meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>, <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> request to replace Security Treaty
                                with mutual treaty had been discussed with Executive branch and
                                confidentially with certain key Congressional leaders. Request for
                                new treaty raises a serious problem for US since US is asked to give
                                up broad continuing rights it now has by virtue of present treaty
                                for new treaty which would impose upon US heavy obligation insofar
                                as terms of a new treaty are concerned. Nevertheless, US prepared to
                                accede to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s request and
                                discuss with Japanese replacing present treaty with mutual treaty.
                                This decision was taken primarily due to importance US places in
                                closest possible relations with Japanese Government and to its
                                confidence in <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s desire for

                                />US on basis of durable and firm treaty relationship. I pointed out
                                that new treaty and security arrangements raise number of difficult
                                problems for US. We therefore intended from very outset to lay all
                                our cards on table and indicated frankly general limits and bounds
                                within which we must work if we are to find solution which US could
                                live with.</item>

                                            27</ref>.</note> pointing out that draft had been
                                    prepared in effort to meet various suggestions raised previously
                                    with US by <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and
                                        <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> in earlier
                                    talks. I explained treaty was also drafted to reflect broad
                                    community of interests and interdependence between Japan and US
                                    not only in field of security but in economic and other
                                    respects.</p>
                                <p>I then carefully reviewed each article in draft treaty, drawing
                                    upon commentary prepared by Department,<note n="4"
                                        xml:id="d31fn4">Not found.</note> and stressing particularly
                                    our views with respect Articles V, VI, and X. Re Article V, I
                                    said words “territories or areas under the administrative
                                    control” included 4 main islands of Japan, small islands now
                                    under Japanese control, Article III peace treaty islands now
                                    under US administrative control and islands in Pacific
                                    administered by US. Language of treaty also would require no
                                    amendment if northern islands are restored to Japanese control
                                    by <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or at such time as
                                    Article III peace treaty islands may be returned to Japanese
                                    administration.</p>
                                <p>However, I made clear our draft has no effect on rights of US
                                    under Article III of peace treaty. I also explained our
                                    interpretation that term, “in accordance with constitutional
                                    process”, means Japan would not be obligated send its forces
                                    outside Japan if constitution interpreted to prohibit such use
                                    of Japanese forces.</p>
                                <p>Re Article VI, I stressed our deep desire present administrative
                                    agreement in effect although we prepared to take necessary
                                    technical steps to cure references in agreement to present
                                    security treaty. With such technical steps, administrative
                                    agreement would not in our view appear one-sided since
                                    inequalities in present arrangements which have been criticized
                                    in Japan seem to stem from treaty and not administrative
                                    agreement. I pointed out that if US is to commit itself to
                                    responsibility for sharing Japanese defense, we would obviously
                                    need provisions covering facilities, status of forces
                                    arrangements, etc. and that our new draft mutual treaty together
                                    with present administrative agreement would seem to be far best
                                    arrangement.</p>
                                <p>Re Article X, I recalled that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> in previous conversations had mentioned
                                    desire to have treaty fixed for certain period, such as 10
                                    years, following which it could be terminated by one year’s
                                    notice. <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0124"/>Article X had
                                    been drafted to take his views into account with which we

                            <item><p>I next discussed proposed formula<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5"

                                    in response <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> request for
                                    consultation on introduction of nuclear and operational use of
                                    US bases in emergency. I recalled <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName>’s statements to Secretary on September
                                    11 in which he mentioned that, in event of aggression against
                                    Japan area, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would provide
                                    necessary operational bases in Japan and that, in event
                                    aggression against US outside Japan, present logistic use of US
                                    bases for support of US forces would continue. I pointed out
                                    that we attach great importance to use of facilities in Japan to
                                    meet Communist aggression outside Japan area against other free
                                    Asian nations. On basis of <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName>’s assurances regarding use of logistic
                                    and other facilities, we had developed formula providing for
                                    joint consultation on introduction nuclears and operational use
                                    Japanese bases as requested by <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName>. I explained that first operative
                                    clause in formula on “deployment of US forces and equipment into
                                    bases in Japan” referred specifically to introduction of
                                    nuclears [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                        declassified</hi>]. On second aspect of formula I stressed
                                    that it was our understanding that joint consultation formula
                                    applied to operational use of US bases and that formula would
                                    not create barrier for use of these facilities for logistic
                                    purposes.</p>
                                <p>I then explained why it was not practicable to include formula in
                                    treaty and suggested it be recorded otherwise either through
                                    exchange of notes or agreed minute, as Japanese preferred,
                                    either of which would be made public with treaty. I also
                                    indicated our desire that in due course our understanding on
                                    formula be confirmed by Japanese in some mutually agreeable
                                    way.</p>

                                    since exchange of notes was related to the peace treaty and not
                                    to security treaty it seemed quite clear that undertaking of

                                confidential minute public, it would be materially helpful to US to
                                work out some public formulation on this matter in which Japan would
                                refer to its past practice of not exercising such jurisdiction and
                                affirm that it would be Japanese policy to continue to do so in the
                                future.</item>

                                could be carefully studied by himself and Foreign Ministry. However,

                                discussion of press line, I emphasized need to conduct our

                                discussions very closely and keep them out of press, there is a
                                great danger of building up public inflexibility on key issues both
                                in Japan and US. This would make it most difficult for us to handle
                                negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                                whole-heartedly concurred. At <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                    >Kishi</persName>’s suggestion, we agreed that discussions would
                                be kept to very restricted number of people on both sides and, in
                                particular, that no mention would be made of fact we had presented
                                text draft treaty. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                                emphasized that it was of paramount importance to avoid any

                                when draft finally sees light of day it would be presented as
                                document hammered out together on basis of Japanese proposals rather
                                than based on a US draft.</item>

                            <item>Point 1. Japanese said “objectives” of treaty (as term is used in
                                Article six) were nowhere clearly set forth in treaty and that
                                Article six language “in furtherance of the objectives of this
                                treaty” could be subject to several interpretations, particularly
                                when read in conjunction with Article five and the formula on use of
                                US forces in Japan. They pointed out we appeared to have in mind
                                three related interpretations in our draft treaty when taken
                                together with the “formula” which everyone would read in
                                relationship to the treaty: (a) defense of Japan area; (b) defense
                                of US-administered territory in Pacific; (c) specific type of use by
                                US in certain circumstances of facilities in Japan in relation to
                                situations outside purview of Article five of treaty. (<hi

                                this triple concept, but asked for clarification, and clearly
                                implied that language of Article six carried apparent implication
                                that treaty itself limited use of US facilities to achieve
                                objectives of Article five (i.e., defense <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"

                                Pacific). If we had other aspects in mind, there would have to be
                                full understanding and agreement about them. There might be aspects
                                of this problem which could not usefully be formulated in official
                                documents. In such event it would still be important to have
                                agreement on how <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and US Govt

                                referred to commitment in Article five to “act” in accordance with
                                constitutional processes and asked what concrete measures Japan
                                would be expected to take in event of attack on US-administered
                                territory within treaty area, but outside of Japan area, short of
                                sending its forces overseas. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We

                                opportunity to point out that while an attack on Ryukyus or Bonins
                                would bring Article five of treaty into effect, Japan would not have
                                responsibility for planning or for contributing armed forces in
                                Ryukyus or Bonins for their defense while these areas under US

                                    agreement integral part of treaty, and thus either freeze it in
                                    its present form or require that its future amendment be subject
                                    to same ratification procedures as treaty itself. Their initial
                                    view was that present language appeared to do this and to be
                                    inconsistent with Article XXVIII of administrative agreement
                                    which permits amendment through executive action.</p>

                                whether taking technical steps to conform references to security
                                treaty in administrative agreement to new treaty would also include
                                deletion of references in administrative agreement to “rights”
                                conferred on US. They did not indicate any desire <pb n="98"
                                    xml:id="pg_98" facs="0128"/>to change main substance of
                                administrative agreement but did indicate that retention of

                                of notes only stating references to present security treaty applied
                                to new treaty, would be politically difficult. They did not appear
                                to be challenging basic substance of present agreement, but pointed
                                out Article six of draft treaty had no specific references to US
                                “right” to station forces in Japan, Whereas there are such
                                references in administrative agreement and these would seem to be
                                inconsistent with new treaty. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We

                            <item>Point 6. <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> officials asked
                                whether word “bases” was used deliberately in Article six and in
                                consultation formula, in place of present terminology in
                                administrative agreement, i.e., “facilities and areas”. They said
                                word “bases” had been deliberately avoided in present security
                                treaty and administrative agreement when negotiated since it was
                                considered to have very unfavorable connotations for Japanese
                                public. They also asked what was intended by language “use of
                                certain bases”, i.e., whether this was intended to give treaty
                                sanction to facilities and areas now used by US forces and thus
                                foreclose or make very difficult any adjustments in this base
                                system, or whether it was intended to imply that US would retain
                                bases after US forces were withdrawn. (<hi rend="italic"

                                necessary to fulfill treaty obligations, without specifically

                                outside of San Francisco. With respect <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"

                                in each specific case. They commented informally that notes also
                                appeared to refer specifically to hostilities flowing from North
                                Korean invasion of South Korea in 1950 and that therefore reference

                                logically referred only to hostilities arising out of broadening of

                            Secretary. I met secretly with <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> late November 26 at his request for further
                            discussion of new security treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> are determined to continue
                            negotiations and have not changed their intention to submit new treaty
                            to Diet during next regular session. However, experience with police
                            bill has taught them importance of marshaling public and party support
                            before government makes final decision. Obviously government cannot seek
                            such support except in broadest terms until we have had meeting of minds
                            on basic elements of new treaty. Therefore, he wished to discuss those
                            elements with me on highly confidential basis before there is publicly
                            announced negotiating session. Such session can be held when we know
                            that basic elements are agreed and when <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> has been able to inform party factions in more
                            concrete terms of scope and substance of treaty. I agreed.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> then said the most
                            critical point of the treaty revision for Japan is the treaty area. With
                            respect to US proposal that all US and Japanese ministered territories
                            in Pacific be included in treaty area, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said it was now clear that inclusion of US
                            island possessions in Pacific would raise major questions of
                            interpretation of Japanese constitution and would not be approved by
                            either Japanese public opinion or the Diet. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> had originally thought well of the idea of including
                            the Japanese home islands and Article III Peace Treaty islands (Ryukyus
                            and Bonins). However, as result of discussion within Conservative Party
                            as well as private discussions with principal newspaper editors and
                            other leaders of public opinion, it now seemed clear that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would be unable to obtain necessary
                            support for inclusion of Article III islands. This is not only because
                            their inclusion would place major weapon in hands of Socialists, as
                            explained further below, but also because of serious arguments advanced
                            within Liberal Democratic Party itself: <list>

                                <item>Some members of majority party as well as influential public
                                    figures, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said,
                                    feel that if Article III islands were to be included, then Japan
                                    should strongly insist upon return of administrative control of
                                    those islands to Japan. This they feel would be only way to
                                    overcome opposition to inclusion of Article III islands.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <persName

                                    we cannot return such administration at this time. They do not
                                    wish to be forced into raising this issue with us but feel that
                                    pressure within party and with the public would strongly
                                    increase if Japan were to propose inclusion of islands.</item>

                                    continued, there is also important element within Conservative
                                    Party, centering around such respected figures as Admirals
                                    Nomura and Hoshina and former Prime Minister Ashida, who are
                                    opposed to including Ryukyus and Bonins in treaty area not only
                                    because they do not desire administration over those islands to
                                    be returned. (Such persons favor continued American
                                    administration of Okinawa and are opposed to inclusion of
                                    Ryukyus and Bonins in treaty area because it might result in
                                    efforts to limit our ability to introduce nuclear weapons into
                                    Okinawa. Such leaders consider it essential for Japan’s security
                                    that US nuclear capability in Article III islands be not limited
                                    and they oppose their inclusion in treaty area because they do
                                    not want to see that question raised.)</item>

                                <item>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said,
                                    it is <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> assessment that
                                    Socialist opposition arguments against inclusion of Ryukyus and
                                    Bonins could win widespread popular support. Their principal
                                    argument is that if those islands were included, this would,
                                    contrary to constitution, in effect bring Japan into
                                    multilateral security treaty with Republic of China, <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the Philippines, etcetera,
                                    (because Ryukyus and Bonins are covered by our treaties with
                                    those countries) and that Japan would be committed to
                                    hostilities to which any of those treaties applicable. For
                                    example, <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0132"/>if US and
                                    Nationalist China became engaged in hostilities with Communist
                                    China over Quemoy and Matsu the US would probably be obliged to
                                    use Okinawa as a base to attack Communist forces. This might
                                    lead to an attack on Okinawa by Communist China which, by the
                                    terms of the new treaty, would bring Japan into the conflict if
                                    Article III islands are included in treaty area.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>He was fully aware, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said,
                            that there are weighty arguments in favor of inclusion of Article III
                            islands, not least of which from point of view of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is desire of Okinawans themselves who
                            have petitioned <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in this respect. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and he had come to
                            conclusion that it would be wiser both from Japanese and American
                            viewpoint to limit treaty area to the Japan home islands and he wanted
                            you to know reasons and hoped earnestly this would be sympathetically
                            and urgently considered in Washington.</p>
                        <p>I am cabling you personally about this matter not only because <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> asked me to do so but also
                            because the treaty area is the key to the entire problem and until we
                            reach agreement on the area it is not possible to move forward. We in
                            the Embassy have been considering this problem very seriously since we
                            received Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s (<gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>) message 060602Z November<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d35fn1">Not found.</note> which in its paragraph
                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> strongly recommended excluding the
                            Article III islands from the treaty area. In light of developments here
                            since that time I strongly concur with Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s recommendation and urge that we
                            limit the area to the Japanese-administered islands on the assumption
                            that we get a satisfactory agreement with the Japanese regarding the
                            other important points, including the use of bases, the formula on
                            consultation and the administrative agreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he would like to meet
                            with me again secretly about the middle of next week to get our reaction
                            to this problem. If you in Washington agree to a treaty area which
                            should include only Japanese-administered territories I would not inform
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> at this juncture that
                            we had agreed but would say to him that although limited treaty area
                            raised serious problems, I thought there was a fair chance of agreeing
                            to such a limited treaty area if, but only if, we could reach
                            satisfactory agreement on other matters including bases, the
                            consultation formula and the administrative agreement. I would then
                            concentrate on these matters. (We have indication that Japanese believe
                            administrative agreement will have to be amended to conform it to text
                            and spirit of new treaty but that they do not seem to have in mind basic
                            change.)</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> did not go into
                            details on consultation formula, he made it clear that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and he fully accept basic
                            principle that US <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0133"/>use of bases
                            in Japan is most important contribution Japan can make to give required
                            element of mutuality to new treaty. While Japanese would naturally
                            expect us to continue to keep in close touch with them, as we are now
                            doing, they agree with principle that consultation formula should be
                            confined to introduction of nuclears and military operations outside of
                            Japan. Consequently, I have no reason to expect any substantive
                            difficulties over this most important element from our viewpoint.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> voiced preference for
                            having consultation formula laid down in form of protocol forming
                            integral part of treaty, but I explained to him that it is not our
                            practice to submit such understandings for congressional ratification
                            although there would of course be no objection whatever to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> submitting formula to Diet together
                            with treaty document itself, perhaps in form of exchange of notes.</p>
                        <p>On private, confidential and personal basis, Foreign Office official
                            showed member of my staff a draft on consultation which he said
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> was considering. It
                            read: “Major changes in the disposition of US forces (including their
                            equipment) in Japan and the use of facilities and areas within Japan as
                            the bases of military operations for purposes other than the defense of
                            Japan shall be effected upon prior consultation with the Government of
                            Japan”. Foreign Office official emphasized that while as at present they
                            would expect to be informed of withdrawal of US forces from Japan,
                            “consultation” would not be expected or required under formula. There
                            thus appears to be no substantive difference at this juncture over
                            consultation formula although in this respect, as well as in others, we
                            may later have some hard negotiating.</p>

                        <p>Major substantive difficulty in talks thus concerns the treaty area. As I
                            have indicated in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 948<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">See <ref target="#d43fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    43</ref>.</note> (when there still seemed possibility of treaty
                            area including Article III islands), inclusion of US-administered
                            territories in treaty area does not seem essential to our purposes. As I
                            understand it, our basic and overriding interest lies in creation of
                            reasonably dependable and long-term military security arrangement
                            entered into voluntarily by Japan which will: Align Japan with us and
                            free world in military security field; which will give us use of
                            Japanese logistic facilities and bases in peace-time thus saving us
                            literally hundreds of millions of dollars; and which will at same time
                            give us reasonable expectation of use of bases for logistic support if
                            we become involved in hostilities in the Far East in which Japan is not
                            involved, with possibility of also using them operationally. These
                            objectives can be accomplished regardless of whether Article III islands
                            are in treaty area. As matter of fact, given the situation here and
                            question of continued administration <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104"
                                facs="0134"/>of Article III islands etc., I now believe that there
                            is very substantial advantage to us if they are not so included.
                            (Incidentally the ChiNats and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will
                            also be much happier if Ryukyus are not included.) I therefore strongly
                            recommend that we be prepared to have treaty area confined to Japanese
                            home islands.</p>

                                proposed changes in the State–Defense approved draft wording of a

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff note that this change would limit the
                                area covered by the agreed draft to only the home islands of Japan
                                and the Ryukyus and the Bonin-Volcanos. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                further note that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                    >MacArthur</persName> bases his proposed change on the
                                expectation that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                    >Kishi</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName

                                Bonins. He believes satisfaction of this anticipated request will
                                reduce confusion in the Japanese public mind and help <persName

                                />the Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted that the Ambassador accounts
                                for the failure on the part of the Japanese as yet to have made this
                                request, to their fear that it might not be granted.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree that, in developing a U.S.
                                position for negotiations, it is wise to consider all possible
                                positions of the other side. It does not follow in this case,
                                however, that the U.S. position should be changed to conform to this
                                new prediction of the Japanese position. Indeed, Japanese reluctance
                                to accept the responsibility attendant upon mutuality was duly
                                considered in setting forth the present wording that either party
                                will act “in accordance with its constitutional provisions and
                                processes”; this in effect would relieve Japan of the necessity of
                                taking anything but passive action to defend any of the territory
                                covered by the treaty. Passive Japanese support in the defense of
                                the Ryukyus, Bonins and Volcanos would be a foregone conclusion,
                                hence the United States would gain nothing by the inclusion in the
                                Treaty of these islands per se. Such an inclusion would, on the
                                other hand, be useful to the Japanese as a political lever toward
                                reestablishment of Japanese administrative control over the
                                islands.</item>

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are therefore opposed to the proposed
                                change in the wording to Article V of the agreed draft, and while
                                understanding and appreciating the reasons persuading the Ambassador
                                to suggest it, recommend that the United States adhere to the
                                position that a mutual treaty should involve the application of
                                whatever commitments the Japanese may undertake to U.S. as well as
                                Japanese “territories and areas”. The phrase “in accordance with its
                                constitutional provisions and processes” should be recognized as
                                providing the necessary differences to accommodate Japanese
                                political and physical limitations. If it becomes impossible to
                                include any U.S. sovereign territory, then the Article III peace
                                treaty islands should not be included in Japanese responsibility for
                                so long as the U.S. retains administrative, legislative and
                                jurisdictional control over them.</item>

                        <p>Understand Japanese desire to limit treaty area in new Security Treaty to
                            Japan home islands but this proposal raises problems for us. Agreeable
                            to deletion of Article 3 Islands from treaty area. However, absence of
                            any territory other than Japanese in treaty area makes treaty
                            susceptible to criticism, particularly from Congressional and public
                            circles, for lack of mutuality of type included in our other treaty
                            arrangements in Far Eastern area. More specifically, failure to include
                            any US sovereign territory in treaty area may be interpreted as move by
                            Japan toward non-involvement in event US territorial interests under
                            direct attack. This might result in possible non-availability of US
                            bases and forces stationed in Japan for active defense of these areas
                            except as US forces are pulled out from Japan and operate from other
                            Pacific bases.</p>
                        <p>Under present conditions, possibility cannot be excluded of direct Commie
                            attack on US Pacific territories bypassing Japan. In return for treaty
                            commitment covering defense of Japan, we were not anticipating at this
                            time Japanese participation in military actions outside Japan area in
                            defense of such US territory. By inclusion of US Pacific territory in
                            Treaty area, however, we looked for indication of Japanese concern over
                            defense of US territorial interests at least to extent of agreeing 1) to
                            our use of US bases and forces in Japan to assist in defending against
                            attacks on these areas and 2) to Japanese taking appropriate military
                            actions within Japan area. E.g., in event US territories attacked,
                            Japanese might <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0137"/>for example
                            attack Soviet aircraft headed to or from US territory and overflying

                                >Kishi</persName> yesterday afternoon (December 6) to discuss
                            Security Treaty revision. (Only Wada was present to interpret.) I said
                            that Treaty revision seemed now to have become entangled not only with
                            domestic political situation and conflict between conservatives and
                            socialists but also in intra-party dispute within <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>. I felt it was important to assess
                            where we stood in order to decide how best to proceed and therefore I
                            wanted his estimate of situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he wanted to discuss
                            this matter very frankly with me, particularly as it related to
                            intra-party situation within the <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>. He
                            then said that the unhappy outcome of the attempt to revise the police
                            law had caused a wave of factionalism within the <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss>. This was probably the most unfortunate result of the
                            police law affair. When <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> liaison committee had met December 4 to
                            discuss Security Treaty there had been no agreement reached as to how to
                            proceed. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said it was quite
                            clear that certain anti-main-stream factions, having in mind forthcoming
                            election next year for <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> presidency,
                            were using revision of Security Treaty in connection with factional
                            maneuvering within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Discussing attitude of anti-main-stream factions on treaty revision,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said Miki–Matsumura
                            faction was opposed to treaty revision if it would strengthen and make
                            closer Japanese military relations with US. On other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_YS2"
                                >Yoshida</persName> group indicated it was opposed to treaty
                            revision unless Japan’s military and security ties with US would be
                            strengthened thereby. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said
                            that views of <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> group as to objective of
                            revising Security Treaty were similar to views of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, his brother <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and mainstream in that they all
                            wanted revision of Security Treaty to make security relations between
                            Japan and U.S. even closer than they had been before. Specifically,
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> group wished to have Ryukyus and
                            Bonins included in treaty area, whereas Miki–Matsumura group were
                            strongly opposed. However Miki–Matsumura group were minority in <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> and their views in themselves would not
                            be decisive.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0139"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said in light of factional
                            situation within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> he doubted that
                            there could be unified position on Security Treaty on part of
                            Conservative party until after elections for presidency of <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> went on to say that while his 2-year mandate as
                            president did not expire until March, he felt it was very important that
                            present uncertainties as to future leadership of <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss> be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore he believed
                            elections for <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> presidency should be
                            held in January at regular annual meeting of party convention now
                            tentatively scheduled for about January 17. If elections were held in
                            January, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> felt it was certain
                            he would be reelected and quite possibly nobody would run against him.
                            On other hand if elections were postponed till March he believed
                            factional maneuvering within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> would
                            increase, with strong possibility that anti-mainstream might agree to
                            back Ishii against him. Furthermore delaying presidential election till
                            March would have very unsettling and adverse effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> campaign for important Upper House
                            election scheduled for beginning of June. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> said he believed chances were at present 80% in
                            favor of elections for presidency of <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>
                            in January.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that insofar as public
                            opinion relating to revision of Security Treaty is concerned, general
                            public is groping because it is not certain precisely what revision of
                            treaty will mean. He had been confidentially in touch with certain
                            leaders of public opinion such as political commentators, et cetera, and
                            they were all generally in favor of treaty revision, particularly if
                            treaty area were confined to Japanese-administered islands. He had also
                            been privately in touch with <persName corresp="#p_NS6"
                                >Nishio</persName> (right wing) Socialist faction and had received
                            most confidential indications that <persName corresp="#p_NS6"
                                >Nishio</persName> group would probably not oppose treaty revision
                            if Ryukyus and Bonins were not included and if revision followed general
                            lines which were envisaged and did not increase chances of Japan
                            becoming involved in war. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            said recent interventions of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                            and Soviets against treaty revision had definitely influenced <persName
                                corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> group, which is not desirous of
                            giving impression they were Communist stooges. This, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> believed, was one important reason
                                <persName corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> group would not oppose
                            sensible revision of treaty. Furthermore, Japanese public opinion in
                            general had reacted adversely to <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> and Soviet blasts against treaty revision.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> how he thought we
                            should proceed in light of his estimate of situation, saying that until
                            Conservatives were solidly behind treaty I had some doubts as to wisdom
                            of proceeding with publicly announced meetings between <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> and myself, although I would,
                            of course, be glad to meet privately with them whenever convenient.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied he thought we should
                            continue to meet secretly to discuss detailed aspects of treaty
                            revision. In addition to these confidential discussions [<gloss

                            from my trip to Hiroshima and Shikoku, for me to have relatively short
                            publicly announced meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FA8"

                            have to be of great lengths but would serve notice that treaty
                            discussions had not been abandoned. We would thereafter continue to
                            exchange views and work confidentially, together with perhaps occasional
                            publicly announced meetings, if this seemed useful, until meeting <gloss

                            anticipated president of <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> for next
                            two years would be elected. Once <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>
                            president had been elected, he felt factional maneuvering with respect
                            to Security Treaty revision would vanish and he would be able to move
                            forward with solid support of Conservative party.</p>
                        <p>With respect to treaty area, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            believed majority of <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leadership
                            might end up by favoring inclusion in treaty area of Ryukyus and Bonins
                            despite strong opposition of Miki–Matsumura. However, this was
                            speculative and he emphasized that treaty area was most important single
                            aspect of entire treaty revision problem insofar as Japanese were
                            concerned. The final decision would depend not only on views of
                            different factions within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> but also
                            on his final assessment to public opinion which admittedly was at
                            present strongly against inclusion of Ryukyus and Bonins.</p>

                            opened by saying he wished to outline to me political situation within
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> Conservative Party as it related
                            to our discussions. Since our last meeting he had number of
                            consultations with party leaders and these had convinced him of three
                            things: (a) None of factional leaders presently making trouble over
                            treaty revision is really opposed to new security treaty. Present
                            differences within party stem essentially from considerations of
                            intra-party politics; (b) this squabbling will disappear and unity on
                            treaty question will be quickly restored once election for party
                            presidency is out of way; (c) anti-mainstream elements in party are not
                            really trying to oust <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> from
                            direction of party but are gunning for certain other personalities in
                            party directorate (i.e., <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS5">Kawashima</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName>). Even <persName corresp="#p_YS2"
                                >Yoshida</persName>, whom <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> had recently seen, had voiced to him private
                            opinion that there is no alternative to <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> at
                            present time. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said in
                            light of foregoing it is essential that elections for party president be
                            got out of way at earliest possible time, and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> agrees with him on this. Present indications are
                            that those elections will take place in <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss> convention about January 18 rather than in March,
                            although final decision has not yet been taken. Meanwhile <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> was continuing to conduct
                            active public relations program, including large number personal
                            contacts with public opinion leaders, to dispel misunderstandings about
                            treaty negotiations and unify public opinion. However, it was clear
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said that until
                            Conservative Party itself is unified there <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112"
                                facs="0142"/>can be no negotiations on basic substantive questions
                            such as treaty area, although there were one or two other matters that
                            could be talked about. I agree that treaty negotiations on basic issues
                            would be fruitless unless Conservative Party gives strong and unified
                            support.</p>
                        <p>He said one aspect of treaty revision problem which had been studied very
                            carefully by Japanese legal experts was administrative agreement. They
                            had come to conclusion that administrative agreement derives from
                            present security treaty and is based upon it, so that it would legally
                            cease to be valid when new mutual security treaty enters into effect.
                            Consequently, even if no change at all were made in present <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement, it would have to be
                            signed again and would acquire “another personality” in order to be
                            valid in connection with new mutual security treaty. Moreover, while
                            present <gloss target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement had not been
                            submitted to Diet for ratification, subsequent <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                entered into force for the United States June 11, 1954. For text see
                                5 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> (pt. 2) 1123.</note> had been
                            submitted so that in view of Japanese legal experts a new <gloss

                            submitted to Diet together with new mutual security treaty.</p>
                        <p>Theoretically, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> continued,
                            matter might be dealt with in one of following ways: (1) There might be
                            minimum adjustments in language of present <gloss target="#t_Admin1"
                                >admin</gloss> agreement to conform it to new mutual security
                            treaty, but this could not be done by simple exchange of notes as we had
                            proposed but would have to be done by changing text of agreement. (2)
                            There might, in addition, be renegotiation of certain provisions which
                            have caused difficulties in past, thereby making it in fact a new <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement. (3) Present <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement would be submitted to
                            Diet with minimum adjustments conforming it to new treaty, but on
                            “tacit” understanding with us that necessary modifications in <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement would be made in future
                            by mutual agreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he wished to make
                            quite clear that while in Japanese view new <gloss target="#t_Admin1"
                                >admin</gloss> agreement was necessary, they intended to recognize
                            without question the maintenance of existing US facilities and areas in
                            Japan and had no intention of questioning present procedures for
                            acquisition and release of facilities, nor would they propose any
                            modifications in provisions governing jurisdiction and status of US
                            forces in Japan.</p>
                        <p>I said to <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> that question of
                                <gloss target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement together with
                            treaty area were, it seemed to me, the two fundamental problems we had
                            to deal with in text of new treaty. I said it would not be possible for
                            us to sign any new treaty until we were in complete agreement on text of
                                <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0143"/>new <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement. I furthermore stated
                            that until we knew exactly what Japanese had in mind with respect to new
                                <gloss target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement and we were in
                            basic accord with them, it would not in my judgement be feasible to move
                            forward on text of new treaty. Therefore, it was important that we know
                            precisely what they had in mind. If it was to conform present <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">admin</gloss> agreement to new treaty, without
                            basic changes of substance, I felt matter might be handled without undue
                            delay. If, however, Japanese had in mind basic changes of substance, it
                            was clear we were in for long negotiation which would delay concluding
                            treaty itself. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he
                            fully recognized that we must be completely satisfied with new <gloss

                            <item>Over the next five years, Japan will probably remain basically
                                aligned with the US. Within this alignment, however, Japan will be
                                more assertive in pursuing its independent national interests.
                                Supported by a strong and growing economy, Japan probably will
                                increase its economic, political, and diplomatic influence,
                                especially in South and Southeast Asia. Japan will increasingly
                                identify itself with the Afro-Asian states, particularly in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but on fundamental issues
                                will continue to cooperate with the US and the West (Paras. 8, 22,
                                36)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Japan will probably continue to depend primarily on US deterrent
                                strength for its defense. Popular opposition to the idea of
                                rearmament as well as to its cost will continue to restrict Japan’s
                                defense effort, although we believe that this opposition will
                                gradually diminish. We believe that five years from now Japan’s
                                defense establishment will be substantially more modern than now
                                planned. Nevertheless, the armed forces will still have only a
                                limited ability to defend Japan against major attack. (Paras. 21,
                                29)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>If negotiations for revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty end
                                in a mutually satisfactory agreement, the US bases in Japan can be
                                maintained for at least the period of this estimate. If such a
                                mutually satisfactory agreement is not achieved, US-Japanese
                                relations would gradually deteriorate. Even in this situation the US
                                base position could probably be maintained for at least a year or
                                two, but Japanese pressure for the elimination of the bases would
                                increase rapidly and might result in making effective operation of
                                the bases impossible. (Para. 31)</item>

                            <item>We do not believe that the Japanese Government will consent to the
                                deployment of US nuclear weapons in Japan in the foreseeable future.
                                We believe that it would consent to the use of US bases in Japan for
                                the launching of air attacks, nuclear or otherwise, against targets
                                on the mainland of Asia only if Japanese leaders were convinced that
                                Japan itself was directly threatened. In the event of a Communist
                                attack on South Korea it is likely that the Japanese Government
                                would be convinced that Japan itself was directly threatened and
                                would agree to non-nuclear attacks on targets in Korea. It might
                                even agree to the use of nuclear weapons if this appeared necessary
                                to keep South Korea out of Communist hands. In case of US
                                involvement in hostilities with the Communist Bloc in defense of
                                Korea, Taiwan, or Southeast Asia, we believe that the Japanese
                                Government would consent to the use of US bases for staging, supply,
                                and maintenance support of operations. However, it would probably
                                place limitations on such use of the bases, the extent of which
                                would depend upon its own estimate of the importance of the
                                threatened area to Japan’s security as balanced against the degree
                                of risk of Japanese entanglement in the hostilities, and the
                                possibility of retaliatory attack on Japan itself. Regardless of the
                                Japanese Government’s decision, effective and sustained use of US
                                bases in Japan would probably be impossible if the Japanese public
                                in general, and organized labor in particular, actively opposed
                                their use. (Para. 32)</item>

                            <item>Japan’s relations with the Bloc will probably not become close
                                during the next five years. However, Japan will seek to minimize
                                frictions with Moscow and Peiping. Trade with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably continue to
                                increase, but it will amount to only a very small fraction of
                                Japan’s total trade. There will probably be some improvement in the
                                current strained relations with Communist China, and trade with
                                China will probably be resumed within the next year or so. If
                                Communist China is admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                or if other major nations such as Canada and France recognize the
                                Peiping Government, domestic pressures will probably force Japan to
                                offer recognition regardless of US action. However, we do not
                                believe that Japan would recognize Peiping if this entailed
                                acceptance of Communist China’s claim to Taiwan. (Paras.

                            <item>Japan’s present close working relationships with the US will
                                probably continue as long as Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> remains in power. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s political future is
                                uncertain. If he should be replaced by another conservative leader,
                                US-Japanese working relationships would probably be more difficult,
                                especially if the transfer of power were accompanied by acute
                                dissension in conservative ranks. However, we believe that as long
                                as the government remains in conservative hands Japan’s
                                international orientation will remain basically unchanged, and that
                                satisfactory US-Japanese relationships can be maintained. If the
                                Socialists should come to power, which we believe unlikely, Japan’s
                                foreign <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0146"/>policy would move
                                toward a neutralist position and the government would seek closer
                                relations with the Bloc. However, a Socialist government would
                                probably not move as rapidly or as far toward the Bloc as the
                                Socialist Party program suggests. (Paras. 23–24)</item>

                            before attempting reach agreement with them on treaty area. We should
                            not however, delay reaching agreement within USG on what is essential
                            for us in mutual security treaty with Japan. It is still possible that

                                    the mutuality of the proposed security treaty with Japan lay
                                    mainly in the use of bases in Japan. In a conversation with
                                    Senate leaders last September, <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                        >MacArthur</persName> informed them that there were three
                                    possibilities regarding the treaty area: “A. U.S.- and
                                    Japanese-administered islands in Pacific; B. Japan and Article 3
                                    Peace Treaty islands; C. Japan main islands,” None of the
                                    Senators expressed any concern over any of these possibilities
                                    as long as the major objective of aligning Japan with the United
                                    States was achieved. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                    794.5/11–1658) See Supplement.</note> all these possible
                                alternatives of treaty area (US and Japanese-administered islands in
                                Pacific, Japan and Article III Peace Treaty Islands, or Japan main
                                islands only) were explained and none of Senate leaders raised any
                                objection with respect to any one of these alternatives. A good case
                                can be made that Japan would be making much more important
                                contribution to US security, even if treaty area is limited to main
                                islands, than any of our other security partners in Pacific, simply
                                because Japan has great deal more to contribute. But Japanese
                                contribution consists primarily in providing bases and logistical
                                facilities rather than in its military forces, which are relatively
                                small. Provision of Japanese forces to help defend US territory is
                                not necessary in our national interest. On other hand, it would be
                                highly unfortunate if there were any tendency to belittle the great
                                political and psychological importance, not only with respect to
                                Japan but also in terms of free-Asian opinion, of obtaining
                                voluntary, long-term alignment of Japan in vital field of collective
                                military security, which would result from the conclusion of mutual
                                security treaty. For it seems quite clear Japan can only be
                                dependably aligned with the free would in the vitally important
                                field of security through a collective security treaty with us
                                voluntarily entered into.</item>

                            <item>As to “possible nonavailability” of bases and forces in Japan for
                                conduct for military operations and hostilities in which Japan is
                                not engaged, US position, which we have presented to Japanese,
                                already takes <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"/>into account
                                such possible non-availability by our having proposed formula for
                                consultation in event of hostilities in which Japan is not involved.
                                As to our obtaining “indication of Japanese concern” over defense of
                                US territorial interest by their agreeing to use of bases and forces
                                to assist in defending those areas, we have already done this
                                implicitly, subject to consultation formula. However, any notion
                                that Japanese would “agree” in advance is quite unrealistic. None of
                                our other allies will give us blank check to use their territory to
                                conduct military operations in which they are not themselves
                                involved. As to Japanese taking military action within Japan area in
                                event US territories are attacked, they might well do this in
                                defense of Japanese national interests and security, but it would
                                depend upon circumstances and conditions and there is no possibility
                                of obtaining advance commitment. For instance, in case of Soviet
                                overflight of Japanese territory in connection with attack on US
                                territory it is reasonable to expect that Japanese would fully
                                cooperate with us in defense of their own territorial
                                sovereignty.</item>

                            <item>It is still possible that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> may
                                find it feasible to include Ryukyus and Bonins, over which Japan has
                                residual sovereignty, in treaty area. In our opinion, while their
                                inclusion would add another element of mutuality, it is not
                                essential because the really valuable Japanese contribution to
                                mutuality rests in provision of US bases and logistical facilities
                                in Japan and in common action in defense of Japan. (There is

                            exists among conservatives with respect to handling of security treaty
                            itself, there are widely differing views within party about
                            Administrative Agreement and he wished to discuss them with me in all
                            frankness. Opinions on Administrative Agreement within <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> fall essentially into three groups: <list>
                                <item>First, there are those who desire massive revision of
                                    Administrative Agreement now. Such persons usually talk without
                                    knowledge of actual provisions of the agreement and want to make
                                    changes just for the sake of their political impact. This point
                                    of view was definitely opposed by <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName> felt that such persons could be dealt
                                    with.</item>
                                <item>Second, there were some who feel that certain changes of
                                    substance, though not necessarily numerous changes, should be
                                    made in Administrative Agreement, but that negotiations should
                                    be concluded fairly soon. They do not desire to open up entire
                                    agreement for renegotiation. However, they have in mind several
                                    changes in addition to elimination of Articles XXIV and XXV (2)
                                    (b) dealing with consultation and yen contribution. They feel
                                    certain changes are necessary to make Administrative Agreement
                                    less vulnerable to criticism that it is not in line with “new
                                    era of equal partnership.”</item>
                                <item>Third, there is large group who feel that Japan should not at
                                    this time press for more than elimination of Articles XXIV and
                                    XXV (2) (b), provided there is a public understanding between us
                                    that Administrative Agreement will be reopened for renegotiation
                                    after signature of new Mutual Security Treaty.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In any event, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said, legal
                            experts of Foreign Ministry, Prime Minister’s small [<hi rend="italic"
                                >staff</hi>?] and Conservative Party all agree that technically the
                            present Administrative Agreement will expire upon <pb n="123"
                                xml:id="pg_123" facs="0153"/>entry into effect of new Mutual
                            Security Treaty so that, even if no changes were made (beyond changing
                            references from old Security Treaty to new Mutual Security Treaty), it
                            will in any event be essential to have technically “new” Administrative
                            Agreement. This is strictly legal view, and has been fortified by
                            finding of parliamentary experts that Administrative Agreement will have
                            to be submitted to Diet for ratification.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said strong majority of
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> was developing in favor of third
                            alternative above. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            realized third alternative created certain difficulties on our side and
                            in light of this development had asked to see me urgently after dinner
                            in order to put the problem frankly before US and to hear my
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>I said I appreciated frankness with which <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> had spoken and would reply with all frankness
                            although I might have to say some things that he would not like. I said
                            treaty revision basically involves US giving up certain broad rights
                            which we have under present treaty and undertaking a commitment to
                            assist in defense of Japan. In return we would have assured use of bases
                            and facilities on mutually agreed terms and also one intangible element
                            that we regard as of great value: This is strengthening of relationship
                            of friendship, mutuality and durable cooperation in security field on
                            basis of free and voluntary association between our countries. A new
                            security treaty can be presented in Japan as valuable achievement for
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> government in
                            eliminating certain one-sided aspects of present treaty, thus improving
                            atmosphere between our two countries. However, if we were to sign such a
                            treaty, only to be confronted immediately by the prospect of prolonged
                            and perhaps acrimonious debate about Administrative Agreement, the
                            entire idea of new treaty loses its attractiveness for US.</p>
                        <p>I said it would in my opinion be most serious error to proceed along
                            lines of third alternative. Neither our Executive branch nor our Senate
                            would be interested in new security treaty if at same time we are served
                            notice that Administrative Agreement, which spells out what we obtain
                            under treaty, is to come in for extensive and unpredictable
                            renegotiation. Furthermore, our ability to carry out our
                            responsibilities under a new security treaty would depend on a
                            satisfactory Administrative Agreement. Therefore I thought it imperative
                            that we reach agreement on Administrative Agreement before we could
                            conclude a new security treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> then said that under
                            second alternative there would not be major or massive revision, but
                            improvement of appearances and possibly a small number of changes.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he had been
                            taking position <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0154"/>that only
                            substantive changes would be elimination of Articles XXIV and XXV (2)
                            (b) on yen support costs but there was considerable opposition within
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> to restricting changes to these
                            two articles only.</p>
                        <p>At this point I decided (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                                1028)<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"><ref target="#d43">Document
                                    43</ref>.</note> it was best to give <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> clear indication of what we were willing to do
                            and how we envisioned improving appearance of agreement. I said
                            Washington still strongly preferred simply to conform old Administrative
                            Agreement to new treaty by an exchange of letters or documents. Our
                            legal experts did not see why a new agreement was essential. However, in
                            view of position of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> that some form
                            of new Administrative Agreement was required under Japanese laws we were
                            willing to have a new Administrative Agreement which would be
                            technically new since the language would be conformed to the new treaty.
                            There would also be some other modifications of appearance in an effort
                            to be helpful to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and make
                            agreement better received by Japanese public opinion, and we would also
                            agree to drop Article XXIV as proposed by Japanese. I then gave him
                            paper containing changes we are prepared to make (<gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1029).<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5"

                            said I hoped he would agree that we had made a serious effort to be
                            helpful and meet his and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>I also gave <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> draft of

                            confirm our continued use of facilities and areas and that continued
                            validity of decisions, procedures, interpretations, agreed views,
                            arrangements and all other agreements of joint committee (<gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1029). I said it would of
                            course be necessary to exchange letters on these subjects but if
                            Japanese prefer they need not be made public.</p>

                            both realized that we had our problems as well as the fact that they had
                            their problems. He also wished to emphasize that he and <persName

                            question of how to handle Administrative Agreement and they had now come
                            to agree with position I had indicated, that new Mutual Security Treaty
                            and new Administrative Agreement should be one package and that any
                            changes made in latter agreement must be with view to making it durable
                            and not having it all opened up again for renegotiation. Japan and US
                            would of course as in past have right under Article XXVIII to request
                            changes in Administrative Agreement, but object of present exercise
                            should be to have a new Administrative Agreement which would not need to
                            be opened up after it and treaty are ratified. To this end, <gloss

                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> I had been rather
                            disturbed by irresponsible press stories that seem to be grab-bags of
                            all possible features of Administrative Agreement that might come in for
                            revision. I said if such overall revision were proposed it would involve
                            very prolonged negotiations, <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0156"
                            />with prospect that socialists, press and other elements hostile to
                            Govt would seize on every disagreement, in which case I saw no prospect
                            for early conclusion of new Mutual Security Treaty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he had met March 12
                            with <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> Foreign Affairs Research
                            Committee. Most of its members seem to understand that overall revision
                            of Administrative Agreement, opening up virtually all its substantive
                            provisions to re-examination and renegotiation, is neither desirable nor
                            politically necessary at this time. On other hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said, he was forced to report
                            in all frankness that majority opinion among responsible elements of his
                            party does not feel that revision of Administrative Agreement could be
                            limited only to Article XXIV and XXV (2) (b). At present, the various
                            interested ministries and agencies were studying the agreement, in line
                            with customary right to make known their views when an international
                            agreement is under consideration. However, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> added, the results of those studies will be
                            submitted to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> for screening and
                            he hopes to be able to dismiss large number of suggestions for changes
                            as unnecessary or unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>It was his intention, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            said, to keep suggestions for substantive changes to minimum. At same
                            time, however, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> must be in position
                            to answer criticisms that Japan is receiving significantly less
                            favorable treatment than other US Allies. In some cases, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said, such charges could
                            probably be met by mere face-lifting or window-dressing. In other cases
                            he would probably be satisfied with any information or arguments that we
                            might furnish to enable <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to answer
                            such criticisms. Where treatment of Japan is glaringly discriminatory as
                            compared with other US Allies, however, and where such impression cannot
                            be met by appropriate explanations or by changes in form, it may be
                            necessary to contemplate also substantive changes.</p>

                            Japanese have proposed certain modifications of our language to meet

                                >Fujiyama</persName> have been under very heavy pressure, not only
                            from Conservative Party, but from certain Cabinet Ministries such as
                            Finance, <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss>, Justice, and Labor, to
                            press US for massive substantive modifications of existing <gloss

                            proposals in many instances arose from demagoguery of certain <gloss

                            by three important reasons which he and <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> felt deserved consideration: (a) to remove phrases

                            modifications because they believed, after careful study, that they are
                            not necessary, and also because I had pointed out repeatedly that any
                            such proposals on part of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would
                            consume many months or perhaps years of detailed negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said it had been major
                            political problem for him and <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to reconcile requirement of substantial party
                            unity with need to limit proposals for changes in <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">Admin</gloss> Agreement to those they believed
                            would cause US no major difficulties. They met problem in these ways:
                            (a) they have proposed considerable number of changes, many of form
                            only, to improve appearance of <gloss target="#t_Admin1">Admin</gloss>
                            Agreement when it goes to Diet; (b) in certain cases they have proposed
                            no changes in present language of <gloss target="#t_Admin1"
                                >Admin</gloss> Agreement but have suggested agreed interpretive
                            understandings couched in general terms; (c) in several cases where they
                            have serious problems they have put problems to us with request for our
                            view on how they should be dealt with to meet their difficulties rather
                            than proposing new language for <gloss target="#t_Admin1">Admin</gloss>
                            Agreement which might get frozen on Japanese side and limit their
                            ability to work out problems to our satisfaction. Among proposed
                            changes, they have insisted on dropping Article XXV (2b) on yen support
                            costs, as we reported to you they would do. To summarize, Japanese
                            proposals on <gloss target="#t_Admin1">Admin</gloss> Agreement are in
                            three categories: (a) proposed modifications; (b) changes of form or
                            otherwise to improve appearance but not of such basic substance as to
                            give us trouble; (c) problems on which they will ask our views re

                                    realize this will require maximum and extraordinary efforts on

                                    carefully examined. But if we cannot reach agreement on these

                            and that it will be accepted by Japanese public and Diet and will have
                            effect of placing our security relationships with Japan, which are so
                            vital to our own over-all security interests in the Pacific, on much
                            more durable long-term basis.</p>

                                            explained that Japanese legal experts believed “jointly”
                                            in this context would imply integrated effort and thus
                                            impairment of Japanese sovereignty, and also that Japan
                                            might be obligated to contribute to development of its
                                            capacity to resist attack outside of treaty area.

                                            therefore suggested we drop phrase “separately and

                                            “individually and in cooperation with each other”. This
                                            phrase in conjunction with phrase “continuous and
                                            effective self-help and mutual aid, etc.” would seem
                                            fully to preserve intent of our original language which
                                            is based on Vandenberg resolution concept.</item>

                                            in its own opinion there might be no need for such
                                            consultation. Substitution of “at the request of either
                                            party” meets this difficulty, and consultation can still
                                            be held at any time either party considers it necessary
                                            or desirable for any reason.</item>

                                        <item>Substitution of words “international peace and
                                            security in the Far East is threatened” stems from
                                            Japanese acceptance of our proposal to include in
                                            Preamble and Article VI an affirmation of common concern
                                            in peace and security of Far East and to that extent
                                            signifies increased Japanese interest in peace and
                                            security outside treaty area. This would seem to raise
                                            no basic problem, because obviously if either Japan or
                                            US felt peace or security in Far East threatened, there
                                            should be consultation. This same concept appears, of
                                            course, in other of our treaty engagements.</item>

                                <p>Present wording: “Administrative agreement under Article II of
                                    the Security Treaty between the United States of America and
                                    Japan”.</p>

                                    proposal: The word “administrative” translates into Japanese as
                                    “executive” and is not used in agreements which are submitted to
                                    Diet for ratification.</p></item>

                                <p>Reason for change: Since agreement will come before Diet for
                                    ratification, Japanese must avoid form which in Japanese would
                                    be used for executive agreement.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: To amend passage by eliminating words “serving with” so
                                    that it will read: “‘Civilian component’ means the civilian
                                    persons of United States nationality who are in the employ of
                                    and accompanying the United States Armed Forces in Japan . . .
                                    et cetera”.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese feel words “serving with”
                                    are either ambiguous or redundant. They believe it was not
                                    intended to imply that certain civilian persons might be serving
                                    with the US Armed Forces without being in their employ. They
                                    also feel that “or accompanying” seems to set up separate
                                    category of persons who are neither in the employ of US forces
                                    nor serving with them but nevertheless accompanying them. Such
                                    persons would seem to be covered in paragraph <pb n="142"
                                        xml:id="pg_142" facs="0172"/>I (C). Japanese believe their
                                    proposal will merely tighten up language, making it more
                                    understandable and hence defensible, without change in
                                    substance.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: To delete “or who are mentioned paragraph 1 (B) of
                                    Article XIV.”</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: If proposal in paragraph above is
                                    accepted, there would be no need for phrase “or who are
                                    mentioned in paragraph 1 (B) of Article XIV.” That phrase
                                    appears to have been originally inserted in view of possible
                                    doubt whether Article XIV contractors might be covered by
                                    Article I (B) and specifically excluded them. Japanese proposal
                                    to clarify definition would remove any such doubt and therefore
                                    exclusion of such persons would no longer have to be
                                    specifically stated.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: Reword as follows: “1. A. The United States of America
                                    is granted, under Article VI of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
                                    and Security, the use of facilities and areas in Japan.
                                    Agreements as to specific facilities and areas shall be
                                    concluded by the two governments through the joint committee
                                    provided for in Article XXV of this agreement. Facilities and
                                    areas–include existing furnishings, equipment and fixtures
                                    necessary to the operation of such facilities and areas.</p>
                                <p>B. The facilities and areas of which the United States of America
                                    has the use at the time of expiration of the administrative
                                    agreement under Article III of the Security Treaty between Japan
                                    and the United States, shall be considered as the facilities and
                                    areas agreed upon between the two governments in accordance with
                                    subparagraph (A) above.”</p>
                                <p>Reason: <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considers that
                                    proposed formulation would give us stronger assurance of

                                    which would have essentially old language of paragraph 1
                                    emplified by exchange of notes as per <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"

                                    that exchange of notes would not have clearly covered unagreed
                                    facilities and areas whose use we have under Rusk–Okazaki
                                    exchange of notes of February 28, 1952. Moreover, second
                                    sentence in paragraph 1 of old administrative agreements
                                    (“agreements as to specific facilities and areas not already
                                    reached by the two governments by the effective date of this
                                    agreement, shall be concluded. . . etc.”) would not necessarily
                                    have assured us of continued use of such facilities.</p>
                                <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0173"/>
                                <p>Rather than strengthen the exchange of notes which we had
                                    proposed and which would have been classified, we thought it
                                    preferable to have <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> grant us
                                    explicitly the continued use of all facilities and areas in new
                                    agreement. Our modifications in paragraph 1 (A) pick up
                                    operative language from Article VI of new Mutual Security Treaty

                                    which would be unnecessary in view of sweeping public assurance
                                    of continued use of facilities and areas in paragraph (B).</p>
                                <p>I believe that by accepting proposed modifications, we gain two
                                    advantages: Attention will not be publicly drawn to fact that
                                    there are still facilities and areas in use by US forces without
                                    Japanese agreement seven years after an exchange of notes which
                                    had contemplated such agreement within “ninety days”. In
                                    addition, we obtain clear assurance of our rights to facilities
                                    and areas since language will now be integral part of new
                                    agreement regarding facilities and areas.</p>
                                <p>Since assurance of continued use of facilities and areas would be
                                    contained in body of new agreement itself, exchange of notes

                                <p>Proposal: To amend subparagraph to read: “When facilities and
                                    areas are temporarily not being used by the United States Armed
                                    Forces, the Japanese Government may make, or permit Japanese
                                    nationals to make, interim use of such facilities and areas
                                    provided that it is agreed between the two governments that such
                                    use would not be harmful to the purposes for which the
                                    facilities and areas are normally used by the United States
                                    Armed Forces”.</p>
                                <p>If foregoing amendment is accepted, the words “such” and “as
                                    target ranges and maneuver grounds” in paragraph 4 (B) would
                                    also be dropped for same reason.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese realize that intent of
                                    singling out “target ranges and maneuver grounds” was to
                                    illustrate some facilities and areas rather than to place
                                    limitation on facilities and areas whose interim use might be
                                    granted.</p>
                                <p>They feel that without change in substance, appearance of this
                                    paragraph could be considerably improved by deleting the
                                    illustrative clause. They also feel that unused facilities and
                                    areas should not be turned over to Japanese nationals without
                                    knowledge or authority of Japanese Government, and have
                                    therefore inserted language which would without diminishing US
                                    control appear to leave to Japanese Government appropriate
                                    authority over interim use.</p></item>

                                    might not convey all the substantive meaning that is contained
                                    in the words “rights, power and authority”; and whether

                                <p>Question re need for last sentence: Japanese believe sentence to
                                    be obsolete. What was temporary seven years ago they say has
                                    long since been replaced by specific arrangements concluded
                                    under second sentence of paragraph 2 and such arrangements are
                                    working satisfactorily. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is

                                <p>Proposal: To have second sentence read “When cargo or passengers
                                    not accorded the exemptions of this agreement are carried on
                                    such vessels and aircraft, notification shall be given to the
                                    appropriate Japanese authorities, and their entry and departure
                                    from Japan shall be according to the laws and regulations of
                                    Japan”.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese feel that cargo or
                                    passengers not entitled to exemptions of administrative
                                    agreement should not only enter but also leave according to laws

                                    might give rise to questions in Diet. They believe that

                                    believes “airports” was inadvertently omitted since both vessels

                                <p>Reason for proposed change: “Present procedures” in this article

                                    have long since been modified by mutual agreement. Japan has

                                <p>Reason for proposed change: In addition to “conforming” change
                                    which would remove the word “right” (paragraph 1–C <gloss
                                        target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1029), Japanese would

                                    issued by the United States authorities which must be presented
                                    on demand to the appropriate Japanese authorities so that their
                                    status may be verified upon their entry into or departure from
                                    Japan, or while in Japan.”</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposal: Public appearances would be considerably
                                    improved if the relevant paragraphs not only stated that
                                    American personnel required appropriate documentation but also
                                    that they should present it on demand to appropriate Japanese
                                    authorities. Japanese feel this must clearly have been intent of
                                    original wording, since compliance with the provisions in
                                    question could only be verified in such manner and since even
                                    diplomats must produce identity documents when so requested by
                                    authorities. Moreover, in existing practice Japanese authorities
                                    are invariably being shown identity documents when they request
                                    it. Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> feels that
                                    spelling out such requirement would not involve difference in
                                    substance or practice.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: To add to paragraph 5 new final sentence “If the
                                    Japanese Government, for good cause, has requested the removal
                                    from its territory of a member of the United States Armed
                                    Forces, or of the civilian component, or a dependent, the United

                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese wish to add provision that

                                    believed to involve little, if any, change from present

                                <p>Present wording: This long paragraph dealing with duty-free

                                    Forces, the <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0177"/>authorized

                                <p>Question: Japanese say they are agreeable to substance of this
                                    paragraph but would like to know why words “authorized
                                    procurement agencies of the United States Armed Forces” are
                                    necessary and how best their retention could be defended in
                                    Diet. They ask if “authorized procurement agencies of the US
                                    Armed Forces” are not a part of US Armed Forces? Similarly, they
                                    ask clarification of phrase “or are ultimately to be
                                    incorporated into articles or facilities used by such forces”.
                                    Needless to say, Japanese would prefer phrases in question to be
                                    eliminated. Believe they would be satisfied however, with
                                    adequate explanations which they could use in defending
                                    retention.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: To add sentence “such supplies or construction work

                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese are agreeable to substance
                                    and wording of above sentence, but wish it to be stated that,
                                    provided we agree, there may also be procurement through the

                                    working satisfactorily. Proposed new paragraph is to call

                                    percent by US and 25 percent by Japan. Writing this arrangement
                                    into the agreement would, in Japanese view, entail no actual

                                <p>Proposal: To reword this sub-paragraph so that it will read
                                    “members of the US Armed Forces and of the civilian component
                                    shall not be subject to suit in Japan with respect to claims
                                    specified in paragraph 3, but shall be subject to the civil
                                    jurisdiction of Japanese courts with respect to all other types
                                    of cases.”</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Japanese do not propose to change
                                    substance of this sub-paragraph. They note, however, that the
                                    term “civilian employees” does not appear anywhere else in the
                                    Administrative Agreement and that it is not defined. They state
                                    Japanese employees could not have been meant since they are
                                    specifically excluded. They fear that if called upon to explain
                                    present wording in Diet, it may be difficult to do so.
                                    Therefore, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> proposes to
                                    simplify wording and to use phrase “civilian component” defined
                                    in Article I.</p></item>

                                <p>Present wording: “The United States shall have the right to
                                    enroll and train all eligible United States citizens, residing

                                <p>Proposal: To reword article so it would read “The United States

                                <p>Reason for proposal: <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> believes
                                    language may be permissive in form because US never requested
                                    right to conscript United States citizens in Japan, since
                                    present Article XXII is clearly limited to reserve
                                    organizations. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is anxious to
                                    be in better position to meet opposition charges that US would
                                    be able to enroll private US citizens residing in Japan, even
                                    against their will. They are particularly sensitive on this
                                    point because as they frankly admit they had such rights in
                                    their prewar occupation of Mainland China, and anything smacking
                                    of this practice would appear to Diet as serious derogation of
                                    Japanese sovereignty. Japanese believe their new language would
                                    not result in substantive change.</p>
                                <p>Since new language emphasizes voluntary practice, they propose
                                    drop final clause. If changes involve major difficulty for US,
                                    they would appreciate being informed of nature such difficulty
                                    in terms they may use in Diet.</p></item>

                                <p>Reason for deletion: Japanese have strongly insisted on deletion

                                    Japan and the US. Both from Japanese and from US point of view,
                                    yen contribution is heavy political liability. Its original
                                    purpose to encourage Japanese defense build-up while
                                    compensating US for its share in defending Japan, can no longer
                                    be accomplished in this manner, the basic concept of new Mutual
                                    Security Treaty in any event contemplates not money contribution
                                    but granting of facilities and areas as Japanese contribution in
                                    return for US commitment to regard attack against Japan as

                                                enters into effect. At same time they understand

                                                agreement and that we will not present new treaty

                                                approved both treaty and new agreement. They have

                                                view not essential, but represents attempt to carry

                                    or “parties”, in Article II paragraph 2 and in Articles XXVII
                                    and XXIX. Also, to write “Government of <pb n="152"
                                        xml:id="pg_152" facs="0182"/>Japan” and/or “Government of
                                    United States” in place of “Japanese” and “United States
                                    Government” in Articles IV paragraph 3, IX/1, IX/5, XI/9(A),
                                    XI/9(D), XII/1, XIII, XIV/6, XVIII/11, XIX/1, XX/1(A), XX/1(B),
                                    XXIII, XXIV and XXV. In Japanese version, word “Japan” would
                                    precede “United States” while in US (English) version “United
                                    States” would precede “Japan”.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposal: In view of fact agreement will be ratified
                                    by Diet, the term “the parties” could be construed as meaning
                                    not only <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> but also
                                    legislature. Also, throughout agreement <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> would prefer use of term “Government of Japan”
                                    to “Japanese Government”. To conform to this change, “United
                                    States Government” would be replaced by “Government of United
                                    States”. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would also prefer
                                    “Japan” to precede “United States” in Japanese text.</p></item>

                                <p>Suggested changes: (A) In Article II paragraph 4A, add “between
                                    the two governments” after “provided that it is agreed”. (B) In
                                    Article III paragraph 2, replace “by mutual agreement” in second
                                    sentence with “by agreement between the two governments”. (C) In
                                    Article VI paragraph 1 add “between the two governments” after
                                    “procedure will be established by mutual arrangement”. (D) In
                                    Article XI paragraph 6, also Article XII old paragraph 8 and
                                    Article XV paragraph 3, replace “in accordance with conditions
                                    agreed upon between the two governments”. (E) In Article XII
                                    paragraph 5 and Article XV paragraph 4, “between the two
                                    governments” after “except as may otherwise be agreed”.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposal: In number of places, present administrative
                                    agreement calls for “mutual agreement” on implementing features.
                                    Inasmuch as new agreement itself will go to Diet for
                                    ratification, Japanese are anxious to make it clear that such
                                    “mutual agreements” will be between the two governments as
                                    executive actions and not by any stretch of imagination subject
                                    to further Diet approval. Hence <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> proposes tightening-up by stating “by agreement
                                    between the two governments” in place of “by mutual agreement”.
                                    Since the new administrative agreement is in any case treated by
                                    us as executive agreement, Japanese have assumed that suggested
                                    change involves no difficulty for us. From our point of view we
                                    think it most important to emphasize that subsequent or
                                    implementing agreements will not require Diet action.</p></item>

                                <p>Proposal: To have first sentence read “In witness whereof the
                                    undersigned plenipotentiaries have signed this agreement”.</p>
                                <p>Reason for proposed change: Since new agreement is to be approved
                                    by Diet (even though we regard it and will treat it in every
                                    respect as executive agreement), Japanese desire it to be signed
                                    by “plenipotentiaries”. They would also understand that in
                                    English-language <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0183"
                                    />version, the word “English” would come first while in
                                    Japanese-language version the word “Japanese” would come
                                    first.</p></item>

                                                members of United States Armed Forces shall be in
                                                possession of travel orders upon entry into Japan,
                                                Article I (a) appears to define members of United
                                                States Armed Forces, by implication, as all
                                                personnel on active duty. Japanese desire to clear
                                                up this discrepancy by having it understood that
                                                members who do not possess travel orders (which
                                                might include leave orders) would not be entitled to
                                                privileges of Administrative Agreement. However, in
                                                order not unduly to disturb language of the

                                                exchange of notes. Its effect would be to make clear
                                                that privileges of Administrative Agreement do not
                                                extend to any member of US Armed Forces who enters

                                    interests and rest of Cabinet that it is unfair that certain
                                    American contractors enjoy privileges for carrying out contracts
                                    which give them competitive advantage over local Japanese of
                                    non-privileged American contractors. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> finds it cannot continue justify Article XIV if
                                    privileged contractors (a) were to participate in open bidding
                                    together with non-privileged contractors of (b) if they were to
                                    engage in Japan in any non-military contracts.</p>
                                <p><gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> does not propose to restrict
                                    in any way free US choice of contractors to satisfy needs of US
                                    forces in Japan. However, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName> points out that continuation of present
                                    language in Article XIV attracts attention not only to
                                    privileges granted US contractors, but also to privileges for
                                    members of US forces, civilian component, and dependents, which
                                        <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has no desire to see
                                    restricted. I believe if at all possible this strongly in our
                                    interests to eliminate this special privilege position for US
                                    contractors, for it is going to be a source of major trouble for
                                    us from now on. If we rigidly insist on Article XIV privileges
                                    for all these favored contractors we may not only jeopardize
                                    privileges armed forces enjoy and require here but we risk
                                    courting publicity on issue which competing private business
                                    firms in Japan also resent. However, I believe I could get
                                    Japanese to agree to extending such privileges where necessary
                                    to US contractors if they were brought into Japan solely for
                                    purpose of doing work for our military and engage in no other
                                    business whatsoever in Japan.</p></item>

                                <p>The present provisions stipulate mutual waiver of claims as

                                    agencies. Article was drafted at time when Japan had no
                                    self-defense forces. Now that Japan has such forces, the
                                    Japanese believe it reasonable to stipulate such waiver as
                                    between the self-defense forces and the United States Armed
                                    Forces rather than between US forces and all Japanese Govt
                                    agencies. The Japanese hope that in light of arrangements we
                                    have in other countries, we may be able to come forward with
                                    mutually acceptable proposal which would remove what at present
                                    appears as glaring inequality. Revision of this article would

                                <p>Japanese say question of duty determination under Article XVIII
                                    (civil claims) does not involve jurisdiction in sense of trial
                                    by US versus Japanese court since under paragraph 3, any cases
                                    that go to court will in any event go to a Japanese court and
                                    under paragraph 5, actions [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and in
                                    any event be taken in Japanese court. Question of duty
                                    determination is of importance in deciding whether case shall be
                                    treated under paragraph 3 (adjudication by Japanese, with costs
                                    shared between US and Japan) or under paragraph 5 (ex gratia
                                    payment by US).</p>
                                <p>Under paragraph 4 as presently worded, duty determination is made
                                    unilaterally by US. It may be challenged in joint committee, but
                                    there is no provision for arbitration or for judicial
                                    consideration of facts involved in duty determination. <persName

                                    one on which Diet can be expected to focus full spotlight of

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKGJ1">Harr</persName> presented the reference
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Report on the subject to the
                            Council. He said that the U.S. has no operational difficulties with
                            respect to Japan of such a magnitude as to threaten the successful
                            pursuit of our objectives there, but the <gloss target="#t_OCB1"
                                >OCB</gloss> believes that our policy toward Japan should be
                            reviewed because it has become apparent, particularly during the eight
                            and a half months covered by the report, that one era of Japanese-U.S.
                            relations has come to an end and another has begun. During this period
                            there has been an easing of the tensions between the U.S. and Japan
                            which stemmed from the vestiges of World War II. Similarly, the period
                            has seen indications of the beginning of a new era in which Japanese
                            dependence upon the U.S. is reduced and Japan is taking an increasingly
                            independent approach to foreign policy. Because the climate surrounding
                            the negotiations for the revision of U.S.-Japanese security arrangements
                            will be the best test of the new era in U.S.-Japanese relations, the
                                <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> recommends that a review of our
                            policy toward Japan be initiated as soon as sufficient time has passed
                            to permit an evaluation of the progress of such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he
                            had recently had an opportunity to talk to our Ambassador to Japan about
                            the forthcoming negotiations for a revision in U.S.-Japanese security
                            arrangements. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"

                            reaching a satisfactory agreement. Yesterday a complete statement of the

                                >MacArthur</persName> and the Japanese Government had agreed that
                            final signatures to a revised U.S.-Japanese agreement should be affixed
                            in Washington before June 20. Moreover, there should be agreement in
                            substance between the two Governments sufficiently early so that the
                            fact of <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0190"/>agreement could be
                            announced at least a week before June 2, the date of elections to the
                            Upper House of the Japanese Parliament. Such an announcement would be of
                            considerable help to the Japanese Government against the Socialists in
                            the election. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> hopes that the U.S. comments on the Japanese
                            position can be received in Tokyo by May 10. A State-Defense working
                            group is starting today to analyze the Japanese position. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concurred in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> recommendation for a review of our
                            policy toward Japan, but thought that the current negotiations were
                            moving so fast that it might be desirable to delay such a review until
                            June.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered whether we were adequately staffed to undertake
                            the task of making major revisions in our treaty relations with Japan in
                            such a short time. He recalled that some years ago when we made the
                            first Peace Treaty with Japan we had brought <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >John Foster Dulles</persName> in for a year’s work. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the Peace Treaty with
                            Japan was not being revised at this time; the current negotiations
                            concerned only U.S.-Japanese security arrangements. The President said
                            he had been under the mistaken impression that the Peace Treaty was
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> remarked that
                            as we looked down the road ahead, it would be necessary for us to
                            consider very carefully the future security of Japan and our relations
                            with that country. The President agreed; and added that there were two
                            counter-weights to Communist China in the Far East; namely, Japan and
                            India. We had better continue to think very seriously about these two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that the Planning
                            Board would review <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5516/1 at an

                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                            for return to Japan of administrative control of Ryukyus and Bonins and
                            President had then made clear that while Japan possesses residual
                            sovereignty, US found it necessary to continue present status so long as
                            conditions of threat and tension exist in <gloss target="#t_FE1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> referred to my

                            long as situation in Ryukyus was calm, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> will not publicly press US for return of administrative
                            control. He said neither he nor <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> wished to raise return to Japan of administrative
                            control, but would be obliged to do so if reaffirmation of our position
                            included fact that we would have to remain in Article 3 islands
                            indefinitely. He asked that consideration be given to a simple exchange
                            of notes whereby US note would (a) make clear that when administrative
                            control is returned to Japan, Article 3 islands will be included in
                            treaty area under Article V of new treaty, and (b) that Japan possesses
                            residual sovereignty. Japan would make simple acknowledgement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> handed me following draft note
                            for our consideration:</p>
                        <p>Begin text draft US note:</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to refer to the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
                            Security between the United States of America and Japan signed
                            today.</p>
                        <p>It is the understanding of my government that any territories of Japan
                            presently not under its administration shall as a matter of course come
                            within the purview of Article V as they are restored to the
                            administrative control of Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0192"/>
                        <p>In this connection I wish to reaffirm the United States position that
                            Japan possesses residual sovereignty over the islands mentioned in
                            Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan which have not yet been
                            restored to the administrative control of Japan. End draft US text.</p>
                        <p>Begin text draft Japanese note: I have the honour to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of today’s date concerning the Treaty of Mutual
                            Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States of America,
                            which reads as follows: (Text of US note to be inserted here.)</p>
                        <p>I appreciate the reaffirmation of the United States position that Japan
                            possesses residual sovereignty over the islands mentioned in the above
                            and have the honour to confirm that the understanding of the United
                            States Government concerning territories presently not under the
                            administration of Japan is also the understanding of my government. End
                            draft Japanese text.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Neither <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> nor <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            wishes to handle this matter in a way which would oblige <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> publicly to request return of
                            administration of Okinawa. On other hand, both feel that reaffirmation
                            of Japanese residual sovereignty is major element in their ability to
                            defend present treaty area, which excludes Article 3 islands. I think
                            they have in mind particularly Ryukyuans, but also <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName> and certain anti-mainstreamers.
                            While originally I had felt reaffirmation of
                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> communiqué language was best solution, on second
                            thought this would be unwise since it would reopen Japanese demand for
                            return of administration. I now feel there is advantage in going along
                            with substance of Japanese proposal since by doing so we can avoid
                            possibility that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would feel obliged
                            to press US publicly for return of administrative control. I would
                            greatly appreciate General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDP1"
                                >Booth</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it would certainly seem strongly in our own interest to
                            try to assist <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> to handle this problem in way
                            which will gain fullest acceptance of treaty area both in Ryukyus and
                            Japan and at same time give us some assurance that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> will not publicly raise question of
                            return of islands to Japanese administration.</p>

                            <item><p>Article VIII. We have serious objections to inclusion in treaty
                                    of special article on constitutionality qualifying whole treaty.
                                    First, there is no similar provision in any of our other mutual
                                    security arrangements and Congress is bound to question
                                    inclusion this article in Japanese arrangements very closely.
                                    Second, we fear other countries may raise problems with us re
                                    this Article and seek similar relief from obligations incurred
                                    in treaty arrangements on basis conflict with constitution.
                                    Third, there is problem whether under US constitutional system
                                    Executive Branch can so explicitly assert its authority to
                                    interpret constitution. You might explain to Japanese that as
                                    this provision presently drafted it could be construed as effort
                                    by Executive Branch to assert powers of US judiciary as final
                                    arbiter interpreting our constitution. Finally, present language
                                    Article VIII conceivably could permit either Government to seek
                                    relief from obligations under treaty, for example Article VI
                                    provisions, at some future time on basis obligation in conflict
                                    with their constitution as then interpreted. Under accepted
                                    international law, country does not escape from international
                                    obligations entered into in treaties even when such treaties may
                                    be declared unconstitutional for purposes of domestic law.</p>

                                <p>We recognize, however, constitution issue very delicate and
                                    crucial point in Japan. Therefore, propose that as addition at

                            <item><p>Japanese note for consultation formula should be revised as
                                    follows: Word “combat” should be inserted between “military” and
                                    “operations.” Alternative would be to substitute “combat” for
                                    “military.” Reason: Word “military” standing alone is much too
                                    broad and can be construed to involve all operations including
                                    logistics at the bases. If Japanese flatly reject above
                                    proposal, only other acceptable alternative to us is to retain

                            strongly to him the points regarding treaty and consultation formula,
                            explaining in detail why particular changes are important and why
                            certain language proposed by Japanese, notably new Article VIII, cannot
                            be accepted by us.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines of source text) not

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> asked me to convey his
                            deep appreciation for speedy handling of Japanese proposals by COMUS,
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and Departments of State
                            and Defense. He said he would personally study them carefully prior to
                            his departure for Saigon tomorrow and that Vice Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> would be in touch with me to
                            convey <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> views. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said some of our points raised
                            real problems for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. He referred
                            notably to deletion of Article VIII, which he said would raise serious
                            “constitutional” difficulties in connection with Article III since it
                            might be claimed that article obliges Japan to develop its capacity to
                            resist attack beyond restrictions of Japanese Constitution which limit
                            Japan’s efforts to self-defense of Japan. He also felt that insertion of
                            “individual and <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0200"/>collective” in
                            Article III would raise parliamentary difficulties. He was much
                            concerned over proposal to include “Pacific area.” Re consultation
                            formula he questioned phrase “in the light of circumstances prevailing
                            at the time” as exceedingly difficult to interpret to the Diet. He said
                            foregoing were preliminary observations and <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> would give me definite <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> reaction.</p>
                        <p>Speaking personally, I said that while Washington finds it impossible, in
                            view strict separation of powers between executive and judiciary, to
                            accept Japanese proposed Article VIII, it might be possible to meet
                            Japanese problem in connection with Article III by inserting at
                            appropriate point a phrase such as “in accordance with their
                            constitutional provisions.” I said that if <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> thought such addition would meet problem of
                            elimination of Article VIII, I would be personally willing recommend it
                            strongly to Washington.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> also inquired about
                            Administrative Agreement. I said <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            proposals are receiving most urgent consideration in Washington and I
                            hoped to transmit official US reactions within two days. <persName

                                >Yamada</persName> was authorized to discuss with me both treaty and
                            Administrative Agreement during his absence, so that we might make

                        <p>We agree necessity for certain revisions in Administrative Agreement to
                            make it politically acceptable in Japan. Such revisions are consistent
                            with our interest in reducing to maximum extent possible areas <pb

                            exchange of notes re Residual Sovereignty. Serious concern expressed
                            that exchange of notes reaffirming Japanese residual sovereignty over
                            Article III islands linked with suggestion that islands may at future
                            time fall under new Treaty will give rise to false hopes and increased
                            pressures on part of Japanese public and Ryukyuans for early return of
                            administration of islands to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Recognize that exchange of notes proposed as tactic to enable <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> resist opposition when new treaty
                            before Diet. However, since exchange might be interpreted as indicating
                            that return Article III islands was considered during treaty
                            negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> might well be
                            subjected to criticism for not pressing for early return of islands.</p>
                        <p>In view of foregoing, request you explore with <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> means of meeting Diet opposition other than
                            through proposed exchange of notes. One possible means to reaffirm
                            Japanese residual sovereignty is by your making public statement along
                            lines <persName>Eisenhower</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> communiqué of 1957. If question arises in Diet
                            whether islands would fall within treaty area should their
                            administration be returned to Japan, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> could reply affirmatively, pointing out that
                            treaty specifically speaks of territory under the administration of
                            Japan which would include Article III islands if they are returned to
                            Japan’s administration while treaty still in force. Foregoing approach
                            would follow line <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has taken
                            before Diet and public that there is no connection between negotiations

                                        >GOJ</gloss> could not accept inclusion this phrase.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> realizes that
                                    addition would not create any new obligation for Japan and
                                    indeed that it could be held to have no substantive importance.
                                    However it does not [garble], and Japanese Diet, press, and
                                    public <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"/>would, when

                                        >Fujiyama</persName> strongly to accept “individually and

                                        >reftel</gloss> but <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                        >Fujiyama</persName> said Japanese could not agree to
                                    include this phrase. He insisted that in Japanese language this
                                    would have inescapable implication that treaty was intended to
                                    provide for Japanese membership in some regional collective
                                    security pact. He and <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                        >Kishi</persName> had concluded that this phrase remained
                                    unacceptable. He recognized that “collective” is mentioned in
                                    Preamble in connection with inherent rights under <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter but use in context of
                                    Article III would be interpreted quite differently. He pointed
                                    out that word “collective” does not appear in corresponding
                                    Article II of US-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Mutual
                                    Defense Treaty. In view foregoing I said I would recommend that
                                    we accept alternative of “their capacities” (last sentence para
                                    4 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1673) to which he
                                    agreed. (Since I pressed very hard for inclusion of “individual
                                    and collective” I would not tell him I was authorized to agree
                                    to deletion. Accordingly when next I meet with him, I will tell
                                    him we accept deletion of this phrase as authorized in <gloss

                                        the same reasons that original Japanese Article VIII was
                                        unacceptable since it carried in it implication that
                                        executive branch of Govt would interpret what were
                                        constitutional limitations.</p>

                                        were different. I said only remaining way for Japan to
                                        handle this matter that I could envisage would be for

                                        signed or sent to Diet, indicating that nothing in the

                            raised constitutional problem for Japanese in new mutual security treaty
                            and asked me whether we could reconsider acceptance of Japanese Article
                            VIII (<gloss target="#t_Secnog1">Secnog</gloss> 2). I replied that this
                            article was totally unacceptable and explained again reasons why. He
                            then asked me to enquire whether Washington would accept inclusion of
                            phrase “within their constitution limitations” in Article III. (See para
                            7 of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>I said I would ask <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> for specific
                            answer to this query but as I had pointed out to him on May 23, I
                            believe this proposal would be unacceptable since it might be read to
                            imply that executive branch would interpret what were limitations of our
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said <persName

                            separate article making it clear that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> has not obligated itself to do anything contrary to

                            phrase in Article III it might solve their problem. He said this issue
                            is major remaining problem and of such importance to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and him that he requested

                                    required for self-defense; (c) that nothing in constitution
                                    precludes Japan from concluding security treaty with foreign
                                    country or having foreign troops stationed in Japan.</item>

                                    simply be taken for granted. Question is not whether they are

                                    It does not say that all provisions of treaty should be
                                    considered constitutional. It simply says that treaty provisions
                                    (not constitutional provisions) should not be interpreted in
                                    such manner as may involve violation of constitutional
                                    provisions. It proposes to adjust scope of treaty provisions to
                                    framework of constitution.</item>

                                <item>If it is impossible for US Govt to accept Article VIII for
                                    constitutional reasons, it may be reworded to read for instance:
                                    “nothing in this treaty shall be construed as constituting any
                                    undertaking by Japan exceeding its constitutional limitations.”
                                    This is entirely one-sided proposition. This one-sidedness
                                    however does not make proposition more fit to be incorporated in

                                    more important that US acceptance thereof is clearly

                                <item>There may be no such precedent in treaties concluded by US so
                                    far. But lack of precedent or one-sidedness might very well be
                                    justified if uniqueness of Article 9 of Japanese Constitution is
                                    taken into consideration.</item>

                                <item>Heated debate arose over constitutionality of provisions of
                                    MDA Agreement in course its deliberation in Diet, despite
                                    provisions of its Article IX, para 2. Use of term “shall be
                                    implemented” gives impression that provisions of treaty
                                    themselves or obligations embodied therein extend beyond scope
                                    of constitutional provisions. Furthermore, as has been pointed
                                    out in (1) and (2) above, there is nothing in constitution
                                    itself which provides ground for maintaining defense capacity.
                                    Expression “in accordance with the constitutional provisions”
                                    does not seem adequately to reflect this constitutional
                                    inhibition. Therefore we would like to avoid using same formula
                                    in new treaty, if at all possible.</item>

                                <item>Problem of constitutionality has become highly controversial
                                    issue particularly since Sunagawa case.<note n="2"
                                        xml:id="d67fn2">The Sunagawa case involved seven Japanese
                                        who in 1957 penetrated several feet into the U.S. Tachikawa
                                        Air Base. A Japanese court of original jurisdiction held
                                        that the defendants were not guilty on grounds that Special
                                        Criminal Law, under which they had been indicted, was
                                        unconstitutional. The law had been enacted in accordance
                                        with the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the Administrative
                                        Agreement. The Japanese Supreme Court, however, reversed
                                        this decision of the lower court in December 1959 by
                                        clarifying Japan’s right of self-defense and by confirming
                                        the constitutionality of the stationing of U.S. military
                                        forces in Japan. Documents related to this subject are in
                                        Department of State, Central File 794.56311.</note> In order
                                    to gain popular support for new treaty therefore we feel it
                                    highly important to leave no room for any dispute or doubt on
                                    this point. That is reason why <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> has been emphasizing point that, contrary to
                                    allegations of anti-revisionists, new treaty would remain within
                                    framework of constitution. <hi rend="italic">End

                        <p>I said we understand and sympathize with Japan’s problem but we, too,
                            have problem because executive branch cannot place itself in position of
                            concluding treaty which might be read to imply that executive branch
                            could interpret our constitution. Furthermore, I did not think Japanese
                            formulation of Article VIII contained in above paper would be acceptable
                            since in effect Japanese were trying to place US in position where it
                            interpreted Japanese constitution. This, I felt certain, we could never
                            accept, although Japanese could always make unilateral statement to this
                            effect, as I had mentioned in our last meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> then asked whether we
                            could accept provision which would clearly put it up to judiciary to
                            interpret constitutionality of treaty. I said this would only compound
                            our difficulty as in effect it could be interpreted to mean that our
                            Supreme Court must pass on constitutionality of draft treaties before
                            such treaties were signed or sent to Senate for ratification. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he could see no way out of
                            dilemma for moment except perhaps by including phrase “within their
                            constitutional limitations” in Article III. However, he would study
                            matter further and hoped we would also study possibility of including
                            above phrase in Article III or would propose some other solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> then proposed that Article
                            VII should read: “Nothing in present treaty shall impose on either party
                            any obligation not in conformity with its constitution.” I said in my
                            judgement this was open to same basic objection as original Article
                            VIII.</p>
                        <p>At conclusion of meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> I met privately and alone with <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> at his request. He said he hoped
                            earnestly we could accept inclusion of “within their constitutional
                            limitations” in Article III. I said I would enquire but doubted
                            seriously our ability to do so.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> asked me if we could accept phrase “subject to
                            their constitutional provisions” in Article III. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> that if this would solve problem,
                            I felt there was very good prospect we could accept this phrase and I
                            would strongly recommend it to Washington. <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> said he had not discussed this with <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> but he would immediately start
                            to work on Japanese legal experts in <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                                >FonOff</gloss> and PriMin’s office to accept this solution.</p>

                                >Kishi</persName> asked me to meet privately with him last evening
                            to give me his general assessment of Japanese political picture in light
                            of recent elections. Only Wada (as interpreter) was present.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was elated over election
                            results and believed it would greatly strengthen his position. He felt
                            important factors in <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> success in
                            upper house elections were <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> victories
                            in Osaka and Tokyo gubernatorial elections last April. He commented that
                            had Tokyo been lost to Socialists in April, he did not believe he would
                            have been able to remain in office very long.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was especially happy that
                            principal issue in upper house elections had been foreign policy,
                            particularly Japan’s close ties with US in security field. He said
                            election results clearly demonstrated that <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                                facs="0216"/>preponderant majority of Japanese fully support his
                            policy of increasingly close ties with US and other free world countries
                            and at same time clearly reject neutralism. This he felt would be very
                            helpful when new US-Japan security treaty comes up for
                            ratifications.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he is now engaged in
                            study very complex problem of reshuffling cabinet and top party posts.
                            He commented wryly that “this reshuffle is much more difficult than
                            winning an election”. He believes there is reasonable chance that both
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> may accept a top party or cabinet
                            post. However in this connection he said his most difficult problem is
                            to try to find slots in cabinet or party that will balance off <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KI4"

                            better post. I mentioned reports that <persName corresp="#p_KI4"
                                >Kono</persName> might be given secgen-ship of <gloss

                                >Kishi</persName> shook his head and said this would result in
                            increased factional cleavage within <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                            >LDP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> whether in his
                            judgement Socialist defeat would lead to split in Socialist Party.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he knew on reliable
                            authority that <persName corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> is deeply
                            disturbed over present leadership of Socialist Party and pro-leftist
                            orientation of its policy and is contemplating splitting if present
                            leftist policies of party are continued. In confidence, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that should <persName
                                corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> split away from Socialist Party,
                            he personally would not object if twenty or so of more liberal <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> members of Diet join with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> faction. This he said would give
                                <persName corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> group sufficient
                            members and standing to exercise strong appeal to Socialist voters at
                            expense of left-wing socialists.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether as result of upper house election victory <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> had any plans to change electoral law
                            for upper house by eliminating provision for national constituencies
                            which gave great advantage to Sohyo and left-wing labor unions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> wished to eliminate national
                            constituencies and he thought election results would be helpful to
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> in this respect since there was
                            growing doubt and even criticism among public and press as to soundness
                            of a national constituency system which gave advantages to special
                            pressure groups. However, he had no intention of acting precipitously
                            and said there was ample time to consider how best to attack problem of
                            revising upper house electoral law since next upper house elections
                            would not take place for three years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was in extremely mellow mood
                            and at end of our talks reminisced over great progress which had been
                            made in Japan-American <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0217"
                            />relations since new era was established two years ago in his meeting
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. He
                            recalled many papers he had submitted to us before his Washington visit
                            proposing adjustments in US-Japan relations, including such matters as
                            reduction of US Armed Forces in Japan, Okinawa, Bonins, treaty revision,
                            war criminals, trade relations, etc., and expressed great happiness that
                            while complete solutions had not yet been found to all problems, great
                            progress had been made. Japanese-American relations in his judgement
                            have never been better than at present. He explained that as result of
                            cooperation and understanding which had developed between his government
                            and our government there were no burning or envenomed issues which could
                            be exploited by leftists or neutralists and there were also no issues
                            where Japanese had feeling US was being unreasonable or unresponsive to
                            legitimate Japanese desires. This he said had been an important factor
                            in conservative successes in recent elections.</p>

                                    that if hostilities broke out in Korea under present treaty and

                                    launching active combat operations in hostilities in which we,
                                    but not Japan, are engaged thus committing Japan to acts of

                                <item>In light of above I urgently request reconsideration of this
                                    matter. It is one of such fundamental importance in our whole
                                    relationship with Japan that I think it imperative that we be
                                    clear on it. I must strongly urge that it be taken to President
                                    if necessary. This is a case where we now have and can continue
                                    to have everything we can reasonably expect from this or any
                                    other Japanese Government. If we attempt to stand rigidly on
                                    past positions drawn up when Japan was under occupational status
                                    and totally subservient to and dependent on us, we will
                                    certainly end up not only by losing what we now have but
                                    alienating Japan from us in process.</item>

                                such provision would be subject to misrepresentation by opposition

                                would be able to accept Japanese-proposed Article VIII. I replied
                                that this matter had received most careful and sympathetic
                                consideration in Washington but that it was absolutely impossible
                                for us to accept Japanese proposal for reasons which I had already

                                then asked me again to explain the reasons, which I did in great
                                detail saying that in all frankness Japanese should abandon Article
                                VIII and seek solution through introduction of appropriate phrase

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> asked me if this was our
                            final view on Japanese-proposed Article VIII and I said it was. He then
                            said that he had discussed this matter at length with the Prime Minister
                            and if we could accept Japanese proposal to include phrase “within their
                            constitutional limitations” (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                            2577) he felt that this would be a solution which would be generally
                            accepted in Japan although it was not as good as Japanese-proposed
                            Article VIII.</p>
                        <p>He then explained in detail how important it was to handle this
                            constitutional issue in the new treaty in a way which would be accepted
                            by the majority of Japanese opinion.</p>
                        <p>If issue were not adequately handled in language of new treaty there was
                            grave risk of most serious trouble, not excluding rejection of new
                            treaty. Therefore he and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            both felt it was in our strong interest to work out a compromise
                            solution which would wash in Japan. I said I would enquire most urgently
                            re Washington’s views on above phrase. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> then said that if these proposals were
                            unacceptable he did not see any way out of impasse and asked me if I had
                            any other thoughts. I replied that <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> had mentioned informally to me a possibility
                            which might be worthy of consideration (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                                >Embtel</gloss> 2577). <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> had discussed it with him but that tentatively
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, and legislative experts
                            did not think it would satisfactorily meet Japanese problem. I urged him
                            strongly to reconsider <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName>
                            proposal: “Subject to their constitutional provisions” rather than:

                            special questioning and attack, and in order to prove that Japan has not
                            exceeded limits set by its constitution, very least that would be

                            “maintaining and developing capacity to resist armed attack”) would be

                            was absolutely impossible for us to accept, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"

                                        >Fujiyama</persName>, we will accept addition in Article III
                                    of the following phrase: “in accordance with its constitutional
                                    provisions and processes.” You should point out that this
                                    language identical with phrase used in Article V. Difference of
                                    language in Articles III and <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197"
                                        facs="0227"/>V could give rise during Diet presentation to
                                    question as to difference in interpretation or meaning. We
                                    strongly prefer our language as opposed to that proposed by
                                        <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> since latter emphasizes,
                                    too strongly for purposes of mutuality, that there may be
                                    limitations on assistance to be rendered by either party. While
                                    we recognize this is true in case of Japan, believe Japanese
                                    interests are fully protected under our proposal. If <gloss

                                        <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> preference this language

                                        target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> interpretation of both phrases
                                    and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> insistence based on
                                    phrase which least likely cause political difficulties, you may

                        <p>Our agreement to accept additional language in Article III was reached
                            after long and careful study. One major concern with regard to separate
                            article on constitutionality is that inclusion of reference to
                            constitutional limitations could impair our use of bases in Japan in
                            cases other than direct attack against Japan. Our concern stemmed
                            primarily from Article 9 of Constitution. This could be construed as
                            precluding Japan granting permission to establish bases as well its
                            permission to use bases in circumstances which might be considered as
                            involving Japan in “belligerency.” In this regard Defense not reassured
                            by legal paper submitted by Japanese (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                                >Embtel</gloss> 2577).</p>
                        <p>You should urge upon <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> introductory
                            phrase Article VI as follows: “For the purpose of contributing to the
                            security of Japan and the maintenance of international peace and
                            security in the Far East, etc.” You should stress our strong feeling on
                            this, pointing out that language gives flavor of mutuality which has
                            been greatly reduced in other provisions of treaty and that in fact this
                            language consistent with purposes expressed in present security treaty.
                            However, if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> rejects our language and
                            they assure us that their language would not have different effect than
                            our language on possible use of bases in Far East action, you may accept
                            their proposal as contained in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                                        is no substantive question involved. Accordingly Japanese
                                        felt they could not agree that “Pacific area” should be

                                            Japanese had done utmost to meet our position. They had
                                            dropped their proposal for separate Article VIII which
                                            from their point of view would have been most desirable
                                            and important for both Diet and public discussions. They
                                            had also, with greatest reluctance, dropped insistence
                                            on phraseology referring to constitutional limitations.
                                            However, acceptance of words “in accordance with their
                                            constitutional provisions and processes” in Article III
                                            would simply not meet their problem and they could
                                            therefore not accept it.</p>

                                            capacities to resist armed attack”. These words had
                                            already been singled out in Diet debates as possibly
                                            implying obligation for Japan to expand its defense
                                            establishment beyond what would be necessary for
                                            exercise of inherent right of self-defense. In this
                                            connection Socialists would certainly charge that under
                                            treaty, US would require Japan to build up its war
                                            potential in excess of defense needs. Difficulty in
                                            accepting language we propose (“in accordance with
                                            constitutional provisions, etc.”) stems from absence of
                                            any provision in constitution relating to self-defense
                                            capacity. On contrary there is an absolute prohibition
                                            in Article 9 of constitution against Japan maintaining
                                            land, sea, and air forces as well as other war
                                            potential. While Japanese constitution is interpreted as
                                            not denying inherent right of self-defense, and hence
                                            necessity for self-defense forces, it is legally
                                            impossible to say that such capacity would be maintained
                                            and developed “in accordance with constitutional
                                            provisions” because there is no relevant provision in
                                            constitution. Socialists and others in and out of Diet
                                            would seize on this phrase to make major political
                                            issue. It would be difficult enough with “subject to”
                                            but that would at least minimize political problem.</p>

                                            different substantive meaning from phrase “in accordance
                                            with their constitutional provisions and processes” in
                                            Article V and that it does not in any way negate or
                                            limit undertakings contained in treaty other than fact
                                            that Japan cannot build up its forces beyond what is
                                            necessary for its self-defense.</p></item>

                                I reiterated that I felt we had met them on all important points and
                                if they could not accept above proposal I was quite pessimistic over
                                our being able to reach agreement in near future.</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> expressed appreciation for
                            our effort to meet essential points of Japanese concern. He could not
                            give any “official reaction” as he must put this whole problem to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. One point that gave him
                            immediate concern was whether inclusion in public formula of “in the
                            light of circumstances prevailing at the time” would be interpreted in
                            Japan as qualifying fact that there would be consultation. He said
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would be busy with
                            formation and swearing-in of new cabinet this afternoon and evening but
                            he would put our package proposal to him and try to obtain official
                            reply for us just as soon as he could thereafter.</p>
                        <p>In light of <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s instructions, I
                            purposely omitted any reference to “shuttle bombing,” hoping to give
                            impression that if I did not mention it it was obviously not included in
                            package. <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> made no
                            reference to it. Should he do so at next meeting, I shall tell him it is
                            obviously not possible to cover every possible or imaginable contingency
                            in any agreement and that if he insists on pursuing this matter, then it
                            will reopen entire question of treaty and formula.</p>

                            saw <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> last night to obtain
                            his reaction to the package proposal I had presented previous day.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he had discussed
                            this matter with <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. Since I
                            had indicated that proposal was single package which should be accepted
                            or rejected in toto and not dealt with piece-meal <pb n="202"
                                xml:id="pg_202" facs="0232"/>item by item, he was authorized to
                            inform me that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> accepted all
                            points of substance in the package. There was, however, one point on
                            form which <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> felt it was not
                            possible to accept. This was addition of words “in the light of
                            circumstances prevailing at the time” at end of public formula.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said Prime Minister feels
                            strongly that addition of that phrase would render the entire public
                            formula ambiguous. It would be immediately claimed that we had not
                            really undertaken to consult, and that claim would have some
                            plausibility not only with Socialists but with general public. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and he understood that we had not intended that
                            our proposal take away in last clause what had been given in earlier
                            part of sentence, but such impression would inevitably be created and
                            would greatly impair public acceptability of treaty and consultation
                            formula, creating major trouble for <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> government. Since phrase “in the light of
                            circumstances prevailing at the time” is not really matter of substance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wished me to know that
                            if we would agree to withdraw it we could settle on basis of my package
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Re Article VI, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and he would accept our
                            latest proposal, to have the article begin “For the purpose of
                            contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of
                            international peace and security in the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>Since I had strongly urged inclusion of phrase “in the light of
                            circumstances prevailing at the time” in consultation formula, I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> I would make
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s views known
                            immediately to Washington and hoped to let him know Washington’s

                                >Fujiyama</persName> that we agree to delete the above clause, thus
                            completing agreement on treaty, consultation formula and record of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> explained that while there

                            questions in which other cabinet ministries had an interest thus
                            carrying out his responsibilities to the cabinet. Meeting then turned to
                            discuss question of timing.</p>
                        <p>Consensus of meeting, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            said, was that while it was most important that no announcement re
                            timing should be made at this time (since it would only give aid and
                            comfort to Socialists), new treaty and related documents should be
                            introduced not into extraordinary Diet session but into subsequent
                            regular Diet session which will be convened in December. This is
                            necessary for reasons of parliamentary tactics and time schedule
                            necessitated by constitutional provisions. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said Vietnamese reparations agreement, which
                            was signed May 13, must <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0235"/>take
                            precedence in ratification process over new security treaty. Cabinet and
                            party leaders have decided that it would be most unwise for <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to sign treaty or introduce it into
                            Diet while Vietnamese agreement is being debated. In view strong
                            Socialist opposition to any agreement with South Vietnam, extraordinary
                            Diet session in autumn will inevitably spend considerable time on that
                            agreement and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> wishes that issue to
                            be safely out of the way before engaging final battle over security
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>In terms of parliamentary calendar, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            strategy has in mind article 61 of constitution which provides that a
                            treaty becomes effective 30 days after passage by lower house,
                            regardless whether it has been approved by upper house. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is calculating that for Vietnamese
                            reparations agreement to become effective it must allow 40 days for
                            lower house debate, followed by period of 30 days during which it can be
                            debated in upper house. Since extraordinary Diet must close by December
                            10 or December 15 at the very latest, Vietnamese reparations agreement
                            must therefore be introduced toward end of September at the latest. In
                            light of fact that ratification of Vietnamese agreement will thus take
                            about 70 days if the US-Japan security treaty were to be introduced into
                            extraordinary Diet, session would have had to be convoked very shortly
                            after <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s return and even then
                            might not complete action on both Vietnamese accord and security treaty
                            by mid-December. Furthermore, party leaders have judged that such
                            extended extraordinary session would be unwise and that such tight
                            schedule might have involved excessive risk of being upset by opposition
                            maneuvers. It would be better, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> reported, to introduce new treaty and <gloss
                                target="#t_Admin1">Admin</gloss> Agreement into regular Diet session
                            which will be convoked latter half Dec, which will then recess for one
                            month and get down to business in latter half of January.</p>
                        <p>Under this time schedule, <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            said, it is envisioned that new treaty and related agreements could be
                            signed some time between end of extraordinary Diet in early or
                            mid-December and convocation of regular Diet later that month or
                            possibly during Diet recess from late December to late January.
                            Signature during extraordinary session would risk entangling new treaty
                            with acrimonious debate over Vietnamese reparations. Japanese still
                            believed signature in Washington preferable. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said he was personally considering possibility
                            of our initialing all the agreed documents at an earlier time if this
                            seemed indicated but he had not discussed such a possibility with either
                            cabinet or party. </p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he greatly regretted
                            inability to sign new treaty in July as he had hoped, and apologized for
                            heavy pressure of work that had been placed on Washington and Embassy in
                            hope of completing negotiations <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0236"
                            />prior to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s departure. He
                            said he hoped we could continue negotiations on the few remaining issues
                            at steady pace in next few weeks. </p>
                        <p>I urged <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> to use delay of
                            signature to initiate major positive campaign of public enlightenment to
                            counter Socialist and Communist misrepresentations about the new treaty
                            and to marshal public opinion in favor of ratification. I said
                            Communists and Communist-influenced groups were prepared to make treaty
                            revision a battleground which would determine Japan’s future for many
                            years and that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> exertions must be
                            adequate to this challenge. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said he fully agreed and intended make every
                            effort in weeks ahead to rally public support behind new treaty. </p>

                        <p>The Ambassador had told Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> he would like to call on him following the
                            reorganization of the Cabinet, but at the Minister’s request the meeting
                            was held at the Residence in order to avoid the press. At the outset
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> indicated that he
                            would like to speak confidentially, as always, to the Ambassador and he
                            dismissed his interpreter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> that
                            he would like to talk to him as a friend regarding a number of problems
                            which were troubling him. He then discussed Japanese restrictions
                            against 1) imports of American capital, 2) technological agreements and
                            3) imports of automobiles for American businessmen. The Ambassador
                            stressed that it was not just simply a matter of protecting American
                            interests, which it was his duty to do, but that the restrictionist
                            attitudes of Japanese bureaucrats on these matters made it difficult for
                            the United States to cooperate in fighting the proponents of
                            protectionism in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> replied that while he
                            understood the Ambassador’s viewpoint, one of the problems that he faced
                            was the large imbalance between imports from the United States and
                            exports to the United States. The Minister said that he would be going
                            to Washington on September 24 to attend the IMF meeting and he had a
                            number of problems that he would discuss at that time. One of them was
                            this problem. It was not his intention to see imports and exports with
                            the United States in balance, since they had never been so from Meiji
                            times on, but he wished to see a closer balance achieved, especially
                            since Japan must think in the long term when it might not have large
                            special dollar earnings from United States military sources etc. In
                            respect to restrictions on cars, the amount involved was small, the
                            Minister noted, but he hoped that Japan would move in the direction of
                            free convertibility when its foreign exchange position improved. Japan
                            now has $1, 100,000,000 in foreign exchange but cannot convert it at
                            will. Recently there have been moves to unblock some of the earnings of
                            foreign motion picture companies as well as to relax restrictions on
                            remittances from Japanese emigrants abroad. He hoped the day would soon
                            come when Japan would be able to have a freer foreign exchange as exists
                            in Western Europe. The Ambassador explained that the dollars for the
                            import of cars by the American business community were not Japanese
                            dollars but dollars held in the United States by the American
                            businessmen.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> that
                            the United States is doing its best to help Japan expand its markets
                            abroad to carry on the trade that is the nation’s life blood. But
                            cooperation must be a two-way street. If the <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208"
                                facs="0238"/>problems the Ambassador had raised seemed minor, they
                            nonetheless were aggravating some of Japan’s best friends in America and
                            in the American business community in Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he was grateful for the assistance the United
                            States had given Japan through its financing of the World Bank and in
                            helping Japan to float its dollar bond issue in the United States.
                            However, a limit was being approached in the amount of capital available
                            for investment in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Leaving aside
                            Southeast Asia, the problem is particularly acute in Latin America. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> inquired as to what
                            policies the United States had in mind to extend credit in Latin America
                            and hoped that Japan could take, advantage of such credit. He said that
                            he would make this point when he visited Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> thoroughly agreed with the
                            Ambassador that cooperation with the United States must be a two-way
                            street. He said that as a result of the reorganization of the Cabinet
                            the United States could rely 100% on Japan and that especially he and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> were of the same opinion
                            as his “boss,” former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS2"
                                >Yoshida</persName>, that the United States should regard Japan as
                            its “follower” and should lead Japan.</p>
                        <p>For example, before his departure Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had talked to the Cabinet about
                            the Korean repatriation problem. He pointed out in clear-cut terms that
                            without the cooperation of the United States and the Ambassador, Japan
                            would never be able to solve its problems with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. From time to time, Japan’s policies
                            might seem to change somewhat, but the Ambassador should understand that
                            Japan will never deviate from its basic alignment with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the United States needs Japan and Japan needs
                            the United States. He was glad to see that exports from Japan to the
                            United States had increased 50% over last year in the first five months
                            of 1959, but he hoped that the increase would not proceed at too swift a
                            rate lest it invite restrictionist measures by United States industries.
                            Japan should be thinking about protecting the 30% of Japan’s total
                            exports that now go to the United States and work for a gradual rather
                            than spectacular and immediate increase in exports to the United States.
                            Moreover these exports were consumer goods, many of them in the luxury
                            class, that would find no ready market in Southeast Asia or the
                            Communist Bloc. The important thing was not to let small matters stand
                            in the way of cooperation on big problems. It was with this thought in
                            mind that the Ambassador had spoken so frankly on the question of
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would look into the question of financing in
                            Latin America and Southeast Asia. He said he understood the United
                            States would contribute to Latin American economic development through
                            the Inter-American Bank. The United States will put <pb n="209"
                                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0239"/>money into the bank but it will not
                            control it. The United States Export-Import Bank in turn is limited in
                            scope and intended to finance United States exports.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in Southeast Asia the United States cannot just
                            give Japan capital but is prepared to assist when a good project is
                            presented for consideration such as the Orissa Iron ore project in India
                            or give sympathetic consideration as in the case of the Bailadila
                            project. For the next few years the best thing for Japan and another
                            Asian country or countries to do will be to propose specific sound
                            projects in which case the United States will sympathetically consider
                            the possibility of assisting in the financing, perhaps from the
                            Development Loan Fund. The United States does not look favorably on a
                            blanket loan to Japan or an Asian country simply to finance the export
                            of Japanese capital goods and equipment.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that in
                            Indonesia the Japanese are able to take advantage of the reparations
                            agreement as a means of facilitating investment. In Brazil, however,
                            where $200,000,000 has already been committed/a limit has been reached
                            in available capital. Japan is already involved in the Minas Gerais
                            steel mill project and a dockyard, but is trying to enter into an
                            electric power development project. He hoped that the Second World Bank
                            would set up with Latin America in mind but was convinced that the bank
                            would not be of much help in Southeast Asia where Japan must think of
                            another system.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thought that the reparations agreements which now call for
                            about $1, 200,000,000 in direct aid and sympathetic consideration for
                            another $700 million in loans would be of great help. There is no
                            conflict between Japan and the United States, but rather it is in the
                            interests of each country to work with the other.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then mentioned the
                            Security Treaty negotiations and expressed concern over the lack of
                            progress with the Treaty despite the Ambassador’s good will and hard
                            work. Before Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            had left on his trip the latter had made it clear that the Treaty was to
                            be put through. Starting next week there will be full discussions
                            regarding the Treaty under the guidance of <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> among the Cabinet ministers in Tokyo. Moreover,
                            thought will be given to the countermeasures that must be taken to
                            overcome the opposition campaign by Sohyo.</p>
                        <p>Because the fall Emergency Diet Session will be concerned with the
                            Vietnamese reparations question, <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> said it will be difficult to present the Security
                            Treaty for ratification at that time. Therefore, the Regular Diet
                            Session will concentrate on the budget and the Security Treaty. The
                            government is firmly resolved to put the Treaty through, if necessary
                            taking advantage of the provision for automatic ratification once the
                            Treaty is approved by the Lower House. In the meantime, an extensive
                            public relations campaign will be undertaken to explain the Treaty. The
                                <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0240"/>Ambassador should have
                            confidence that his efforts on behalf of the Treaty will not be
                            undermined.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it was not the United States that had proposed
                            the revision of the Treaty and now that Japan had entered into
                            negotiations the issue was much more than the contents of the Treaty
                            itself. The communists were determined to make the Treaty a basic issue
                            as to Japan’s future policy and to use it to push neutralism and shake
                            Japan’s basic Western alignment. Recently, Ambassador Fedorenko <note
                                n="1" xml:id="d91fn1">Soviet Ambassador to Japan.</note> had told
                            the Ambassador that he had given up his plans to leave on vacation in
                            early July and return in September. Now he was going to go home for a
                            few weeks in August and come back quickly because “he had work to do”.
                            By this, of course, he means to help those who are opposing the Treaty.
                            Thus, the question of approval of the Treaty is a test of the future
                            international course that Japan plans to take.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that some people
                            thought that the movement against the Treaty would reach greater
                            proportions than that against the Police Bill. He did not agree and was
                            convinced that it would not go beyond the communists and their friends.
                            There was no chance that it would develop into a genuine “people’s
                            movement.” He realized, however, that a public relations campaign was
                            necessary and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> were thinking in these terms. Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> pointed out that however
                            hard the left-wingers worked on the theme of neutralism it has no appeal
                            to the Japanese people. This would be clear in any general election. For
                            one thing, the question of the Security Treaty is not related by the
                            average Japanese to his daily life. For this very reason, however, a
                            positive approach is necessary to explain the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador added that he thoroughly agreed in the need for adequate
                            explanation of the Treaty to the public.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by the Ambassador regarding Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>’s plans to go abroad, the Minister
                            said that he does not know whether or not he is going to the United
                            States but that he would probably not go to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Just before coming to the Residence, Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he heard that Mr.
                            and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>, together with about
                            30 persons have been invited to Hawaii by the Hawaiian Dredging Company.
                            He said that the Finance Ministry was concerned over the number of
                            people invited who all had asked for substantial dollar exchange and was
                            debating whether or nor to give them the dollars. The Minister had
                            recently talked to a commentator about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI4"
                                >Kono</persName>’s attitude toward the United States. The
                            commentator thought that he is lacking in moral courage, and that his
                            attitude toward the United States was shaped during the Occupation when
                            he was held as a war criminal and when he was purged and lost <pb
                                n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0241"/>his job. The Minister added
                            that he did not see much of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI4"
                                >Kono</persName> these days.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was aware that there was a general impression
                            that he was unfriendly to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI4"
                            >Kono</persName>. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>
                            had gone to the United States two years ago, he had simply warned him
                            that he would not be able to negotiate foreign policy problems outside
                            of the usual channels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            said that this was the “<persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName>
                            method” of working outside the usual channels.</p>
                        <p>According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> had originally thought
                            that the Security Treaty should receive long and careful study. Now he
                            felt that if it is a Treaty that will deepen friendship with the United
                            States then it is a good Treaty. If it is not such a Treaty, it will be
                            a bad Treaty. The Ambassador mentioned that recently a Japanese friend
                            had suggested that perhaps it had been wrong for the Japanese Government
                            to have asked for a change in the Treaty. The Ambassador replied that
                            even if this were the case, if he did not support the Treaty now, he
                            would be supporting the communists whose objective is to defeat the
                            Treaty. His friend acknowledged that he had not thought of the matter in
                            this way.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out the great change that has taken place in the
                            power ratio in the Pacific area compared to before the war when the
                            United States and Japan were the only two major powers in the area. Now,
                            both Japan and Germany had disappeared from the scene as powers to check
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover, Communist China had
                            developed as a Pacific Power. Japan by itself lacks the resources to
                            combat these two great powers. This is an argument for the Security
                            Treaty that many Japanese have made to the Ambassador. If those who
                            would use force to achieve their ends know that they will face the
                            deterrent force, not only of Japan, but of the United States, they will
                            hesitate to attack Japan. Moreover the other Free World nations in Asia
                            will thereby benefit.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said he would like to
                            speak briefly about the political situation, which is quiet at the
                            moment. He is personally friendly with Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName> and Ohno but their ideology is
                            totally different from that of himself and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>. A cold war consequently exists
                            between the two sides. <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName> and
                            Ohno have indicated that they believe that the new Security Treaty is
                            necessary for Japan and have said that they will cooperate to see that
                            it is approved. What form their cooperation will take is a dubious
                            question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said the press has noted the
                            plans of the ultra-rightists to counter the attacks on the Treaty of the
                            left wing. He added that the ultra-rightists have no ideals of their own
                            and hope only to upset law and order. In so doing the onus will be
                            placed on the Government. He is doing his best to discourage such
                            efforts but suspects that they are inspired behind the scenes by

                        <p>Returning to the question of the import of automobiles, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> pointed out that even Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> had been unable
                            to purchase a Benz from Germany as he said he had intended to do when he
                            visited there. Since that time <gloss target="#t_MITI1">MITI</gloss> has
                            refused to give him permission. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> said there is now talk that he will receive one as
                            a present from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>.) He
                            was, however, under the impression that there was no problem for
                            American businessmen.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador reiterated that the cars in question were for responsible
                            American businessmen and would be imported with American dollars,
                            thereby incurring no drain on Japanese foreign exchange, and that the
                            businessmen would abide by any reasonable rules regarding their resale.
                            It was now impossible to bring in a car because the Japanese Government
                            requires that the owner have had previous possession for one year and
                            has attached other unreasonable conditions. Obviously an American in
                            Japan has no opportunity to exercise such ownership. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> said that he did not realize that
                            this was the situation and did not know that the dollars were not
                            Japanese dollars. He would look into the matter and hoped that the
                            regulations would be changed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he hoped to be able to have another friendly
                            exchange of views with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>,
                            perhaps at the end of August.</p>

                        <p>The Diet debates so far have disclosed not only the fundamental positions
                            of Government and opposition but also some detailed elements of the new
                            Mutual Security Treaty and related documents and the precise lines of
                            attack against them.</p>
                        <p>The principal issues at present concern the consultation formula (whether
                            consultation means agreement and, if so, why it is not so stated); the
                            duration of the treaty (whether a shorter duration than ten years would
                            not preferable); the Vandenberg Resolution article (whether a
                            constitutional safeguard phrase can overcome the doubts about
                            constitutionality of the entire treaty); attacks against American bases
                            in Japan (whether it is reasonable to bring the treaty into operation in
                            such a case even if, hypothetically, Japan was not an intended victim);
                            the phrase “peace and security in the Far East" (whether this would tend
                            to justify American military operations outside the treaty area, and
                            would call for Japanese acquiescence in such operations by virtue of
                            such language); and the provisions of the Administrative Agreement
                            dealing with customs, labor and rights outside of military facilities
                            and areas.</p>
                        <p>As regards the present relations between Government and opposition, the
                            above catalogue probably lists the principal issues in order of their
                            importance, but that order may well have changed by the time the <pb
                                n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0244"/>ratification debate actually
                            begins. Both the relative rankings and the principal arguments
                            concerning each issue may still undergo considerable change,
                            particularly if the opposition is encouraged by dissension within the
                            Liberal Democratic Party concerning any of these issues.</p>

                        <p>548. I had long talk with <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            August 25 during which I stressed seriousness of certain recent alarming

                                had a conversation concerning Japanese restrictions on U.S.

                            up with cabinet on most urgent basis because this is matter that goes to
                            very heart of Japan-US relationship and if serious disputes develop over
                            trade between us, all our other relationships will suffer. I told

                        <p>I pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> that USG
                            under personal leadership of President has worked very hard to resist
                            restrictionist tendencies and that we have welcomed orderly expansion of
                            Japanese exports to US because we appreciate that Japan must trade to
                            live and that entire future of Japan is bound up with future of its
                            trade with free world. I recalled how precipitate expansion in certain
                            lines undercut ability of administration to counter restrictionist
                            pressures, as in case of cotton textile crisis in 1956.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d94fn2">This crisis was resolved when the United States
                                accepted a Japanese decision to initiate a 5–year program to control
                                textile exports. (<hi rend="italic">Current Economic
                                    Developments</hi>, January 22, 1957, pp. 13–16) Documents
                                concerning discussions during 1958–1960 on textile issues are in

                                411.949.</note> During last six months, I said, Japanese merchandise
                            exports to US have increased 51 percent over same period last year which
                            was previous all-time high of Japanese exports to US. At same time total
                            of Japanese exports to other countries had slightly declined by about
                            one half percent. I said on some items Japanese exports to US last year
                            increased so sharply that they would invite restrictionist reaction.</p>
                        <p>While Japanese exports to U S had thus sharply increased during first
                            half of 1959, I continued, Japanese merchandise imports from US declined
                            by 2.5 percent but at same time total Japanese imports from other
                            countries increased by 17 percent. Furthermore, during first six months
                            of this year the United States has for first time in post-war history
                            had an adverse balance in its trade with Japan. In addition US military
                            spending and off-shore procurement in Japan is running thus far this
                            year at rate of over $400 million which greatly aids Japan.</p>
                        <p>The over-all situation is giving me grave concern, I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>, for a number of reasons. In
                            first place US Congress will be strongly impressed by figures I had
                            given him and by industry charges that Japan is flooding the US market,
                            unless Japan urgently takes measures to improve situation. In addition
                            to charges by US industry, there is growing concern on the part of US
                            labor. AFL–CIO, which traditionally has supported liberal US trade
                            policy, is now reported giving serious consideration for first time to
                            reversal of US policy, demanding tariff protection and imposition of
                            quotas against low-priced imports. Such shift in position of organized
                            labor will add great strength to efforts of individual industries to
                            secure tariff protection. Problem is made still more threatening for
                            Japan, I continued, by fact that nobody can deny that Japan itself is
                            practicing discrimination and restrictionism with <pb n="216"

                        <p>Situation must be viewed as extremely serious and decisive steps must be
                            taken by Japan, and taken quickly to counter the rapidly growing
                            sentiment in US favoring restrictions on Japanese imports by adopting
                            orderly marketing procedures and abandoning restrictive practices
                            against US industry. Among measures which Japan would urgently consider
                            are following: <list>

                                        Japan’s import licensing and foreign exchange allocation
                                        system, which serves to restrict trade. This warranted by
                                        Japan’s improved balance of payments position. (B) Japan’s
                                        discrimination against American goods, which though small
                                        quantitatively, is an irritant to sound trade relations.
                                        Discrimination exists in certain products (e.g., hides and
                                        skins, beef, tallow, lard, soybeans, scrap iron and steel,
                                        copper scrap). Discrimination also exists by virtue of
                                        bilateral trade agreements with certain other countries.</p>
                                    <p>I said that in past restrictions upon US imports may have
                                        been justified on basis balance of payments situation but
                                        Japan now has built up greatest foreign reserves in its
                                        history. Removal of discrimination and loosening of
                                        restrictions may not result in large quantitative increase
                                        imports from US, but it would have disproportionately good
                                        effect in terms of over-all picture and also by way of
                                        improving Japan’s position in forthcoming <gloss

                                        involves direct discrimination against US. Also
                                        unwillingness to permit importation of US automobiles by
                                        American businessmen in Japan who are prepared to use their
                                        own foreign exchange holdings, pay Japanese customs duties
                                        and abide by restrictions on re-sale, was setting against
                                        Japan the very elements who could be most active in

                                    to unnecessary and justified resentment, again on part of very
                                    US interests which should be Japan’s allies <pb n="217"
                                        xml:id="pg_217" facs="0247"/>against restrictionists in US.
                                    Since Japan has made such remarkable economic progress in recent
                                    years there should no longer be fear that US capital entering
                                    Japanese economy could dominate any industry. In conclusion I
                                    said I had spoken with great frankness because I could not think
                                    of anything more important to relations between our countries
                                    than solid trading relationship based on good faith, and it
                                    would not be fair to conceal it is heading for very dangerous
                                    crisis, if necessary steps are not taken. If there is
                                    liberalization on Japanese side and if steps are taken to put
                                    marketing in US on more orderly basis, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> would have much better arguments than a present
                                    to answer charges of American industry and would have more
                                    allies within US in resisting efforts to place restrictions on
                                    Japanese imports. Moreover USG itself cannot effectively resist
                                    restrictionist tendencies unless <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                        >GOJ</gloss> shows that it is earnestly willing to remove
                                    unfair obstacles and modify practices which have given rise to
                                    legitimate complaints. In other words liberal trade policies are
                                    and must be a two way street.</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he appreciated
                            frankness of my presentation and attached greatest importance to
                            information I had given him about increasingly acute restrictionist
                            pressures in US. Question of trade liberalization he said is most
                            important economic policy problem. Unprecedented “jimmu” prosperity of
                            two years ago, he said, had produced severe dislocations within Japanese
                            economy and although foreign exchange position has greatly improved
                            there is fear in certain governmental circles that this only temporary
                            and that situation would rapidly deteriorate if restrictions were
                            lifted. He said there is important body of opinion that liberalization
                            would severely reduce dollar availabilities and that Japan must continue
                            very “cautious” policy. As for himself, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said, he did not necessarily share such
                            opinions and he would take matter up on most urgent basis with <persName

                                >Sato</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> and
                            top party officials and he welcomed my talking to them also as I had
                            told him I intended to do.</p>
                        <p>As regards “directed” dollar allocations, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said, they had been regarded as inevitable
                            because there are countries which will not buy from Japan unless Japan
                            also buys from them, and importers often will not buy from such
                            countries unless forced to do so because their prices are too high. In
                            case of US, Canada, and Australia, Japan is already importing very
                            substantial amounts so that similar channeling of imports had been
                            necessary. If foreign exchange situation improves, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> might resort to extension of credits
                            and other means to improve situation for countries whose trade positions
                            are not too strong. Up to now it has not been felt safe to extend such
                            credits on a large scale. As for automobile situation, restrictions had
                            doubtless been largely based on protectionist policy, but now that
                            Japanese car exports are increasing time has come to re-examine
                            situation. As for capital imports, there has <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"
                                facs="0248"/>been fear that introduction US capital would lead to
                            “collapse” or takeover of Japanese industries, but such feelings have
                            become less widespread and less intense and <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> personally felt time has come to open doors
                            although this may have to be on a selective basis.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> concluded by saying he
                            would discuss entire range of questions I had raised on most urgent
                            basis with his colleagues and he hoped be able talk with me in near
                            future about measures that might be taken to avoid US restrictionist
                            moves.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> indicated separately that while
                            they had not realized situation was so serious they had themselves been
                            contemplating possibility of certain steps toward liberalization. These
                            might take time and would create difficulties but in view of my
                            presentation they agreed the matter would be discussed within <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> on urgent basis. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> said he hoped but could not
                            promise that Japan would be able to announce before <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> meeting that it would carry out
                            certain liberalization measures as he agreed this would have favorable
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>I put the problem very strongly to above ministers and believe that we
                            can induce <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to take at least some
                            liberalization steps although a bit of time may be required. It would be
                            very helpful if Department would call in <persName corresp="#p_AK5"
                                >Asakai</persName> and stress to him along above lines graveness of
                            present situation and absolute necessity for Japan to make
                            liberalization steps and modify restrictionist policies if we are
                            expected to be able to hold the line against restrictionist pressures in
                            US. Similarly I hope that points in my presentation to Fujiyuma will be

                            visit” with all trappings and ceremonies but that in addition to signing
                            treaty it would afford <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> opportunity to meet with
                            President to get President’s views on world situation. This, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> thought, was particularly
                            important because with exchange of visits with Khrushchev, activities of
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and developments in
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> (Laos), first-hand knowledge of
                            President’s views would be of inestimable value to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and him. Furthermore he intimated
                            that a meeting with the President would also bolster <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s position. I gather <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> feels that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> signs treaty in Washington and
                            meets with President it will not only consolidate different factions of
                            Conservative Party behind <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            prior to introduction of new treaty into Diet in January but will also
                            consolidate substantial majority of over-all Japanese opinion in support
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s treaty revision and
                            overall policy of close cooperation with U.S. <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> said that while <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> has not reached decision on whether to come to
                            Washington to sign treaty, he is seriously considering it.</p>
                        <p>It is of course up to the Japanese to decide who will sign the treaty for
                            them. My own view is that if <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            decides to come it is very strongly in our own interest that we should
                            welcome such move. As you know, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> admires and respects President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> more than any other
                            statesman in world and the President’s views have a real impact on him.
                            At same time, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has been
                            staunch and loyal friend and despite outcries and vicious attacks from
                            Moscow, Peking, Japanese Socialist Party and all leftist elements in
                            Japan designed to pressure <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            into loosening the close ties between Japan and U.S., <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has stood firmly on his policy
                            that closest possible cooperation with U.S. in all fields is essential
                            to Japan. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, of course, has
                            had to deal not only with the left but also with opportunistic elements
                            within his own party. It would certainly be to our great advantage to do
                            anything we reasonably can to strengthen his position within and outside
                            his party and at same time encourage his policy of firmness towards the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>But perhaps most important immediate effect of such a visit in December
                            would be to strengthen his hand with respect to treaty revision. Now
                            that Communists have made treaty revision basic issue of Japan’s
                            alignment and are using every weapon in their well-stocked arsenal to
                            force <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to abandon treaty revision or
                            to defeat treaty if it submitted to Diet, it is important that we give
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> all the support we
                            reasonably can to help him get treaty through. He and his Govt of course
                            are determined to push treaty through Diet, but if they should fail, all
                            our present security relationships and arrangements with Japan would be
                            undermined and threatened.</p>
                        <p>At present there are no really major controversial issues between <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and ourselves and the few but important
                            remaining issues in connection with security treaty and related
                            documents will be cleared up before signature. Therefore <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would not be coming to Washington
                            to raise new issues which would involve substantial preparatory work for
                            President and yourself but would be coming simply to sign treaty and use
                            that occasion for a very good and useful discussion with President on
                            the world situation. Burdens of entertainment need not be great and I
                            believe that one meal at White House, which could be luncheon, and a
                            formal dinner by you or the Vice President for Japanese signatories
                            would be all that would be required.</p>
                        <p>Japan is of course only positive element of free world strength we have
                            in this vitally important part of world and in <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> we have staunch friend and ally
                            who will need badly whatever support and help we can give him in
                            critical debates which will open in Diet latter part of January. Our
                            cooperation is particularly important with <persName corresp="#p_IT2"
                                >Ishibashi</persName>, Matsumura, <persName corresp="#p_MT3"

                            making pilgrimages to Peking and Moscow, etc. For all above reasons I
                            hope most earnestly that you and President will give this matter

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> about the
                            possibility of a visit to Japan by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> next year to commemorate the 100th
                            anniversary of U.S.-Japanese diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>While I, of course, fully realize from my days in the Department when I
                            personally worked with the White House staff in making arrangements for
                            two of the President’s trips abroad, the many problems visits to foreign
                            countries raise for the President, it would be a splendid and indeed
                            superb thing if the President could visit Japan. I have in mind that
                            following his visit to Moscow he might return to the United States via
                            Japan and the Pacific. If time were a factor he would not have to stay
                            in Japan more than two days and indeed in a pinch 36 hours would
                            probably do the trick. Since it is the 100th anniversary of
                            U.S.-Japanese relations and in view of the tremendous importance of
                            Japan as the only real element of positive free world strength in all of
                            Asia it would be, it seems to me, most appropriate for him to stop over
                            here. If it were treated as a stop-over visit on the occasion of the
                            100th anniversary of U.S.-Japanese relations following the Moscow trip,
                            it seems to me we would have a good argument to rebut any other friendly
                            Asian country that might also wish to have the President visit their
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I do hope that the President will be able to consider at least the
                            possibility of such a stop-over in Japan. Next year will be the most
                            critical year for U.S.-Japanese relations since the end of the war, and
                            depending on what happens we will either move forward into even closer
                            association or the links which we have forged will begin to loosen. A
                            visit by the President would of course help greatly to bolster those
                            Japanese leaders who are our friends, who believe that the closest
                            possible cooperative relations with the United States are of basic
                            importance to Japan’s future, and who are struggling to counter the
                            accelerating Sino-Soviet campaign to neutralize and isolate Japan.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that we succeed in creating a public image here that United
                            States interests in the Far East are not secondary to United States
                            interests in Europe and that the United States attaches equal importance
                            to its alliance with Japan as it does to West Germany or other <gloss

                            <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0254"/>countries, the more we shall
                            strengthen our friends here and ensure the stability and the
                            strengthening of U.S.-Japanese relations. In this respect, you might
                            wish to tell the President that in my judgment no single thing the
                            United States could do would have as great an impact on the-Japanese
                            nation and people as a visit by him.</p>

                                considerable discussion within party whether “consultation” means

                                (see paragraph 23 of enclosure to Embassy despatch 482) has now

                                should seek to substitute word “agreement” for “consultation” but at
                                same time recommended that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                                obtain some understanding from US to make sure that public
                                interpretations given by US and Japan do not differ. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said he was not looking for
                                any written understanding but wanted us to know that if <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is asked whether US would be able
                                to take actions (introduction of nuclear weapons or direct launching
                                of combat operations from Japan) without Japanese agreement, <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would reply that such eventuality
                                is inconceivable; that US and Japan are like-minded free nations and
                                would be consulting in order to arrive at common agreed view; and
                                that therefore US would clearly not act in opposition to Japanese
                                views in cases covered by consultation formula.</item>

                                islands are not in treaty area, Japan would not be barred from
                                contributing to safety of islanders in event of an emergency
                                although any such contribution would of course have to be made only
                                after consultation with US which has defense responsibility.

                                he did not have in mind any new agreement but he may propose to us
                                that a statement by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, expressing

                                in a negotiating minute to satisfy this requirement placed upon him

                                party was concerned over haziness in term “Far East” which appears
                                in three places in our treaty draft. He said it was not necessary in
                                his view that we formalize any agreed interpretation of that term
                                but he had to give assurances that there would be no divergence in
                                definition or public interpretation of word “Far East” as given by
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in Japanese Diet and by USG
                                in our Congress. Accordingly he said he would appreciate if we could
                                let him know how we would propose to answer questions about precise
                                geographical extent of “Far East” if such questions were to arise in
                                our Congress. Request Department views on how questions about extent
                                of “Far East” would be answered.</item>

                        <p>In opening the conference, Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> stated that today the Japanese Government would be
                            presenting to the Diet its supplementary program for typhoon disaster
                            relief. The Minister expressed his appreciation on behalf of the
                            Japanese Government and the Japanese people for the generous assistance
                            given by the United States Government and the American people in
                            alleviating the suffering and damage caused by this national disaster.
                            In responding, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            expressed his appreciation to the Minister for making time available for
                            the conference, since it was obvious that the pressure of the Minister’s
                            official responsibilities were very great at this time. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he had been looking
                            forward to his visit in Japan for a long time. He continued that he had
                            two matters on which he would like to continue discussion with the
                            Minister. The first of these was trade liberalization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that in his
                            calls on the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, and in his speech

                            <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0257"/>he had discussed trade
                            liberalization, which was, of course, the main business issue of his
                            current visit to Japan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> continued that everyone had been pleased and
                            happy about the general theme of the recent policy announcements that
                            the Government of Japan would do its best to eliminate dollar
                            discrimination and try also to liberalize its overall trade policy by
                            beginning to reduce trade restrictions. As a policy announcement of
                            intention, this was fine. However, the Government of the United States
                            is concerned about the timing and the extent of the liberalization steps
                            which may be taken.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> responded at this
                            point by saying that with regard to timing he had found, upon his return
                            from the United States, that preparations had been lagging somewhat. He
                            had discussed the matter with Mr. <persName>Sakai</persName>, Chief of
                            the Ministry’s Foreign Exchange Bureau, and indicated to Mr.
                                <persName>Sakai</persName> his belief that things were moving a
                            little more slowly than he had expected. The Minister left the
                            implication that he had asked the Ministry’s staff to speed up the work.
                            With respect to the extent of liberalization which the US Government has
                            in mind, he inquired whether the Under Secretary had any concrete
                            ideas.</p>
                        <p>In responding to this question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> outlined what he termed a basic problem of the US
                            Government. He reminded the Minister that at the tariff negotiations
                            under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> auspices at Geneva, Torquay
                            and Annecy, the United States Government had made substantial tariff
                            concessions. The reciprocal concessions which had been received from
                            other <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> members were, in many areas,
                            actually nullified because of quotas imposed for balance of payments
                            reasons. In those earlier days it was not too difficult for the
                            Administration to explain to the U.S. Congress and the people that
                            although a number of the concessions received were not immediately
                            effective, when the entire transitional process was finished the United
                            States would have the full benefit of the concessions granted. In the
                            past year or one and one-half years, conditions have changed
                            substantially. The International Monetary Fund has now reached a
                            decision that there are no longer any justifiable balance-of-payments
                            reasons for currency discrimination, particularly discrimination against
                            the dollar. The generally improved economic situation throughout the
                            world has coincided with a very large increase in imports into the
                            United States, and these factors have resulted in a substantial
                            balance-of-payments deficit for the United States. There has, therefore,
                            developed among members of the public in the United States and the
                            Congress the feeling that trade restrictions, particularly
                            discrimination against the dollar, must be removed very quickly. Unless
                            this is done, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated,
                            the Congress would probably take action on its own to cut back imports
                            into the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0258"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> responded that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had
                            already made these points very clearly in earlier talks on the same
                                subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">See <ref target="#d94">Document
                                    94</ref>.</note> The Government of Japan agrees with the views
                            expressed by the Under Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> continued that the
                            pressure of public opinion in the United States is such that, in his
                            judgment, discrimination against the dollar must be removed by next
                            spring. The United States Government had understood from the Japanese
                            announcements that the complete removal of discrimination against the
                            dollar might not be effected until the spring of 1961. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that in his opinion such
                            a target date was too far away, and that action to eliminate dollar
                            discrimination must be completed by early next spring. Next year is an
                            election year in the United States. If the Congress takes action in this
                            area, it is likely that such action would be stronger than either the
                            Japanese Government or the United States Government would wish to see,
                            but once taken it would be extremely difficult to reverse. In the
                            absence of positive action by the Government of Japan, the
                            Administration would have no effective means with which to withstand
                            pressures for congressional action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> noted that in the area of removal of over-all
                            trade restrictions, as contrasted with discrimination against the
                            dollar, it might take a little longer to work out an effective program.
                            However, in this area it is important that Japan not lag too far behind
                            other countries. The United States has been highly gratified in its
                            talks on general liberalization with other countries. Many of these
                            countries are taking significant action to free their trade from
                            restrictions and further significant improvement is expected to take
                            place within the next six months.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> then inquired what
                            kind of announcement with regard to liberalization would be significant
                            enough to impress the U.S. Congress. Would such an announcement have to
                            include, for example, soybeans and scrap iron? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said effective action would mean
                            that dollar discrimination would be eliminated for the bulk of the
                            commodities against which it is now practiced. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that there might be one or
                            two commodities concerning which there might be particularly difficult
                            or special problems. It might be necessary to put these into a different
                            framework, that is global quotas instead of completely free importation
                            from all sources. The important thing is that Japan eliminate
                            discrimination against dollar goods. In responding, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> stated that he fully understood the
                            Under Secretary’s precaution. He agreed that the timing target date for
                            completion by March 1961 was too late. However, as he had explained to
                            the Ambassador, that particular date had been fixed by taking into
                            consideration all possible factors <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229"
                                facs="0259"/>that might arise. The intention of the Government of
                            Japan is to complete its preparation for making these changes during the
                            remainder of the current fiscal year, so that action could be taken
                            beginning with the commencement of the next fiscal year, April 1,
                            1960.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then referred to his
                            talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">The meeting with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> is described in
                                telegram 1289 from Tokyo, October 26. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 110.12–DI/10–2659)</note> in which the latter had emphasized
                            that Japan must be cautious and could not afford to dissipate its
                            foreign exchange resources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> urged that Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> and his Cabinet colleagues think very carefully
                            about this proposition. Although such a policy of slow and careful
                            action might appear to be cautious, in fact it might actually be
                            dangerous or even reckless. The lack of effective action in Japan might
                            result in restrictive action in the United States, the cost of which
                            would be far in excess of any possible cost to the Japanese economy of
                            substantial liberalization measures. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> acknowledged the point and commented that the same
                            principle applies in the United States Government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> laughingly agreed and said that
                            that was certainly so, and, in fact, it sometimes happens that way.</p>

                            about the Administrative Agreement and made the <pb n="230"
                                xml:id="pg_230" facs="0260"/>point that, from the Japanese point of
                            view, the Administrative Agreement must be parallel in its terms to that
                            between the United States and Germany. In this connection, there has
                            been some difficulty with regard to the furnishing of facilities by
                            Japan to the U.S. Armed Forces. Specifically, the method of computing
                            claims and how much cost the Government of Japan is actually bearing is
                            a problem which remains unsolved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said that he thought that the U.S. efforts to
                            solve the still unagreed items in accordance with the German formula had
                            been successful. The Ambassador pointed out that when Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> had visited Japan,
                            further attention had been given to the problem and that our
                            understanding had been that the suggestions put forward at that time had
                            been successful in meeting the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that he had discussed with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> the basic idea to make the
                            customs arrangements strictly parallel with those prevailing in Germany.
                            However, it appears that some problems remain to be solved. The
                            Minister, therefore, suggested that he hoped it would be possible to
                            work these out by means of setting up some special conversations to deal
                            with them. At this point the Ambassador pointed out that there seemed to
                            be some confusion about this. In his opinion, the matters raised by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> should not be injected
                            into the Ambassador’s discussion with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> on the Administrative
                            Agreement. The problems of claims to which the Minister had referred
                            involved interpretation under the Agreement, rather than basic policies
                            involved in the Agreement itself. These matters are under study at the
                            Joint Committee and this is the proper channel for their resolution. If
                            the Joint Committee is unable to reach a mutually satisfactory solution
                            of the problems, the proper step would be for the Foreign Office to
                            bring them to the attention of the Ambassador. The Ambassador indicated
                            that he is quite ready at any time to discuss these problems with the
                            Foreign Ministry. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            did not press the matter and agreed with the views expressed by the
                            Ambassador.</p>

                                                islanders are Japanese. If an armed attack occurs or

                                                under Article IV. In the event of an armed attack,
                                                it is the intention of the Government of Japan to

                            in Japan since knowledge that US stood ready to aid Japan in event of

                        <p>The phrase ’an armed attack’ in Article V of the treaty is taken out of
                            Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Obviously, purely
                            internal disorders or revolutions would not be considered armed attacks.
                            However, if a revolution were aided and abetted by an outside power such
                            assistance might possibly be considered an armed attack. It is
                            understood that, if so considered by the two governments, the United
                            States will be prepared to assist Japan to meet such indirect aggression
                            by taking such measures as may be practicable at the request of the

                            propose to me a provision for reviewing the treaty. He said that in
                            addition to necessity of being able to defend new treaty against
                            criticism that not even possibility of review existed [garble] years,
                            many Diet members were aware there was a review provision in Article 12
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Treaty. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was not of course suggesting that
                            the treaty draft which we have agreed can be changed, but he did feel a
                            provision, in the form of an agreed minute re treaty review, which could
                            be made public if necessary in Diet debates, was extremely important. In
                            particular it would enable him to deal with <persName corresp="#p_KI4"
                                >Kono</persName> or any other anti-mainstreamers who wanted to make
                            difficulties over the duration or other elements of the treaty.
                            Originally, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> had contemplated
                            that agreed minute should specifically mention reviewing the duration of
                            treaty itself but after reflection he felt that a more generalized
                            statement referring only to “aspects” of the treaty and incorporating
                            some language from Article 12 of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Treaty would be adequate and probably preferable from our viewpoint.
                            Following is text of proposed agreed minute:</p>

                            duration the period after which either party may give notice for
                            termination has been fixed at ten years. No explicit provision was made
                            for reviewing the treaty because in the agreed opinion of the two
                            governments stability is a very important factor in the security
                            relationship between the two countries. Obviously, if either party
                            should so request at any time while the treaty is in force, the two
                            parties would consult together for the purpose of reviewing any aspect
                            of the treaty or its related arrangements having regard for the factors
                            then affecting peace and security in the Far East.</p>

                            US-Korea) <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> would prefer not tie
                            minute on “indirect aggression” to those words in Article V. Japanese
                            proposal would also equate “indirect aggression” with “armed attack” as
                            used in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. It would therefore
                            raise serious complications. Furthermore, despite reference in Senate
                            Report, US Govt has never defined armed attack in terms of indirect
                            aggression in any formal agreement or minute with another government.
                            Believe Japanese point might be covered by Minute along following
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>Japanese Plenipotentiary:</p>
                        <p>“It seems obvious that any internal disorder or revolution aided and
                            abetted by an outside power might constitute a threat to the security
                                <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0269"/>of Japan. If such an
                            internal disorder or revolution is considered by the two Governments to
                            be of this character, it is understood that the United States would be
                            prepared upon the request of the Japanese Government to assist Japan to
                            meet this threat by taking such measures as may be deemed appropriate by
                            both Governments.”</p>
                        <p>Statement by United States Plenipotentiary would be as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Under the circumstances you have set forth, it is understood that the
                            United States would be prepared upon the request of the Japanese
                            Government to assist Japan to meet this threat by taking such measures
                            as may be deemed appropriate by both Governments.”</p>
                        <p>You may point out to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> that in no

                            treaty review, we had of course carefully considered the background and
                            all aspects of this problem including the points raised in your message.
                            You will recall that when I discussed treaty duration with Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> in September 1958 the original idea was
                            that the <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0270"/>treaty duration should
                            be the same as in our other security treaties in the Pacific. That is,
                            the treaty would remain in force indefinitely but any party might
                            withdraw at any time after one year’s notice. Subsequently when I
                            discussed this with members of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            and their representatives they strongly urged that we seek a minimum
                            ten-year duration so that they could have a long-term plan and also be
                            able to budget in an orderly manner for our important bases in Japan.
                            Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> concurred in this. However, in our
                            discussions of this matter it was understood that if the Japanese should
                            insist on the same duration provision as in all our other Pacific
                            treaties and make an issue of it we would have no course but to agree to
                            a one-year notification period. At no time was a 10-year duration
                            considered essential quid pro quo for US commitment. I was able actually
                            however to obtain an 11-year duration period in course our negotiations
                            here. Furthermore as I discussed duration with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>
                            leaders and explained to them the desirability from Japan’s viewpoint
                            for a longer period than provided in our other Pacific treaties they
                            came to agree that the 11-year period was appropriate.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of unpredictable developments our considered and best
                            judgment is that once the treaty is ratified there is no conservative
                            government in sight which would challenge the duration provision of the
                            treaty. Furthermore and in the absence of unpredictable developments it
                            seems doubtful that any conservative leader would be able to muster a
                            majority of the conservative party behind such a proposal for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>, Kaya, <persName
                                corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName>, Funada and others with whom I
                            have talked strongly favor the ten and one provision in the treaty. With
                            respect to <persName corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName> we must recognize
                            that whether or not there is a minute he is always capable of trying to
                            reopen the duration question if he saw prospect of making a quick
                            buck.</p>
                        <p>In our judgment points made reference telegram will not be persuasive to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. The point that our other
                            security treaties in the Far East have no comparable provision is not
                            relevant because those treaties may be denounced at any time on one
                            year’s notice. If we were willing to have a one-year duration period
                            with the Japanese there would be no purpose in a treaty review at the
                            request of either party. With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> treaty Article XII provides a review in the last ten
                            years of the treaty or at any time from 1959 on within next ten years.
                            Since new treaty is for ten years it is the view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that a minute re review is
                            appropriate in comparison with the provision in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> treaty. With respect to the comment
                            that a minute providing for review represents an open invitation for
                            reopening the treaty to every new Japanese Government in the event
                            differences arise between US and Japan, it goes without saying that if
                            serious major difficulties arise between us, or if kind of Japanese
                            Government which will compromise with Communists gains <pb n="241"
                                xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>office, our security relationship will
                            indeed be in jeopardy. This would be true whether or not there is a
                            minute providing for reviewing the treaty and its related arrangements,
                            and it is equally true under Article IV of treaty with the wrong kind of
                            Japanese Government. Panama is an example of what can happen despite
                            texts or provisions of treaties.</p>
                        <p>I disagree that we will encounter serious Congressional objection to a
                            minute providing for review of the treaty, for as the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee has been the first to recognize, any party to an
                            international treaty can ask for consultations for the purpose of
                            reviewing any of its pertinent aspects whenever it so desires. In its
                            June 6, 1949 report on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Article
                            12, Senate Committee Foreign Relations noted, as you will recall, that
                            even before ten years earlier review would be possible by unanimous
                            consent of signatories, and observed that interest of US would be amply
                            protected by requirement for Senatorial advice and consent on any
                            proposed amendments.</p>
                        <p>I would like to emphasize that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> is going to have a major battle on his hands to
                            get the treaty ratified and to rally support of all his factions and
                            public opinion. He may or may not be obliged to fight an election on
                            treaty issue. We can help him or make his task much more difficult. He
                            has taken over the handling of our talks from <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> and all proposals are now coming directly from
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. It is wholly in keeping
                            with era of partnership and equality and greatly in our own interest to
                            do what we can to make treaty ratification smoother because if the
                            treaty fails of ratification we cannot simply go back to the status-quo
                            ante for then our entire present security relationship with Japan will
                            be in great jeopardy. We can of course tell <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> we refuse to join in an agreed minute with him. In
                            such event I believe he would feel he must make some unilateral
                            statement in the Diet on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I again urge that we agree to a minute with <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>. If the minute which he proposed to us does not
                            seem satisfactory we could initially try out an alternative which would
                            be based on so-called Bohlen–Serrano formula of October 13.<note n="2"

                        <p>1402. From the Secretary for <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>. I have thoroughly considered Japanese
                            proposed minute on treaty review in light of strong case you have made
                            for its acceptance. I readily recognize desirability of giving <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> maximum assistance in securing
                            treaty ratification and according Japan fully equal treatment to our
                            other allies. I also am confident <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> would not personally use treaty review provision.
                            Nevertheless, it would in my judgment be a mistake to sign formal treaty
                            review agreement with Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>There is no exact precedent in our post-war security treaty system for
                            Japanese proposal. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Article 12 was
                            provision, coinciding with ten year review of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Charter, designed to take into account need for
                            flexibility and processes of peaceful change but only after treaty had
                            ten years to become stable and source of confidence. While Senate
                            recognized possibility of review prior to 10 years, review under these
                            circumstances by “unanimous consent” rather than request of a party.
                            Bohlen Serrano agreement also not precedent since it relates to 25 year
                            base agreement rather than treaty and Japan Administrative Agreement
                            already has comparable provision for review.</p>
                        <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0273"/>
                        <p>Lack of precedent however is not impossible barrier to overcome were it
                            not for political considerations arguing against Japanese proposal.
                            Basically, we fear treaty review provision would create impression both
                            here and in Japan that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> actually
                            wishes reopen treaty even though we are confident this is not <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s intention. It would confuse
                            public opinion which would feel some special meaning behind provision
                            and would invite continuing agitation from some elements now opposing
                            treaty. I am most anxious, on contrary, to create impression in US as
                            well as Japan of long-term durable ties between us. We had always
                            considered this was major underlying objective of both <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and ourselves in new treaty and
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was prepared to fight
                            for treaty on issue of whether Japan should align itself with US. At
                            best, treaty review provision will comfort those arguing for a less
                            permanent commitment to us. I fear that in future years its intent as
                            gesture to secure ratification could become increasingly clouded and
                            provision will encourage opportunist elements to undercut our treaty
                            ties whereas clear cut duration provision will discourage such future
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, if new treaty should become no longer viable–although I trust
                            this will not occur, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> not only has
                            inherent right to request treaty review but can resort to provisions for
                            consultation in Article IV as well as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            aspect of termination provisions in Article X.</p>
                        <p>I hope that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            could perhaps answer criticism of the treaty on this basis and recognize
                            advantages in avoiding a specific agreement on treaty review which would
                            confuse our public and could tempt mischievous elements in both
                            countries to undermine the firm long-term friendship we both desire.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your speaking personally to <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> of our objections to his proposal on treaty review
                            on such grounds as you consider will be most convincing to him. You
                            should affirm at same time our continued desire to strengthen his
                            prospects for securing ratification wherever prudently feasible.</p>

                            storm at upper house but his efforts were neither particularly effective
                            nor persuasive owing to: 1) his limited skill in Diet debate; 2) nature
                            of unresolved confidential discussions with US; and 3) fact that no Govt
                            can admit publicly that without even consultation, let alone agreement,
                            it will permit use of its territory for combat operations in which a

                                (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1864) he said in
                            strictest confidence that in view of my strong opposition to any formula
                            on “consultation” which contained the word “agreement” Japanese are
                            having extremely difficult time to come up with language for an agreed
                            minute. He said this problem is at the very heart of the revision of the
                            treaty for if public impression in Japan is created that we would
                            without Japanese consent introduce nuclear weapons into Japan or use our

                            obviously stem therefrom.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind some elements within <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> are now thinking that this is a problem which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> should discuss with the President.
                            (There have been a number of suggestions to this effect in press.) Their
                            view is that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would then be
                            in a position publicly to take line that he had discussed the
                            consultation matter with the President and latter had assured him that
                            US Govt had no intention of acting with respect to matters covered in
                            the consultation formula against the will of the Japanese Govt. I
                            gathered <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> believes the
                            President’s prestige is so great that this would enable <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to keep <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                                >Miki</persName> and other leaders of <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss> in line and at the same time such a procedure would not
                            involve an agreed minute or use of word “agreement” which he understood
                            from me would create serious difficulties for us in some of our security
                            arrangements with other countries. I told <persName corresp="#p_YH1"
                                >Yamada</persName> I would pass foregoing on to <gloss
                                target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> making clear it was not yet a formal
                            proposal, but had been told me informally and personally in strictest
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>There is no question whatsoever that consultation formula, as <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> says, is at very heart of treaty
                            revision problem for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>.
                            Furthermore, there is no way to prevent <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> from discussing it with the President if he wishes
                            to do so. However, if <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> puts
                            above proposal formally to us, it seems to me that if we can develop
                            some appropriate language for <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to use after his meeting with the President, we
                            might have acceptable solution to this very difficult problem. If we are
                            able to respond affirmatively it would seem preferable to proceed to
                            reach agreement on some appropriate language with the Japanese before
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> departs for Washington.
                            The alternative which to me seems less desirable would be to wait until
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> sees the President and
                            then try to work out agreed language.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> appreciates greatly our

                            to successful Diet ratification. He understands why it is not feasible
                            for us to use phrase “agreement” in consultation formula although this
                            would help him greatly with public, press and Conservative party
                            opinion. Also he will not press for an “agreed minute.” He feels that
                            language along lines of that in <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss> will meet his problem if it could be incorporated in

                            gather he feels that his position will be infinitely stronger if
                            proposals in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> are included in
                            communiqué. He does not believe it will be understood in Japan if
                            nothing is said about it in communiqué. He asked specifically that the
                            President and you be informed as to the great importance he attaches to
                            having language along lines of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>
                            in communique and how much it will help him in his efforts firmly to
                            consolidate Japanese opinion behind new treaty. I told <persName

                        <p>In view <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s request suggest

                            explained to <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> at length
                            why we would not wish to tie proposed agreed minute on indirect
                            aggression to language of Article V. I gave him language <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> making point that if Japanese
                            wished, minute could refer to Article IV or VI of new treaty. I said
                            however that we could not accept language referring to Article V, and if
                            this were indispensable in Japanese view, we would perhaps do better not
                            to make any public reference to matter, since even without minute we
                            would be prepared on request of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to
                            assist Japan to meet indirect aggression by such measures as both

                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> to consult with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and let me know latter’s

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> has just told me that he
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> have had long series
                            discussion this problem. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is
                            faced with dilemma. On one hand Kaya and certain other <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leaders who fear possibility of
                            Communist insurrection strongly want an agreed minute for its deterrent
                            effect on Communists. On other hand unless such agreed minute is tied to
                            Article V it might be construed in Diet discussions as simply
                            re-introducing Article I of present treaty re internal riots and
                            disturbances. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has publicly
                            announced such provisions would not be included in new treaty and his
                            announcement has been well received by press and public.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said with foregoing in
                            mind they had carefully considered our new draft and had unbalance
                            concluded that advantages favor some specific statement re indirect
                            aggression. They had concluded they could meet their requirements
                            without reference to Article V, but they would like a somewhat shorter
                            version than we had proposed. They had not completely decided however
                            whether form of such statement should be as agreed minute, or as
                            paragraph in possible joint official communiqué to be issued after
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s meeting with the

                                    to assist Japan to meet this indirect aggression by taking such

                        <p>The treaty negotiations have made considerable progress over the past few
                            weeks but there remain a few issues to resolve. As a result of your
                            conversations with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                                >Gates</persName>, both the Korea problem and the agreed minute on
                            the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands have been resolved. The Japanese agreed to
                            the deletion of two of the three crucial words objected to by the
                            Defense Department in the Security Consultative Committee action on
                            Korea, including the one point you and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> insisted upon having deleted.
                            They also accepted our language on the Ryukyu minute. In addition,
                            almost all the Administrative Agreement problems have been worked
                            out.</p>

                                    <p>The Japanese have long considered crucial a public indication
                                        that under the new consultation agreement, we will not
                                        ignore the views of the Japanese Government. While we have
                                        resisted any specific public reference to the need for
                                        Japanese “agreement”, we had agreed to a proposal that Prime
                                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> state
                                        after his meeting with the President that: “Prime Minister
                                            <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> stated that
                                        he had discussed the problem of consultation with the
                                        President under the new treaty arrangements. The President
                                        had assured him that the U.S. Government had no intention of
                                        acting with respect to the matters involving consultation in
                                        a manner contrary to the wishes of the Japanese Government.”
                                        This language has been accepted by the Japanese. Prime
                                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                                        considers it essential to Diet ratification that this
                                        language be included in the communique to be issued after
                                        his meeting with the President. The questions of U.S.
                                        introduction of nuclear weapons and use of Japanese bases in
                                        the event of hostilities elsewhere in the Far East have been
                                        the subject of prolonged Diet debate for some years. From a
                                        political viewpoint, we would agree that it is most
                                        important for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to
                                        have included in the communiqué, rather than as a unilateral
                                        statement by him, the President’s assurances that our
                                        agreement to consult on these matters is not a pro-forma
                                        exercise. (The reference messages are attached.)<note n="1"

                                    <p>The Japanese have proposed an agreed minute indicating that
                                        we would consult together for the purpose of considering
                                        appropriate assistance to Japan in the event of “indirect
                                        aggression” against Japan. We have agreed to this proposal
                                        but our proposed language has not yet been accepted by

                                    <p>The Japanese have proposed that they be given the right to
                                        inspect PX goods and other imports brought in by our forces
                                        for the personal, rather than official, use of our forces.
                                        We have agreed to a public note granting Japan this right on
                                        the condition that they agree privately to exercise the
                                        right only in exceptional cases of suspicion. Our
                                        counterproposal disappointed the Japanese who hoped to
                                        receive exactly the same treatment given the Germans on
                                        customs examination but they are examining it.</p></item>

                                    <p>After indicating that it appeared impossible to resolve
                                        several outstanding labor difficulties in the current
                                        negotiations, the Japanese have made a last minute proposal
                                        for certain revisions in the Administrative Agreement which
                                        would solve the two labor questions still outstanding–the
                                        handling of security discharges and the status of Japanese
                                        employees of our non-appropriated fund activities. Their
                                        proposals follow generally along the lines of our proposed
                                        handling of these matters several months ago. However, there
                                        is strong opposition to the Japanese proposals from <gloss

                                        questions. While the Japanese proposal is belated, it is
                                        generally a reasonable proposal and one that will permit us
                                        to avoid serious labor difficulties in subsequent
                                            years.<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">See <ref

                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister briefly discussed the progress that
                            had been made in U.S.-Japanese relations since the Prime Minister’s
                            visit in 1957. The President expressed pleasure that many of the
                            problems discussed during the 1957 visit had been solved or at least
                            progress made towards their solution. The Prime Minister agreed and <pb
                                n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0290"/>expressed pleasure at the
                            increasingly close cooperation between the two countries and the
                            energetic efforts to settle differences to the mutual benefit of both
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister also discussed Japanese-American
                            trade relations. The Prime Minister noted the rapid increase in trade
                            between the two countries and said that his administration was
                            developing a program to relax dollar restrictions in order to have a
                            more healthy economic development. The President expressed appreciation
                            for the Prime Minister’s understanding of the difficulties in the United
                            States on such trade problems as textiles and stainless steel
                                flatware.<note n="1" xml:id="d132fn1">See <ref target="#d94fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 94</ref>.</note> He said that Japanese
                            control of exports to the U.S. in these areas was very helpful in
                            reducing demands for high protective tariffs. He hoped that future
                            problems, which might be unavoidable, could be worked out in the same
                            spirit of cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The President raised the question of the settlement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> claims and indicated that any
                            settlement between the United States proposal of $643 million and the
                            Japanese proposal of $550 million would be acceptable to him. He urged
                            an early settlement so that the issue could not be exploited by
                            politicians in either country to the detriment of U.S.-Japanese
                            relations. The Prime Minister said he would discuss <gloss
                                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President finally assured the Prime Minister that the United States
                            intends to consult with Japan under the new treaty fully, completely,
                            and as equals. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not

                        <p>The Prime Minister briefly reviewed the domestic political situation in
                            Japan. He said that his party had the full support from the <pb n="261"
                                xml:id="pg_261" facs="0291"/>Japanese public during the recent
                            elections. However, leftists and Communist subversive elements in Japan
                            and the Sino-Soviet bloc are attempting to neutralize Japan and separate
                            it from the United States. The President inquired as to the strength of
                            the left-wing opposition. The Prime Minister replied that his Liberal
                            Democratic Party holds almost two-thirds of the Diet seats and the
                            opposition is not a dominant or even great element. He noted that the
                            Sino-Soviet propaganda is currently based on two themes, the dominant
                            theme pointing to the “thaw” in East-West relations particularly since
                            Khrushchev’s visit to Washington and claiming that the new treaty puts
                            Japan in opposition to this trend. The Prime Minister felt that the
                            Japanese people approve this new treaty despite the left-wing
                            opposition. The President noted the importance of the treaty. He also
                            mentioned that the so-called “spirit of Camp David” was a term devised
                            by Communist propagandists for their own purposes.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that the
                            Japanese fully appreciated the President’s effort to create an
                            atmosphere conducive to the relaxation of world tensions. He expressed
                            an interest in hearing the President’s estimate of the prospects for the
                            forthcoming Summit meeting. He pointed out that other problems in Asia,
                            for example Communist China, would remain even if the European problems
                            are settled. The President reviewed the main issues to be discussed at
                            the Summit meeting. He said that the Soviet Union is still stubborn on
                            German reunification. He said that Berlin is a very delicate issue since
                            it is a show window of freedom deep inside East Germany. Khrushchev
                            faces two alternatives in dealing with the Berlin question, eliminating
                            West Berlin or making East Germany and East Berlin equally prosperous
                            which is impractical. The President concluded that Berlin, therefore, is
                            the greatest possible danger spot.</p>
                        <p>The President then explained that all efforts to reach agreement on a
                            nuclear test ban had been thwarted by the Soviet Union which is
                            determined to prevent effective inspection of its country. He reviewed
                            for the Prime Minister the various western proposals for a nuclear test
                            agreement which have not been accepted by the Soviet Union. The
                            President also expressed doubts on the possibility for concluding an
                            over-all disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union although he
                            believes that the Soviet Union, due to the high cost of armaments, does
                            want an agreement if it can be reached without harming its own
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned several areas where there had been improvement in
                            relations with the Soviet Union, the exchange of visits between American
                            and Soviet groups and abandonment of jamming of the Voice of America. He
                            recounted for the Prime Minister various instances demonstrating that
                            the Soviet leaders, however, do not understand freedom as it is known in
                            the west. The President concluded that Khrushchev’s recent deportment
                            provides grounds for being a little bit <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263"
                                facs="0293"/>more hopeful but the President was cautious regarding
                            the prospect for any real progress at the first Summit meeting, although
                            he felt that this meeting in itself should improve the atmosphere. In
                            this connection, the President noted that Khrushchev must consider his
                            own allies such as Communist China and indicated that Khrushchev might
                            fear a strong Red China would challenge the U.S.S.R.</p>

                        <p>The President and Prime Minister discussed Communist China and other
                            Asian problems. The President reaffirmed that there would be no change
                            in United States policy toward Communist China as long as the Communist
                            Chinese continued their present conduct. Furthermore, Communist China’s
                            entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would lead to such a
                            strong public reaction in the United States that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might well be forced to leave the United
                            States. The President said that, if the Chinese Communists changed their
                            ways and took such actions as renouncing the use of force, releasing
                            American prisoners and living up to their promises, then we would face a
                            different problem. However, they have not indicated any intention of
                            taking such actions at the present time and there is no need to consider
                            a change in United States policy. The President also indicated that he
                            realized Japan faced an even more difficult problem in Red China due to
                            its geographical proximity to China. He assured the Prime Minister of
                            his willingness to consult with Japan at any time on the question of
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for the President’s assurances
                            and declared that his administration and party have no intention <pb
                                n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0294"/>of changing their policy on
                            non-recognition of Communist China. He thought, however, that it was
                            necessary to recognize that the Communists do exercise effective control
                            over China, that we should not expect the collapse of Communist China
                            and that Communist China is industrializing and making progress. The
                            Prime Minister said that Japan also assumes the Sino-Soviet alliance
                            will hold together despite reported differences between these two
                            Communist powers.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister felt that these facts must be faced, particularly by
                            Japan, because of its proximity and historical affinity to China. The
                            Prime Minister also mentioned the neutralist pressures on his government
                            for recognition. Nevertheless, he emphasized, the cornerstone of his
                            policy is the relationship with the U.S. and this is why the government
                            had entered into the new treaty. He concluded that, while Japan would
                            not recognize Communist China, there might be contact with Communist
                            China in non-political technical fields as well as a possible resumption
                            of trade. The Prime Minister expressed a desire for the closest
                            consultation with the United States on all Asian problems, such as
                            Communist China and Korea, as well as on security matters.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed with the need for such close consultation. He
                            referred, in this connection, to our efforts to keep the differences
                            between Japan and the Republic of Korea from becoming unmanageable. He
                            also expressed concern with the repercussions from a failure to consult
                            closely, as was the case with the Japanese decision to repatriate
                            Koreans in Japan to north Korea.<note n="1" xml:id="d136fn1">Under the
                                terms of the Calcutta Agreement, signed on August 13, 1959, between
                                the Red Cross Societies of Japan and the Democratic People’s
                                Republic of Korea, Korean residents in Japan who desired to go to
                                North Korea were enabled to do so. Applicants were screened by the
                                International Committee of the Red Cross. The first group of
                                repatriates departed from Japan on December 14, 1959. The Republic
                                of Korea objected to the agreement as well as to the repatriation
                                activities. Documentation on this subject is in Department of
                                States, Central File 294.9522. See also <ref target="#d142">Document

                        <p>In the discussion of Asian problems, the Prime Minister referred to the
                            difficulties faced by Indonesia due to its political instability and
                            Sino-Soviet activities in that country. He mentioned Japanese reparation
                            payments and other economic efforts to help develop Indonesia and hoped
                            the United States and Japan would cooperate to prevent this country
                            falling under the Communists. The President indicated the United States
                            wished to consult on this area too, since we share the Japanese
                            view.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, the President described his trip in December to
                            South Asia and other countries.<note n="1" xml:id="d137fn1">From
                                December 4 to 22, 1959, the President visited Italy, Turkey,
                                Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Greece, Tunisia, France, Spain,
                                and Morocco. December 19–21, he was in Paris attending the meeting
                                of heads of state and government with Prime Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> of Great Britain,
                                President de Gaulle of France, and Chancellor <persName
                                    corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> of Germany, during which
                                the upcoming summit meeting of May 15–19, 1960, was
                                discussed.</note> He explained that the purpose of his trip was not
                            to negotiate any agreement or treaty but to seek an improvement in the
                            international atmosphere and convey to the peoples of the countries
                            visited the deep desire of the United States for peace and our readiness
                            to work and sacrifice for this objective. He hoped that the improved
                            economic condition of the industrialized nations would permit them to
                            work for improved conditions and a better living standard in those
                            nations where it was obviously low.</p>
                        <p>The President said that nothing of great importance took place in Italy
                            but he noted Italy’s strong desire to participate in the top
                            international councils. He found the new Pope<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d137fn2"><persName>John</persName> XXIII, Pope from October
                                1958 to June 1963.</note> to be a very engaging personality.
                            Regarding Turkey, the President particularly mentioned the great
                            improvement in conditions there since his previous visit in 1952, the
                            intense hatred of communism among the Turks and their desire for U.S.
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he found the Pakistan leader, President Ayub
                            Khan, an enlightened and intelligent person who is leading Pakistan
                            toward freedom gradually, although democracy as it is known in the
                            United States does not yet exist there. He also mentioned Ayub’s desire
                            to strengthen ties with India in order to face up to the Communist
                            threat from the north rather than to continue their dispute over
                            Kashmir. The President commented to the Prime Minister that Afghanistan
                            is unbelievably poor and has received a tremendous amount of Soviet aid
                                <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0296"/>which, if continued at
                            present levels, could result in this country becoming an economic
                            dependent of the Soviet Union if not, indeed, a political dependent.</p>
                        <p>The President said that India faces great problems, the most important of
                            which is to educate its 40,000,000 people in the techniques necessary to
                            permit industrialization and improved agriculture. Prime Minister Nehru
                            is not pessimistic regarding India’s prospects but needs help, not only
                            investment capital but technical assistance. In this connection, the
                            President said that Prime Minister Nehru is most interested in Japanese
                            industrial techniques with their relatively great utilization of
                            manpower. The President discussed Mr. Nehru’s concern, shared by
                            Pakistan, regarding recent Chinese Communist incursions into Tibet and
                            Indian border areas, whose objective Nehru feels is seeking to recover
                            Chinese Communist prestige rather than threaten India directly. The
                            President thought this was wishful thinking. The President thought that
                            Iran was making progress, although there remains a great disparity
                            between the wealthy few and the low standard of living of most Iranians.
                            Discussing his visit to Tunisia, the President described President
                            Bourguiba as the most dynamic and vocal Moslem leader and an excellent
                            friend of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The President also touched briefly on his visits to Greece, Spain and
                            Morocco. Finally, he told the Prime Minister that, during his visit to
                            France arrangements were made for the Summit meeting.</p>
                        <p>In summing up his trip, the President said the strongest impression he
                            received was the great need in all the countries visited, except Italy,
                            for investment capital and technical aid. The poverty of the countries
                            visited stood out in bold relief, impressing him completely with the
                            need for assistance. The President felt that all the industrialized
                            nations must find a way to assist these countries and particularly a
                            means to prevent duplication of aid which would be completely wasteful.
                            He also mentioned that he was most encouraged by the fact that the
                            peoples of the countries he visited, despite exposure to intensive
                            Soviet propaganda, strongly desire freedom and do not wish to become
                            slaves in a state where their every activity would be directed.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister thanked the President for the description of his trip
                            which the Prime Minister felt had definitely contributed to an
                            improvement in the international atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>Following the President’s discussion of his December trip, the Prime
                            Minister discussed the need for aid to under-developed areas. The Prime
                            Minister agreed with the President that such aid was most important and
                            significant and expressed the hope that Japan could cooperate with the
                            United States in providing such aid as would promote peace and the
                            welfare of the peoples of the Free World. The President agreed that the
                            two countries should maintain periodic and constant consultation
                            regarding aid to areas where they have special and common interests.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed the particular need for assistance to
                            Africa. He mentioned the concern of President de Gaulle regarding the
                            proliferation of many new independent states in Africa which were not
                            ready for independence. The President said that, if the Communists
                            succeed in attracting these countries and other under-developed
                            countries either by propaganda based on glittering promises or with a
                            possibility of progress under a controlled economy, he feared that we
                            might find ourselves faced with a hostile bloc of sixty nations in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. However, the spirit of
                            nationalism cannot be stopped and this trend magnifies the importance of
                            the problem facing Japan and the U.S. A common understanding and
                            determination on the part of all nations, not just one or two, is,
                            therefore, necessary. The President mentioned that he had discussed this
                            problem with the top Western European leaders who, while professing to
                            recognize the need for assistance, may not all be prepared to move ahead
                            as progressively as necessary. He said that he was certain that the
                            Prime Minister viewed this problem as seriously as did the United
                            States. He noted, however, that the United States must spread its aid
                            throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister mentioned his conversations on the need for assistance
                            to under-developed areas with European leaders on his visit to Europe
                            last summer. He said that, at that time he had emphasized the <pb
                                n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>need for haste, otherwise the
                            Communists would be given every opportunity to move in and exploit the
                            situation. He was, therefore, completely in agreement with the views of
                            the President and desired to cooperate with the United States in the
                            provision of assistance to underdeveloped nations. The President noted
                            that the United States is not only ready to consult on all matters of
                            economic cooperation but is prepared to make any arrangements to
                            expedite exchanges of people and experts between Japan and the United
                                States.<note n="1" xml:id="d138fn1">For text of the joint communiqué

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> opened the
                            discussion of U.S.-Japan trade problems. He said that last year there
                            had been a rapid improvement in <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0299"
                            />Japan’s balance of payments with the United States. Japan was doing
                            everything possible to assure orderly marketing and to exercise
                            self-restraint and control in its exports to the United States, although
                            it recognized that in some respects its efforts might not be sufficient.
                            He hoped that the United States would appreciate the efforts made by
                            Japan to contribute to a healthy growth of bilateral trade with the U.S.
                            The Prime Minister said that Japan was also making every effort on trade
                            liberalization at the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting in
                            Washington and later at the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            meeting in Tokyo. The Prime Minister then referred to the positive
                            measures in January to remove discriminatory measures against imports
                            from dollar sources. He stressed that Japan would continue to make as
                            much haste as possible to remove such discriminatory measures. The Prime
                            Minister said that, together with trade liberalization, the Government
                            also intends to liberalize foreign exchange controls to permit more
                            foreign capital, particularly from the United States, to enter Japan as
                            equity investments and thereby to contribute to stronger economic ties
                            with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that both
                            countries viewed with the utmost seriousness the problem of trade
                            between them. He wished to point out that several developments have made
                            the position of the Executive Branch on trade problems more difficult.
                            He mentioned that, first, there had been a meeting of the Governors of
                            the Southern States recently which had supported trade restrictions–a
                            reversal of the traditional Southern policy supporting free trade.
                            Secondly, there had been a sudden shift in the attitude of trade unions
                            indicating support for trade restrictionism where required to protect
                            American labor. The Secretary said that the Executive Branch intends to
                            fight for a continuation of a liberal trade policy. The Japanese could
                            be of most assistance in this fight by their efforts to continue orderly
                            marketing practices so that a given segment of American industry is not
                            wiped out. He pointed out that diversification of Japanese imports is
                            desirable so that the impact on one industry is not too great and there
                            is not a consequent increase in restrictionist pressures. The Secretary
                            said that the cooperation of the Japanese in this respect would be most
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied that
                            the Japanese Government recognized the difficulties in the United States
                            and appreciated the sympathetic understanding of the United States
                            Government with regard to trade problems. He mentioned that, as a result
                            of Japanese recognition of the problems faced by the United States,
                            Japan is prepared to make certain sacrifices with respect to Japanese
                            industries. He hoped, however, that the United States would also
                            understand Japan has its own internal problems but that it desires not
                            to permit the trade situation to get out of hand and hurt relations
                            between the United States and Japan. <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270"
                                facs="0300"/>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> replied that the U.S. fully appreciated the
                            problems faced by Japan and its efforts in the trade field.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            referred to the importance attached by Japan to close consultation with
                            the United States on economic matters not only on the diplomatic level
                            but also through private channels. He said that it is important that the
                            common economic problems of the United States and Japan be understood at
                            the private level in order to avoid difficulties. He thought that it
                            would be in the spirit of the Communiqué to be issued today<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d139fn1">See <ref target="#d138fn1">footnote 1, Document

                            business contacts between the United States and Japan. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> commented that, since
                            the United States has its domestic problems, he agreed that it would be
                            helpful if trade issues could be isolated at an early stage rather than
                            waiting until the problems develop to the point where legislative action
                            is demanded. However, the stimulation of private activity is not always
                            easy. He mentioned that there are organizations such as the Chamber of
                            Commerce that provide channels for exchanges and the fruitful
                            development of new ideas. In addition, the America-Japan Centennial this
                            year and the forthcoming exchange of official visits should stimulate
                            other private exchanges. He pointed out that the private exchanges
                            proposed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            were consistent with the United States view that the primary role in
                            trade should be played by private groups and that the Government should
                            intervene only when private efforts fail.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> mentioned
                            that Mr. Adachi <note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Tadashi Adachi, Chairman of
                                Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</note> plans to discuss with
                            private American businessmen the establishment of a non-governmental
                            U.S.-Japan committee. He pointed out that such a committee could be
                            productive only if it were clear that they would not discuss price
                            fixing and if the committee would deal with both Japanese trade problems
                            in the United States and American trade problems in Japan. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> mentioned that
                            American antitrust laws are difficult and give the Attorney General very
                            little discretion, so that we cannot become involved in any committee
                            appearing to regulate prices. However, he thought that, if a private
                            U.S.-Japanese committee were to consider trade problems in both
                            countries, real progress seemed possible in resolving these trade
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said now that
                            the reparation agreements with Southeast Asia had been completed and the
                            Japanese Government can foresee its requirements for these programs, it
                            intends to move ahead rapidly with a <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1"
                                >GARIOA</gloss> settlement. He proposed that on his return to <pb

                            commence between the Foreign Ministry and the American Embassy there.
                            After treaty ratification is completed, he proposed that there be formal
                            talks based on the working level talks. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that this arrangement was
                            agreeable since we did not wish to injure treaty ratification by the
                            negotiations for a <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement.
                            He reiterated the President’s remarks on the need for a <gloss
                                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement within the figures set
                            forth by the President and expressed the hope that an agreement could be

                            difficult. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                            commented that the working level talks would, of course, be completely

                                <p>The Prime Minister said that Japan’s initial defense plan ends
                                    this year. A second defense plan is now being developed and this
                                    new plan will be based upon the new treaty. He said that in the
                                    course of the defense buildup by Japan, the Japanese Government
                                    hopes that the U.S. will continue to assist Japan in every way
                                    possible. He said that the Japanese understand that there are
                                    differing American views on the continuation of military
                                    assistance to Japan and that it is also important for Japan to
                                    take the initiative in setting forth its defense plans. At the
                                    same time, while Japan must do its part, it is hoped that the
                                    U.S. will continue to assist the defense buildup.</p>

                                    said that the U.S. hopes to play a part in the Japanese defense
                                    buildup by continuing some form of military assistance. He
                                    stressed that the U.S. has two main problems in this respect.
                                    First, Congress has reduced the appropriations for military
                                    assistance and, second, there is the problem of Congressional
                                    attitudes toward assistance to countries who have improved their
                                    economic position in recent years, such as Japan. Nevertheless,
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said, the
                                    U.S. hopes to continue its assistance at approximately the 1960
                                    level but as part of a cost-sharing program in which both
                                    countries play cooperating roles.</p></item>

                                        on in Tokyo. Documents relating to the subject are in

                                    is limited and that the U.S. will not be able to go above $75
                                    million as its share of the cost of the program. The U.S.
                                    realizes that the costs of the program have increased but
                                    pressures in the U.S., particularly as a result of the reduction
                                    in Congressional appropriations, make it impossible to increase
                                    the U.S. share. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"

                                    would be in “kind” as well as through direct financial grants.
                                    Assistance in “kind”, such as was done in the P2V production

                                    would be very helpful to Japan particularly at this time when
                                    the budget has already been formulated. The Prime Minister
                                    pointed out that he only wished to mention this problem briefly
                                    since he recognized that there was a U.S. mission in Japan now
                                    negotiating on the F–104 program and the problem is being
                                    handled through diplomatic channels. The Prime Minister said
                                    that he did, however, wish to note the desires of the Japanese
                                    Government on this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1"
                                        >Irwin</persName> replied that he personally had just
                                    learned of the technical difficulties facing the Japanese
                                    Government as a result of the different handling of the P2V
                                    program and the F–104 program. He said that he was not sure why
                                    the Air Force is not providing assistance in kind to the F–104
                                    program. However, the U.S. understands the difficulties faced by
                                    the Japanese Government in having the Japanese Government budget
                                    for the whole <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0303"/>program
                                    and then having the U.S. reimburse the Japanese Government for
                                    the U.S. share. Mr. Irwin said that the U.S. would try to work
                                    out some form of mutually accommodating arrangement on this
                                    matter.</p></item>

                                <p>Assistant Secretary <persName>Parsons</persName> commented on the
                                    problem of the pending claims under the Administrative
                                    Agreement. He said that since this was a highly complicated
                                    question, he did not wish to get involved in the details. The
                                    problems involved go back some years and relate to claims
                                    arising under the old Administrative Agreement which in their
                                    total amount are a fairly sizeable sum. He mentioned that there
                                    are three main issues involved: 1) the status of the Japanese
                                    National Railway, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public
                                    Corporation and the Japan Monopoly Corporation as governmental
                                    or non-governmental entities; 2) movable property claims; and 3)
                                    the rates charged the U.S. for use of leased long-distance
                                    telephone facilities. The U.S. has proposed a package deal which
                                    has balancing provisions. Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName>
                                    stressed that the key element to the U.S. in this package deal
                                    is the question of the rates charged us for use of leased long
                                    distance telephone lines. Over the years, we have paid rates
                                    which are quite high, in fact higher than those paid in other
                                    countries, while the telephone corporation has made considerable
                                    profits. At the same time, Japanese police agencies have paid
                                    very much lower rates. Mr. Parsons said that as part of the U.S.
                                    package it is proposed that the U.S. armed forces pay rates
                                    equal to those paid by the Japanese police. He said that he
                                    considered this a reasonable and equitable settlement
                                    particularly since the U.S. forces were in Japan for the purpose
                                    of providing Japanese security. Mr. Parsons pointed out that the
                                    major importance of this issue is that, if it became public
                                    during the Diet debate on the new treaty, opponents could
                                    exploit the issue of pointing to U.S. and Japanese failure to
                                    agree on this matter. He mentioned that it is also the type of
                                    issue which opponents in the U.S. could exploit by pointing out
                                    that, while Japan receives military assistance from us, it still
                                    charges us high telephone rates. He concluded that the U.S.
                                    hopes that the whole package proposed by Ambassador <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> will commend itself
                                    to the Japanese Government after study. He stressed that the
                                    package had been worked out with great care here in
                                    Washington.</p></item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> commented that he was not
                            familiar with the problem of pending claims under the Administrative
                            Agreement. In his view, however, it was important to settle this issue
                            as soon as possible. He said that, when he returned to Japan, he
                            intended to study the question and urge a reasonable and early
                            settlement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            expressed gratification since this was an issue that could make trouble
                            for both Governments.</p>

                                    briefly mentioned the Ryukyu problem. He said that on the

                                    President the need for promoting the general welfare of

                                    States had taken steps to promote the welfare of the Ryukyuans
                                    and Japan was grateful for these measures. The Prime Minister
                                    commented that he feels that recent Japanese efforts to promote
                                    economic welfare in the Ryukyus have also been helpful. However,
                                    there remain areas where the welfare of the Ryukyuans can be
                                    furthered by United States-Japanese cooperation, such as the

                                    arrangements with the United States. He said that the Japanese
                                    Government would continue to explore through diplomatic channels
                                    the other areas where United States-Japanese cooperation in

                                    asked whether there would be any objection if he told the press
                                    merely that there was discussion with the Secretary of the

                                    the former residents of the Bonin Islands. He said that, during
                                    the White House luncheon, he had asked the Chairman of the House
                                    Foreign Affairs Committee whether his committee would act soon
                                    on the proposed legislation. The Chairman said that the
                                    Committee would take up the matter on the afternoon <pb n="275"

                                        <persName>Parsons</persName> expressed hope that the
                                    Committee would act favorably. He pointed out that Committee
                                    action at such an early stage in the Congressional session was
                                    most unusual but it reflects the interest of the Committee in
                                    the Bonin’s compensation problem as a result of the State
                                    Department’s initiative. He wished the Prime Minister to know
                                    that the United States had not forgotten the Bonin Islands

                            for the understanding and efforts on the part of the U.S. in the course
                            of its very difficult talks with the Republic of Korea. He also
                            expressed appreciation for the U.S. attitude toward the repatriation of
                            Koreans to north Korea. He said that the Japanese Government recognized
                            that the present state of relations between Japan and the Republic of
                            Korea is unfortunate not only for both countries but for the free world
                            as a whole. As a result, the Japanese Government is continuing its
                            negotiations with the Republic of Korea despite the difficulties
                            involved. The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the U.S. would
                            continue to help and cooperate in steering the talks between Japan and
                            the Republic of Korea to constructive channels. Secretary <persName

                            forth a request of the Korean Government that we ask the Prime Minister
                            to stop further repatriation to north Korea. The U.S., however, intends
                            to maintain its past position on the repatriation issue. The Secretary
                            stressed that the U.S. continues to support the principle of voluntary
                            repatriation to any part of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> mentioned
                            that in past sessions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General
                            Assembly the U.S. has advocated admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> of the Republic of Korea and of Viet Nam. He inquired
                            regarding the reasons for not requesting the admission of these
                            countries at the 1959 session of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            General Assembly. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> replied that our reasons were in the main
                            pragmatic. He said that we considered that there was no prospect for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> admitting those countries last
                            year and that another rebuff would hurt the prestige of both countries.
                            Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> added that we had taken care in the
                            speeches made by U.S. representatives at the Assembly to point out that
                            the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam are both qualified for membership.
                            However, at the 1959 Assembly, we did not have a situation parallel to
                            the one faced at previous sessions where opportunities were afforded to
                            seek the admission of both countries. He said that the U.S. had decided
                            that fruitless debate on this issue would do more harm than good and
                            therefore we would wait until an appropriate occasion arose. The
                            Secretary said that the application of the Cameroons for early admission
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might afford such an occasion
                            to raise the question of the admission of the Republic of Korea and Viet
                            Nam to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and we were now studying
                            this possibility. In any event, there would be other, and perhaps more
                            appropriate, occasions this year in connection with prospective
                            membership applications.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> raised the
                            question of relations with Communist China. He mentioned that, at the
                            meeting with the President, there had been quite a bit of discussion of
                            this question but that he wished to add briefly to his remarks at that
                            meeting. He said that the Japanese Government faces difficulties on the
                            Communist China issue not only from the Socialists and other
                            left-wingers but even from such Conservatives as Messrs. Ishibashi and
                            Matsumura. These two Conservative leaders were invited to Communist
                            China and their visits exploited by the Chinese Communists. However,
                            despite Communist China’s exploitation of these visits, the very fact
                            that Conservatives went to Peiping can be utilized to the general
                            benefit of the Conservative Party. The Prime Minister expressed the hope
                            that the U.S. would view the visits in that light and emphasized there
                            was no need for concern on the part of the U.S. regarding a change from
                            Japan’s policy towards Communist China as he had explained it to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> pointed out that Japan’s
                            relations with Communist China were completely ruptured through no fault
                            of the Japanese. Japan would like to resume trade with Communist China
                            under proper conditions. The Prime Minister said that in the past there
                            had been a tendency among some Japanese to overestimate the benefits to
                            be derived from such trade. However, this feeling was receding and not
                            much trade with Communist China is now expected by Japan. He pointed out
                            that, nevertheless, the pressure of historical ties and geographical
                            propinquity require some trade and other contacts under appropriate
                            circumstances. The Prime Minister said that, therefore, while the basic
                            policy of non-recognition will continue to guide Japanese relations with
                            Communist China, there may be some increased contacts in the future with
                            Peiping depending upon developments and particularly upon Communist
                            Chinese actions. He mentioned possible contacts in the fields of
                            communication, postal services, meteorology, radio, rescue on the high
                            seas and other technical areas. (Assistant Secretary

                                <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> that two points are
                            important with respect to any steps Japan may take at the technical
                            level with Communist China. First, in any action taken by Japan, the
                            Japanese should make it publicly clear that these are not steps toward
                            recognition. Secondly, the Japanese should–within the framework of
                            partnership and consultation with the U.S.–consult with the U.S. and
                            inform us of the actions they contemplate.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> inquired whether
                            there had been any trade talks with Communist China since the Communist
                            Chinese trade mission had created difficulties by insisting upon raising
                            a Communist Chinese flag in Japan, which would have been tantamount to
                                recognition.<note n="1" xml:id="d143fn1">The incident is described
                                in telegram 2728 from Tokyo, April 17, 1958. (Department of State,

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> informed the
                            Prime Minister that the U.S. would be very glad to receive a high level
                            Japanese Government official to discuss with him all matters relating to
                            Communist China on whatever basis is agreeable to the Japanese
                            Government. The Prime Minister said that he had been very pleased to
                            receive from the President the basic thinking of the U.S. on Communist
                            China and did not think a further exchange was now necessary. The
                            Secretary mentioned that the U.S. had had fruitful exchanges of views
                            with Britain and France on the impact of Communist China on Southeast
                            Asia. He said that, if such talks would be helpful to the Japanese
                            Government, we would be glad to sit down with a top Japanese Government
                            official.</p>

                            stimulated demands on the Japanese Government to safeguard Japan against

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> commented that
                            the Japanese Government feels trade with all countries should develop in

                            actions to prevent trade discrimination. He said that Japan does not
                            wish to see itself excluded from discussions of important international
                            problems involving discriminatory actions.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> described the
                            steps taken by the United States with respect to the problems posed by
                            European trading blocs. He mentioned that Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had been in Paris for the past
                            week as a result of discussions which had taken place on this matter
                            during the President’s trip to Europe. During his trip, the President
                            had discussed the problem of the “Sixes” and “Sevens” with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>, President de

                            discussed and, as a result, we had proposed in the Communiqué issued by
                            the Western leaders that a meeting take place in Paris on trade and
                            other economic problems.<note n="1" xml:id="d145fn1">The text of the

                            Secretary said that at the Paris meeting on January 12–14 they had
                            agreed to form several committees. One of the committees is to consider
                            a reorganized <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> in which Canada and
                            the United States could become full members, since we cannot join the
                            present <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> due to constitutional
                            problems. There is to be a special committee of four to prepare working
                            documents on the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> problem by April
                            19. He pointed out that the United States hoped to arrange for Japan to
                            associate itself with the successor organization to the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> although how such an association
                            would be arranged is not certain. In addition, it was agreed at the
                            Paris meeting that everything should be in the spirit of <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in an effort to insure
                            non-discriminatory trade. The Secretary emphasized that Japan and the
                            United States had a common interest in non-discrimination in trade and
                            that we wish to keep fully in touch with the Japanese Government on this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> mentioned that on January 15 a
                            departmental officer had met in Paris with Minister Sato of the Japanese
                            Embassy and briefed him fully on the developments at the Paris meeting.
                            The departmental officer had also mentioned that the United States hoped
                            for Japan to be associated not only with the successor organization to
                                <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> but with a capital exporting
                            group to be set up. Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName>
                            had been provided with copies of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName>’s statement, the original United States
                            resolutions as well as the final resolutions emerging from the meetings.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> commented that
                            the Japanese Embassy had received word of the discussions in Paris and
                            very much appreciated them.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> mentioned that
                            at the meeting with the President during the morning he had taken up the
                            question of assistance to under-developed areas. He said that during his
                            trip last year to Western <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0311"
                            />Europe, he had placed considerable importance on discussion of this
                            problem with the European leaders. He found both President de Gaulle and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName>
                            particularly interested in development projects in the African areas, in
                            view of the efforts by the Soviet Union to push its projects for
                            assistance to under-developed areas. The Prime Minister said that he
                            found himself in full agreement with the European leaders on this
                            question. Japan, at the same time, is particularly interested in
                            Southeast Asia, since it is close to Japan. He mentioned that Japan is
                            attempting to assist its neighbors in Southeast Asia through reparations
                            and other means such as private investment, the extension of long-term
                            credits, and tripartite arrangements with the U.S. such as the Orissa
                            iron ore project. The Prime Minister felt that, in this area, there is a
                            need for the closest liaison, contact and consultation between the
                            United States and Japan not only at the Government level but at the
                            private level. He hoped that both Governments would work to create an
                            atmosphere conducive to the stimulation of private contributions to the
                            development of under-developed areas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> inquired whether
                            the Prime Minister had discussed with other Government leaders the new
                            International Development Agency. The Prime Minister said that he had
                            and felt that with the establishment of the International Development
                            Agency there was no need for new organizations or agencies in the field
                            of development. He believed that what is necessary now is to enable the
                            existing agencies to work more effectively by recognizing the need for
                            assistance to underdeveloped areas and by earnest efforts on the part of
                            all countries. The Secretary agreed that there was no need for new
                            machinery but there was a need for closer consultation to coordinate
                            assistance efforts and establish priorities. He mentioned in this
                            connection that an informal group of capital exporters was set up at the
                            Paris meeting to consider this question and that the United States is
                            proposing to have Japan associated with this group.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> discussed the
                            forthcoming Law of the Sea Conference. He recalled that the last
                            Conference on Law of the Sea had broken up without agreement on the
                            question of territorial seas. He said that the United States Defense
                            Department, particularly the Navy, is seriously concerned by efforts to
                            establish a 12-mile limit to the territorial waters. This will create
                            serious difficulties for our Navy. He mentioned that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ADG2">Dean</persName> is now doing preparatory work for
                            the forthcoming Conference. The position that we hope to obtain support
                            for from two-thirds of the countries is for a six-mile limit with an
                            additional six-mile zone in which historic fishing rights would be
                            retained but phased out over a period equivalent to the average time
                            required to amortize a fishing vessel. American fishing interests which
                            are quite strong, would, of course, prefer a twelve-mile limit but they
                            recognize that the security problem is more important.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> expressed the
                            hope that the Japanese Government would give sympathetic consideration
                            to our position. He mentioned that Mr. Takahashi was being fully
                            informed of our position. He said that the United States realizes that
                            its position creates problems but hopes that its friends will support it
                            since it is impossible to obtain sufficient support for a three-mile
                            territorial sea which is most desirable.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> commented that
                            Japan has a very close interest and concern with the problem of the
                            territorial sea. It does not wish to see the territorial sea extended
                            from the standpoint of its security and fishing interests. He thought
                            that perhaps the Japanese position on this matter was even stronger than
                            that of the United States.</p>

                            that Soviet attacks were resented by overwhelming majority of Japanese
                            and even leftist Asahi criticized this Soviet intervention in Japan’s

                            Soviet miscalculation of Japanese sentiment stems from fact that Soviets
                            make their estimates of Japanese opinion on basis of advice they receive
                            from Japanese leftists who do not reflect Japanese opinion. In any

                            dissolution of Diet mentioned <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                            >reftel</gloss>s. We particularly concerned, however, by implications of
                            early dissolution on schedule for treaty ratification.</p>
                        <p>As you know we plan to seek formal Senate ratification of treaty
                            following Diet action although Foreign Relations Committee consideration
                            of treaty in Executive session would precede final Diet action. Given
                            pressure for early Congressional adjournment this year, it would be very
                            risky to schedule full Senate consideration of treaty much later than
                            beginning of June. Diet dissolution would however involve up to 40 day
                            break in Diet’s session and would appear to us make Diet ratification of
                            treaty by late May extremely doubtful. Thus there would be distinct risk
                            which we wish to avoid if at all possible of carrying over Senate
                            consideration of treaty to next session.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we are concerned by possibility of pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> developing in course election
                            campaign or as result his formation new government to revise certain

                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> night Feb 6 at his request to
                            discuss the domestic political situation, notably the possibility of
                            early Diet dissolution and new elections.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he wished the President
                            and the Secretary in strictest confidence to know of his views on this
                            important matter. In first place he is completely confident that the new
                            security treaty and related arrangements are approved by great majority
                            of Japanese people. Therefore, while he has no present intention of
                            dissolving the Diet, present domestic political situation is not
                            entirely stable and if Diet dissolution is necessary to get a mandate
                            from Japanese people, not only for ratification of security treaty but
                            for continuing in the coming years his firm policy of alignment with the
                            US and the free world, he would not hesitate to dissolve the Diet and
                            call for new elections.</p>
                        <p>As example of development which might lead to Diet dissolution, he said
                            Socialist Party would probably boycott the final Diet deliberations on
                            new treaty. Should Democratic Socialist Party also boycott Diet, he
                            believed mandate from Japanese people through new elections might be
                            desirable to make clear that the treaty is approved by substantial
                            majority of Japanese people and is not just being railroaded through
                            Diet in absence of opposition parties. This is particularly important
                            because of notorious anti-<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> attitude
                            of Japanese press. He added there might be other unpredictable internal
                            developments which would cause him to dissolve the Diet even earlier in
                            session. However, he would only resort to dissolution if he felt it
                            essential to get strong support for the new treaty and for the
                            continuation of his firm pro-Western policy.</p>
                        <p>He concluded by saying he felt chances were 60 to 40 against Diet
                            dissolution and in end even Socialists might decide they did not wish
                            force elections on the issue of new treaty and Japan’s free world
                            foreign policy which is approved by Japanese people. However, if he
                            should decide Diet dissolution was unavoidable he would “act like
                            lightning” and not give advance notice of Diet dissolution. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> concluded by saying again that
                            above information on possible Diet dissolution be conveyed to President
                            and Secretary but otherwise be held in strictest confidence.</p>

                            <item>Japan’s critical dependence upon the US for defense and on the
                                non-Communist world for trade will continue to be a powerful
                                deterrent to any significant shift in Japanese foreign policy.
                                Assuming ratification of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
                                and Security–which we believe to be likely–and no major economic
                                reverses, Japan’s foreign policy will probably remain essentially
                                unchanged over the next two or three years. (Paras. 12,
                                16–17)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Under the revised security treaty, the US will probably be able to
                                maintain a substantial military position in Japan. Despite continued
                                left-wing opposition to US forces and bases in Japan, and the
                                dependence of these bases upon Japanese labor for effective
                                operations, we believe that the US will be able to use them for
                                logistical support of security actions in the Far East. The Japanese
                                Government probably would not agree to the launching of combat
                                operations from the bases unless it were convinced that the
                                hostilities involved a critical threat to Japan’s security. (Paras.
                                37–38)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>It is highly unlikely that Japan will consent to the introduction
                                of nuclear weapons into Japan during the period of this estimate.
                                Except in an extreme emergency such as a direct threat of attack on
                                Japan itself or, possibly, as a last resort to keep South Korea from
                                falling before a Communist invasion, it is virtually certain that
                                Japan would not agree to permit the launching of nuclear strikes
                                from bases in Japan. (Para. 39)</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>A key factor in Japan’s international orientation is the state of
                                the economy. The economic outlook for Japan is good, assuming
                                continued high levels of foreign trade, particularly with the US. A
                                prolonged economic recession would probably create strong pressures
                                within Japan for expanded relations with the Bloc, particularly
                                Communist China. (Paras. 13, 28–30)</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Under any government an important Japanese foreign policy
                                objective will be the improvement and, eventually, the normalization
                                of relations with Communist China. Japan will probably make no
                                significant overtures in that direction so long as Communist China
                                continues its hostility toward the <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                    >Kishi</persName> government or insists upon the loosening of
                                US-Japanese ties and the acceptance of Peiping’s claim to Taiwan as
                                the price for improved relations. However, if Peiping were to reduce
                                its demands and adopt a conciliatory approach, Japan would probably
                                agree to Chinese Communist offers to expand trade and other
                                relations. If Communist China were admitted to the <gloss

                                recognize Peiping, Japan would probably feel a strong compulsion to
                                recognize Peiping, although it would probably seek US acquiescence.

                            <item>There is widespread, but at present quiescent, neutralist
                                sentiment in Japan. This sentiment could increase rapidly if the
                                Japanese came to believe that US deterrent power could not prevent
                                Communist aggression. Soviet rocket and space achievements have
                                already raised some doubts on this score where none existed two
                                years ago. (Para. 20)</item>

                            circumstances, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> must move
                            cautiously and deftly.</p>
                        <p>One of most critical problems ahead is projected revamping of cabinet and
                            party posts after treaty passes Diet. A cabinet and party leadership
                            incorporating all <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> factions would
                            demonstrate very high degree of control over party by Prime Minister.
                            Because such a solution would also strengthen <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> personally, it is doubtful that all of his <gloss

                            Result may well be that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> will
                            make only minor changes in composition of cabinet and party leadership
                            in belief that no alternative arrangement offers more practicable
                            combination under present balance of factional forces and ambitions.
                            Whatever he does, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> will be
                            criticized by his rivals and the press as too domineering, too weak, or
                            only interested in securing his own future. There are no signs yet that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is any less confident of

                                grossly distorted by the Japanese press. In concluding the
                                conversation, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he
                                remained confident that he could secure the passage of the treaty

                                794.2/3–1260)</note> I dined privately with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> last night. He expressed
                            confidence that Diet would ratify security treaty during regular session
                            and that extension of Diet would not be necessary. He believed all
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> factions with possible exception
                            of <persName corresp="#p_IT2">Ishibashi</persName> would support

                            inconsequential.</p>
                        <p>Referring to <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> factionalism he said
                            situation has vastly improved in past few weeks and it no longer
                            necessary to consider Diet dissolution. I commented I understood

                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> were giving <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> solid support. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> replied that support and help he is receiving from
                            Yoshida has been of inestimable value and is largely responsible for
                            improvement in factionalism within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>.
                            He said there are no problems between <persName corresp="#p_YS2"
                                >Yoshida</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SE3">Sato</persName> and himself. I asked
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SE3"
                                >Sato</persName> were supporting him for third term. He replied that
                            at present feeling among “responsible leaders” of <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> is that there is no one other than
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> who could muster a
                            majority for party presidency next autumn when presidency election takes
                            place. He said that while <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>
                            was a very good man it therefore seemed almost inevitable that he
                                (<persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>) would be obliged to
                            have a third term.</p>
                        <p>I asked when reshuffle of cabinet and top party posts would occur.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said it would be
                            inappropriate and create confusion to conduct reshuffle of cabinet and
                            top party posts between termination of Diet end of May and arrival of
                            President June 19. Therefore he would deal with problem of reshuffle
                            following President’s trip with reorganization of cabinet and top party
                            posts probably being consummated in July.</p>

                            anti-mainstream elements would join with mainstream in supporting
                            it.</p>
                        <p>To Ambassador’s question, Funada believes, but cannot be certain,
                            anti-mainstream will join mainstream in putting treaty to vote in lower
                            house late this month even if <gloss target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss> in end

                                >Kishi</persName> and <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leadership
                            is to put treaty through as smoothly as possible, with <gloss
                                target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss> present. This may take a few extra days
                            but as a result of <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leadership’s
                            concessions, prospect now is that in end all <gloss target="#t_LDP1"
                                >LDP</gloss> faction leaders except <persName corresp="#p_IT2"
                                >Ishibashi</persName> and Matsumura (and handful of their followers)
                            will vote for treaty.</p>
                        <p>Funada said he realized inability meet original schedule for Diet passage
                            of treaty would create complications in handling of treaty by US Senate.
                            He asked, however, if it might not be possible for Senate to conduct all
                            necessary hearings and debate in June after treaty passes lower house
                            and thus be prepared to take final vote immediately after final Diet
                            approval accomplished and before Senate goes out of session.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador informed Funada Senate would be extremely pressed in closing
                            days of session and would almost certainly close early in July. He could
                            not say whether Senate leadership would be willing conduct hearings on
                            treaty before upper house of Diet has acted but would, however, explore
                            matter with Washington. Ambassador will cable separately his view re
                            Senate action (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 2587).<note

                            afternoon began to collect outside Speaker’s door to prevent his

                        <p>Far too early to judge effect of treaty vote on intra-<gloss

                            but noteworthy that substantial number of their faction members stayed

                            upper house may choose to vote on treaty; if not, leaders see no
                            possibility of complications which will prevent upper house approval by

                        <p>Socialist views. Consternation and anger in both Socialist parties today,
                            with threats, especially from <gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>, to

                            Government plan is that should mass resignations unexpectedly come, it

                            questioned Socialist sincerity in opposing Diet extension while

                            further. It is still too soon to predict whether press and public outcry

                            this morning to discuss treaty passage by lower house including its
                            aftermath in terms domestic political situation.</p>
                        <p>Funada said <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> strategy calling in
                            police following Socialist resort to force and then voting in quick
                            succession to close debate in treaty committee, extend Diet, and ratify
                            treaty was really the only way to handle situation. To have wavered
                            would only have made the problem worse, particularly in making it
                            necessary to call police in to Diet again when treaty was voted. He
                            confirmed, however, that top <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>
                            leadership was not entirely confident it would have sufficient support
                            within <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0328"/>ranks to manage vote on
                            treaty when it did (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>).
                            Socialist resort to violence and, perhaps even more so, <gloss
                                target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss>’s boycott of vote on extension (in
                            contrast its professed support of parliamentarianism) caused many <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> Diet men to support quick vote who
                            might otherwise have favored delay. He said more than 250 <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> members (an absolute majority of lower
                            house) voted for treaty which was unusually impressive.</p>
                        <p>Funada said motivation for boycott of vote on treaty by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KI4">Kono</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MT3"
                                >Miki</persName> purely political, i.e. their long-standing
                            determination to weaken <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> by
                            all available means. He noted that Socialists and press are making
                            strong demands for general election on treaty issue. He said that, in
                            principle, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leaders would have liked to have
                            general election on treaty since basic electoral issue could then be
                            whether Japan would be aligned with the US or with Russia. This would
                            have been useful as giving proof Japanese people support alignment with
                            US and new treaty and would clear air and stabilize <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> regime. However, leadership has
                            avoided this course believing that consequent delay in accomplishing
                            ratification would have been effectively exploited by Communists and
                            created impression of doubt re US-Japan relations. He added that
                            Socialist talk of “mass resignations” is absurd. It may sound all right
                            as propaganda but many individual Socialists would fear being
                            defeated.</p>
                        <p>As to future, Funada said with treaty approval now assured, demands for
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to step down will grow
                            stronger both within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> and without.
                            While late October or early November had been in prospect for election
                            of party president, sentiment is growing within ranks to settle issue
                            and have election much sooner, that is, not long after Diet closes in
                            mid-July. He said that, while very capable, experienced and courageous,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> unfortunately is not
                            popular and some still attack him for having been member of Tojo
                                cabinet.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Hideki Tojo (1884–1948),

                            Public has now developed general image in thinking of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, just as with leaders like
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> and Hatoyama,<note

                            youth, intellectuals, and the press are particularly critical of his
                            past association with Tojo and war.</p>
                        <p>Funada said that in some ways it might be in <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s own best interest to step down. In light of the
                            events in Korea, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> must avoid
                            any impression that he is determined, like <persName>Rhee</persName>, to
                            hang on indefinitely as Prime Minister, come what may. However, Funada
                            freely admitted there is as yet no logical successor to <persName

                            is capable but not noted for breadth of vision. In short, while he
                            anticipates growing sentiment for <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> to step down, Funada has no answer to the problem
                            of a successor, but he believes <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> is now facing great difficulties insofar as future
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> government is
                            concerned.</p>

                            thing which would upset 30-day rule is Diet dissolution which government

                                corresp="#p_MT3">Miki</persName>, Matsumura, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_IM1">Ishii</persName> calling for him to resign;
                            Socialists and leftists mounting massive daily demonstrations against
                            him; and anti-governmental press bitterly attacking him. Ohno, <persName
                                corresp="#p_IM1">Ishii</persName>, and Ikeda (all of whom have
                            aspirations to be PriMin), although they supported <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> in voting on treaty, are now
                            sitting on fence. If they should join forces with anti-mainstream group
                            in calling for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to resign it
                            is difficult to see how <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            could survive. And if <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Govt
                            falls before treaty is ratified and enters into effect, although legally
                            case can be made that ratification vote of lower house on May 20 stands,
                            as practical matter it is difficult to believe that final ratification
                            would not be very seriously jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>Key at present is <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>. If he will
                            get off fence and stand firmly with <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> until treaty is ratified and enters into effect,
                            both Ohno and Ishii will probably stand firmly with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> also.</p>
                        <p>However, if <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> joins with
                            anti-mainstream in asking <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to
                            resign, both Ohno and Ishii will almost certainly go along with him.</p>
                        <p>In light foregoing, I suggest you get in touch with <persName

                            playing into hands of pro-Communist and neutralist elements in Japan
                            that would like to see imminent collapse of <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> Govt with treaty ratification also going down
                            drain. You should say that if anything happens to treaty it will be
                            greatest victory Communists could gain in Asia and terrible blow not
                            only to US-Japan relations but particularly for Japan itself. <persName

                            troubles that have arisen in Japan over the ratification of the
                            Japan-U.S. security treaty. He said <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> is in great difficulty and may not be able to
                            continue in office. He said that there is a proposal to urge <persName
                                corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName>, who is now visiting the United
                            States, to throw his support behind <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>. The President thought this was a good idea, and
                            authorized an approach to be made. The President said this may well mean
                            that his plans for visiting Japan may have to be modified. He gave to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> the gist of a
                            message which he thought should be sent to <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> at once to get his advice.<note n="2"

                            The President mentioned briefly some of his thoughts concerning
                            additional countries to visit on such a trip, naming Indonesia, the
                            Philippines and Formosa. He thought he would have to spend a minimum of
                            two days each in Indonesia and the Philippines, and one day in Formosa.
                            In further discussion, the idea of postponing the trip until a date just
                            following the Republican Convention in late July was developed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he would sound
                            out <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> on this point</p>

                                    target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> question arose as to
                            timing and extent of Presidential visit to Far East. The President asked
                            me to get your tentative thinking on situation, without in any way
                            consulting with Japanese officials, but with following considerations in
                            mind:</p>
                        <p>First, possible continued political uncertainty in Japan as of the date
                            of the scheduled visit. Second, the political situation presently
                            existing in the U.S. which makes difficult the extension of the
                            President’s Far East visit to countries like the Philippines and Taiwan
                            which of course are most anxious for President to call on them during
                            Far East tour. Third, President’s present commitments which include: a)
                            a visit from the King of Thailand in Washington between June 28 and July
                            1; b) the necessity of his keeping the ten days after adjournment of
                            Congress, now hopefully expected July 9, free for the study of
                            last-minute legislation passed by the Congress; c) attendance for one
                            day at the Republican Convention, possibly on July 26 or 27.</p>
                        <p>Above factors have led President to wonder whether an alternate time for
                            visiting Japan as well as other Far East nations at a date immediately
                            after the Republican Convention appearance might be possible. Naturally,
                            President would not want to make any move which would be embarrassing to
                            Japanese Government during its present difficulties, but also would not
                            wish to visit Japan if political situation made such visit difficult for
                            the Government. Your earliest reply would be very much appreciated.</p>

                        <p>The President telephoned with regard to the Far East trip to say that if

                            Japanese will feel about this. The Secretary said he had sent a wire to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> asking for his

                            which the Secretary briefly described to the President, reporting

                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>’s response and
                            the Secretary said he would send these telegrams right over to the

                            in view of this trip it might look as though it had been postponed
                            because of this left-wing trouble maker. The Secretary said <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> may be taking this into
                            consideration which accounts for our not yet having this evaluation. The
                            Secretary said, however, that he agreed entirely that there is urgency
                            in determining this. The President said if the opposition is strong
                            enough, his trip might be embarrassing to <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, but, on the other hand, <persName

                            come it would appear that state policy is being dictated by his
                            opponents. The Secretary said he had asked <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>, at this point, not to talk to the Japanese,

                                    159</ref>.</note> I have considered carefully the factors
                            relating to President’s visit to Japan contained in your 2763. The
                            considered judgement of myself and key members of Embassy staff is that
                            it would be great mistake for President to take <pb n="304"
                                xml:id="pg_304" facs="0334"/>initiative in postponing his visit to
                            Japan. We feel that for us to propose postponing visit would give
                            appearance of bowing to Communist and leftist threats and pressures in
                            Japan and would be portrayed as victory for pro-Communist anti-American
                            forces here. Furthermore, for us to take initiative in proposing
                            postponement would probably be generally considered by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s opponents within Conservative
                            Party and by press as evidence that we think <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> is finished and we are disengaging from him. This
                            could be mortal blow for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> who
                            is in real trouble.</p>
                        <p>In light of foregoing my recommendation to you and President is to
                            authorize me on “purely personal basis” to approach <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> at once and ask him whether, in
                            light of present domestic political situation, from <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> viewpoint postponement of visit would
                            be desirable. When we have <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            answer we would be in substantially better position to assess this
                            possibility. If there were a postponement of visit it is of utmost
                            importance that the initiative be that of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>If approach to <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> on “personal
                            basis” is authorized would appreciate reply soonest since I would like
                            to put this to him soonest. It is of utmost importance that there should
                            be no public indication at this time that we are wavering on visit.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Takeo Fukuda</persName> (Agriculture Minister
                            and one of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s closest
                            confidants) called on me privately this afternoon to give me his account
                            of his recent negotiations with Soviets in Moscow re salmon fishing. At
                            conclusion his account of Moscow talks, he said he wanted to talk
                            personally and confidentially about President’s visit to Japan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> indicated that he personally
                            felt that in light of recent evolution of Japanese domestic political
                            situation, timing of President’s visit <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305"
                                facs="0335"/>might not be of the best. As matters now stand,
                            President is scheduled to arrive on day security treaty is finally
                            ratified by Japan and conjuncture of these two events might give
                            leftists pretext to mount demonstrations which might mar President’s
                            visit and be unpleasant for him. <persName corresp="#p_FT1"
                                >Fukuda</persName> said this possibility troubles <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, whom he sees daily, as latter
                            greatly admires and respects President and wants nothing to interfere
                            with success of his visit, although he very much wants President to
                            visit Japan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> asked me on “strictly
                            personal basis” whether President’s visit might be postponed for ten
                            days or two weeks, so that ratification and entry into effect of treaty
                            would have been accomplished. I said I could not answer officially, but
                            personally I felt this was out of question because of visit to US of
                            King of Thailand June 28; Congressional adjournment early in July
                            followed by ten-day period for President to review Congressional
                            legislation; and Republican Convention late in July. I added, however,
                            that I felt postponement to somewhat later date, perhaps in August,
                            might be feasible and even desirable if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> believed timing was not good, and if <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> wished me on strictly confidential
                            basis to explore this possibility, I would be glad to do so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> himself felt that on balance
                            postponement would be desirable. To advance date of President’s arrival
                            in Tokyo wouldn’t really solve problem of timing, since until treaty is
                            ratified and enters into effect, leftists may be expected to continue to
                            agitate. <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> was most emphatic
                            that there should be no cancellation of visit and that initiative for
                            postponement should be with <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>. If it
                            were agreed to postpone, it would be extremely helpful if approximate
                            date of postponed visit could be mentioned in general terms–for example
                            “sometime in August"–when postponement was publicly announced.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_FT1">Fukuda</persName> asked me not
                            to mention to anyone that he had discussed this matter with me since I
                            gathered he has talked only to <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> about it and that latter has not been in touch
                            with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>. Fukuda said he hoped to

                                >Fujiyama</persName>. He said that following <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName>’s report, question of
                            postponement of President’s visit had been discussed by both <gloss

                            were varying opinions within Conservative Party, after careful
                            consideration <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> believed that it was best for
                            visit to proceed as planned with President arriving June 19,</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> explained that in
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s and his considered
                            judgment present Communist offensive against <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> by Soviet Union, Communist China, and leftist elements
                            within Japan had three basic aims: (1) to defeat treaty, (2) to oust
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> who is regarded by both
                            Soviets and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s as public enemy
                            no. 1 because of his staunch stand favoring US-Japanese partnership, and
                            (3) to forestall indefinitely President’s visit to Japan. Present
                            campaign against <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said, being master-minded and
                            supported in many ways by <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s and
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is determined to press through
                            ratification of treaty although until treaty is ratified and enters into
                            effect there will be undesirable difficulties and disturbances fomented
                            by pro-Communist elements perhaps even including general strike. However
                                <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is determined to push treaty
                            through.</p>
                        <p>With respect to President’s visit while <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>
                            recognize that there may be some demonstrators along road from airport
                            waving red banners and like and while there might be certain “other
                            undesirable scenes” <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is certain that
                            it can fully assure safety of President and that there is no personal
                            risk involved for him.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said that he
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> felt that President’s
                            visit as scheduled would strengthen substantially elements in Japan that
                            favor Japanese-American partnership and would be of material assistance
                            with respect to public opinion in connection with all aspects of
                            Japanese-American partnership including new treaty.</p>
                        <p>I replied to <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> that I fully
                            appreciated considerations which he had outlined. However, I must tell
                            him frankly and on purely personal basis that I had some reservations
                            and felt that further consideration <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"
                                facs="0338"/>should be given by himself and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to possibility of postponement. I
                            went on to say that if there were demonstrations against President even
                            though his personal safety were not involved an image might be created
                            in United States and elsewhere of hostile anti-American Japan. In their
                            efforts to drive wedge between Japan and US, creation of such an image
                            was, I felt, one of basic objectives of Communists in addition to three
                            objectives which he had mentioned. I also wanted to mention another
                            consideration as result of what had transpired recently in Paris.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Reference is to the collapse of the summit
                                meeting, May 16-17.</note> I had seen comments in American press
                            indicating that there is body of opinion in America that believed
                            President should not travel abroad if it is clear in advance that
                            situations may arise which not only create embarrassment but strike at
                            dignity of Office of President. I said while pro-Communist elements will
                            have continued capability to create disturbance if they so desire
                            whenever President visits Japan, some people think that June 19 visit is
                            bad timing because of conjuncture of President’s arrival with entry into
                            effect of treaty. Given announced leftist intentions, this would seem to
                            make inevitable disturbances. On other hand if visit were postponed
                            until end of July and early August leftist forces would have no such
                            pretext and if they then demonstrated they would be universally
                            condemned by public opinion everywhere.</p>
                        <p>I said that it would be one thing if it were question of cancellation of
                            President’s visit as this might be interpreted as great victory for
                            Communist elements in Japan. However, we were talking about postponement
                            not cancellation or indefinite putting off of visit. The proposition is
                            that if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> so desires, postponement
                            could take place but in announcement of postponement it would be
                            specifically stated that visit would take place “last few days of July
                            and early days of August.” Under these circumstances I did not think
                            postponement could be exploited successfully as leftist victory to
                            detriment of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and his
                            government. I concluded by asking <persName corresp="#p_FA8"
                                >Fujiyama</persName> to be good enough to consult again with Prime
                            Minister and give him my personal views and considerations which I had
                            put forward.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said that he would gladly
                            do so. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> in reaching conclusion that it would be
                            best for visit to proceed on schedule had been thinking largely in terms
                            of Japanese picture and Japanese public opinion whereas I had introduced
                            several other considerations which were important. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> said that in concluding visit
                            should proceed as scheduled on 19th. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            planned to have treaty voted by upper house by about June 10, even
                            though opposition would not be present, so that final ratification by
                            both houses of Diet would be completed before President’s arrival. Under
                            these circumstances <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> feared
                            among <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0339"/>other things that with
                            Japanese ratification completed postponement of President’s visit on
                            Japanese initiative might be used by <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s opponents to charge that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> was merely trying to postpone
                            visit in order to prolong life of his government. Nonetheless he would
                            try to see <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> tonight and would
                            in any event see him and be in touch with me by tomorrow morning.<note

                            to Japan June 19 as planned. President’s willingness to come is most

                            from current United States policy toward Japan. The paper anticipates
                            that Japan will have in the coming years a growing impact on the balance
                            of power in Asia and play an increasingly influential role in
                            international developments. The paper emphasizes that the key to
                            assuring that Japan will exercise its growing international role in
                            concert with Free World interests lies in the satisfaction of its need
                            for expanding trade and, consequently, access to a free and reasonable
                            share of United States and other Free World markets. Because of Japan’s
                            heavy dependence on the United States, militarily and economically,
                            United States policy can have a critical impact on Japan’s international

                                    will be prepared for some years to undertake such military
                                    activities, <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0343"/>although we
                                    recognize that such an objective is ultimately desirable. It is
                                    recommended that you support the majority position, which
                                    directs that the United States only respond positively to, but
                                    not stimulate, initiatives in this direction by Japan since any
                                    effort to induce a regional security role by Japan is likely to
                                    be both counter-productive and ineffective. In the unlikely
                                    event Japan does take an initiative to participate more actively
                                    in the military defense of the Free World, we anticipate
                                    requests for military assistance above the levels set forth in
                                    the financial appendix.</item>

                                        the directive by the President that the Secretaries of State

                                    they are essential to our security interests, leaving the way

                                    Ryukyus. The State position is to accede to these requests when
                                    reasonable and consistent with our security interests, while
                                    Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would consider
                                    such requests sympathetically. While the language in the two
                                    positions is very close, there is a basic difference of
                                    viewpoint between State and Defense on this question. In
                                    practice, Defense has only reluctantly agreed to Japanese
                                    requests for closer relations with the Ryukyus. For example,
                                    this year they have refused to continue a program of sending a
                                    few Japanese teacher-consultants to the Ryukyus although such
                                    assistance is needed and is desired by the Ryukyuans. We feel
                                    that failure to permit the Japanese to assist the Ryukyus in
                                    this very limited manner, which will not affect our security
                                    interests, will only lead to increased reversionist pressures
                                    and serious strains in United States-Japanese relations. It is
                                    recommended that you support the State position.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> pointed out that the
                            Secretary of Commerce and the Acting Secretary of Labor were present for
                            consideration of the draft statement <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315"
                                facs="0345"/>of policy on Japan (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            6008). He suggested that Mr. Amory might wish to summarize recent
                            developments in Japan before the Council turned to consideration of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6008.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Amory said that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> was determined that he would not resign and would
                            not dissolve the Diet. The active vocal opposition to the security
                            treaty with the United States probably represented a small minority of
                            the Japanese people. However, the chances of <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> retaining office are diminishing, as a result of
                            his handling of the riot in the Diet and his failure to get his case for
                            continuance in office thoroughly accepted by the people. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is counting on the President’s
                            visit to Japan to restore his prestige and make it possible for him to
                            dissolve the Diet and call new elections in the fall. If the current
                            riots do not cease, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> may be
                            compelled to abandon his ambitions for a third term. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s enemies within his own party are
                            mainly preoccupied with eliminating <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>; they seem to have no substantive objection to the
                            security treaty. If the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            government loses power and is replaced by another government, it is
                            probable that relations between Japan and the United States would not be
                            materially affected except that the new Japanese Government might be
                            more favorable to Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. <persName>Amory</persName> reported his belief that the
                            Japanese Government would be firmly in control of public order during
                            the President’s visit to Japan. The President said his visit would be
                            quite a good will visit, but he supposed the situation could be
                            worse.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then briefed the Council

                        <p>After reviewing the background of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            6008, and referring briefly to the General Considerations and the
                            Objectives, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> turned to the
                            first split in the paper namely, that in paragraph 44,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d168fn9">See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note>
                            dealing with the defense mission of the Japanese armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought there was
                            no great substantive difference between the alternative versions of
                            Paragraph 44. He felt strongly that any effort to stimulate Japanese
                            thinking along the lines described in the Defense–<gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal for paragraph 44 would have a
                            very bad effect on Japan. We had already had serious problems with
                            respect to the security treaty and efforts to increase the military
                            capabilities of Japan. One of the bases of Japanese acceptance of the
                            security treaty has been the principle that Japan would not be required
                            to fight in Far Eastern wars. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> believed that while the ultimate objective of the
                                Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal was a laudable
                            one, the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> language <pb
                                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0346"/>was too strong. He suggested
                            the Council might wish to adopt the middle course by a sentence which
                            would read “Until conditions permit, take no action to stimulate Japan
                            to participate more actively in the defense of Free World interests in
                            the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Douglas</persName> believed that Secretary Dillon’s
                            remarks had not quite answered the hope reflected in the Defense–<gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version of paragraph 44 that Japanese
                            defense forces might become effective beyond the immediate area of the
                            Japanese islands. Secretary <persName>Douglas</persName> attached some
                            importance to mention of this geographical factor in the paper, but he
                            could not get excited about substituting “as conditions permit” in the
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in view of the troubles in Japan at present, and
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> government’s efforts to
                            support us, he thought we had better be sure that we made no mistakes.
                            He believed the State version of paragraph 44 was preferable. We should
                            remember that this policy paper will be studied by our Ambassador and
                            our Military Attachés, who will ask “What does this paragraph mean?”
                            When the time comes to extend the Japanese defense mission, the decision
                            that the time has come should be made by the National Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> remarked that
                            some military observers believe Japan is slipping away from us; that we
                            are being too nice to Japan and will ultimately lose our shirts there.
                            The President said that once we recognize the fact that Japan is an
                            independent country, we can only keep Japan on our side by being nice;
                            being too firm might lose Japan as an ally. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> believed that Japan was
                            objecting to most of the military actions we wanted to take in Japanese
                            areas, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. The President said he would rather have Japan as
                            a friend than as an enemy. This was a matter of first importance. He
                            felt it was necessary to be cautious at the present time. In three or
                            four months, if <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> succeeded in
                            his efforts to stay in power the mission of Japanese military forces
                            might be reviewed and, if necessary, changed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> turned to a split in
                            paragraph 45, which dealt with the question of grant military assistance
                            to Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said his own
                            feeling was that both versions of paragraph 45 went too far in trying to
                            establish a policy which would last for some time. The difference
                            between the alternative versions, as reflected in the Financial
                                Appendix,<note n="10" xml:id="d168fn10">Not printed. (Department of

                            next fiscal year. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> was strongly of the opinion that the present was
                            a poor time, after the internal struggle in Japan over the security
                            treaty, to ask Japan when we could stop making new commitments for grant
                            military <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0347"/>assistance to Japan.
                            Immediately after the ratification of the security treaty, we intend to
                            negotiate with Japan the latter’s $600 million <gloss

                                    202</ref>.</note> Secretary Dillon thought the $600 million
                            involved in <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> were more
                            important than our expenditures in military assistance. After the <gloss
                                target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> negotiations are completed, it
                            might be possible to discuss with the Japanese Government a reduction in
                            our military assistance commitments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> admitted that the
                            State Department version of paragraph 45 might be somewhat extreme, and
                            wished to suggest an alternative. He recalled that a report on <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2158<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d168fn12">See <ref target="#d167fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    167</ref>.</note> was due in August. He suggested that paragraph
                            45 be modified by eliminating both alternative versions and substituting
                            the following: “Bearing in mind the ultimate objective of eliminating
                            grant military assistance, continue such assistance for the present.”
                            Grant military assistance to Japan could then be considered again in
                            connection with the report on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action
                            No. 2158 this summer, and if new commitments to Japan were not ended as
                            a result of such consideration, the matter could be considered again
                            each year.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether there was any understanding or any commitment
                            between the United States and Japan as to grant military assistance made
                            during the course of the security treaty negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said there were
                            no such commitments. However, the United States has a definite program
                            of cost-sharing to increase Japanese capabilities so that we can phase
                            out U.S. forces now stationed in Japan. In fact, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed that an effort to
                            eliminate new commitments for grant military assistance to Japan might
                            result in retention of our forces in Japan for a longer time and at a
                            greater cost than would be necessary if grant military assistance were
                            not ended at an early date. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said there was an implied commitment to Japan
                            that we would continue for a year or two with our cost-sharing program.
                            We should help Japan in building F–104’s, P2B’s, and missiles for air
                            defense. However, if the State language of paragraph 45 were adopted,
                            the Council would not be approving any particular financial plan for the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said he
                            realized it was difficult to talk about ending commitments for grant
                            military assistance at a time when our relations with Japan were
                            somewhat precarious. However, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action
                            No. 2158, taken last August, provided that we would take steps at the
                            earliest feasible time to end new commitments for grant military
                            assistance to nations able to pay for their own military forces. Under
                            this Action, <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0348"/>no new commitments
                            should be made or implied except through prescribed procedure. The
                            Treasury version of paragraph 45 suggested that consultation between the
                            United States and Japan should take place, but did not propose that our
                            commitments be phased out until three years had elapsed. Moreover, our
                            expenditures for military assistance to Japan would not become minimized
                            until six years had elapsed. Under the Treasury language, consultations
                            with Japan might even be postponed, since there was no provision
                            indicating when such consultations would be feasible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> understood that
                            the Country Team in Tokyo had worked out a six-year program, and had
                            discussed it with the Japanese in contravention of the instructions in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action No. 2158. Now it was
                            argued that any attempt to change the program of the Country Team would
                            place us in an adverse political position vis-à-vis Japan. Less that
                            1-1/2% of the Japanese GNP and less than 10% of the Japanese budget had
                            been devoted to military purposes since the end of the war. Japan was in
                            a favorable position with respect to gold holdings and liquid dollar
                            assets. If the principle that nations able to pay for their military
                            forces should do so was to be applied, we must begin some time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> felt that three
                            years was not an unreasonable period for phasing out our commitments for
                            grant military assistance to Japan. He also suggested that the words “as
                            soon as feasible” might be substituted for “promptly” in the Treasury
                            version of paragraph 45. Finally, he agreed with the view expressed by
                            the President, that the National Security Council should decide when it
                            is feasible to begin making changes in our military arrangements with
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that the timing provision in paragraph 45 might
                            read “when declared feasible by the President”. He asked whether Japan
                            was in a favorable budgetary position at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said that
                            during a period when Japanese GNP rose from $17 billion to $30 billion,
                            defense expenditures rose from $283 million to $436 million. The
                            percentage of the Japanese budget devoted to defense declined from 12%
                            to 7.87% between 1953 and 1958. The President inquired whether the
                            Japanese budget was balanced. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                                >Anderson</persName> said he did not know whether Japan was
                            operating under a balanced budget or was running a deficit.</p>
                        <p>The President said he felt the Japanese GNP was carrying a great load. He
                            pointed out that if the country had a starvation diet to begin with,
                            even a considerable rise in GNP was not very significant. He noted that
                            the United Kingdom was attempting to balance its budget by austerity
                            measures, but was experiencing considerable difficulty. A similar
                            comment might be made about Argentina.</p>
                        <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said he thought
                            the Japanese standard of living had improved. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said per capita income in Japan
                            was high for a Far Eastern country–about $300 per year. He added that he
                            had no great difficulty with the drafting proposals made by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName>. The word “promptly”
                            had upset the State Department. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> saw three ways to improve the U.S.
                            balance-of-payments position and help the U.S. taxpayer so far as Japan
                            was concerned: (1) an increase in Japanese defense expenditures; (2) a
                            favorable <gloss target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement; and (3)
                            a reduction in our military assistance to Japan. Only the last item was
                            fully under our control. With respect to the question whether we were
                            committed or not committed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> wished to say that the United States had made no
                            commitment to Japan as a result of the Country Team’s activities. We did
                            not have to follow through on the Country Team’s five-year program,
                            which was prepared in response to one of the recommendations submitted
                            by the Draper Committee<note n="13" xml:id="d168fn13">The President’s
                                Committee To Study the U.S. Military Assistance Program chaired by
                                    <persName>William H. Draper</persName>, Jr.</note> and approved
                            by the President as a world-wide method of programming military
                            assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                            he did not know whether the Country Team had in fact talked with the
                            Japanese about this program.</p>
                        <p>The President said one of his first experiences in office had concerned
                            the question whether we were committed to make a large loan. He had
                            carefully read all the papers on the subject, and had come to the
                            conclusion that the good faith of this country had been committed to the
                            extent of $300 million. The President felt that once a Country Team
                            makes a favorable comment on a program, the foreign country regards that
                            favorable comment as a commitment. He believed we must instruct our
                            Country Teams to remain non-committal when discussing future programs
                            with our foreign colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> doubted that our Country
                            Teams could formulate satisfactory programs unless they were permitted
                            to discuss these programs with our foreign colleagues. The President
                            said he had no objections to such discussions; but the Country Teams
                            should be careful not to make commitments. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> thought that discussions slipped
                            imperceptibly into commitments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Douglas</persName> then read (from the Defense
                            Comments in the Financial Appendix of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 6008) a paragraph which indicated that the only formal
                            U.S. commitment to Japan was an agreement relating to the production of
                            F–104 aircraft. This paragraph also stated that the United States had
                            indicated an intent to support Japanese plans for certain <pb n="320"
                                xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>weapons to a point where failure to
                            provide such support would present considerable difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The President said the word “formal” should be underlined in the
                            paragraph Secretary <persName>Douglas</persName> had just read. It was
                            the indication of intent that the President was complaining about. The
                            Country Teams should be cautious; their conversations should be
                            exploratory and should not indicate intent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> suggested that the timing
                            provision in paragraph 45 might read “as soon as deemed by the President
                            to be feasible”. The President agreed that we might say “when determined
                            to be feasible by the President”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then explained the
                            divergence of views in paragraph 51 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 6008, dealing with U.S. control over the Japanese
                            islands enumerated in Article 3 of the Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The President said he seemed to be constantly fighting words, but he did
                            not see much difference in the two versions of paragraph 51.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said he feared the
                            Planning Board had done a poor job in drafting the paper in that case,
                            since a real difference of opinion existed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Douglas</persName> agreed that paragraph 51 reflected
                            a difference of opinion. He said the Department of Defense felt that the
                            Majority version invited immediate discussion as to whether the present
                            degree of U.S. control over the islands in question was essential to
                            U.S. security interests. The Defense version of paragraph 51 settled the
                            question for a few years at least.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> was fearful lest
                            the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version settle the
                            question for a hundred years. He could conceive of situations arising
                            wherein Japan would expand its whole security system in the Far East in
                            return for relaxation of some of our control over the Ryukyus. He
                            thought the language of paragraph 51 should be broad enough to enable us
                            to make changes in the degree of control we exercise over the islands if
                            such changes were in our security interest. The Defense language made it
                            impossible to modify our control, even if such modification should be in
                            our interest, as long as international tensions persist in the Far
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said this question was the
                            subject of weekly controversy between the Departments of State and
                            Defense. It had been one of the first things he had to deal with when he
                            became Assistant Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The President felt there was no difference between the two versions of
                            paragraph 51 as he would interpret them. As long as there was a
                            Communist threat in the Far East, it was not in our security interest to
                            relax our control over the islands.</p>
                        <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that each
                            request for a relaxation of U.S. control over the islands was relatively
                            modest in itself, but that a series of relaxations would result in
                            seriously undermining our control.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that paragraph 51 might indicate that we would
                            retain the present degree of control over the islands for the duration
                            of international tensions in the Far East and in the absence of changes
                            in the U.S.-Japanese security treaty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that under
                            the Defense language we would have to maintain the present degree of
                            control over the islands as long as international tensions exist in the
                            Far East, but under the State language minor changes were possible. He
                            preferred the flexibility permitted by the State language.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered why we should control the Ryukyus–indeed, why we
                            would want to–in the event Japan became quite powerful. In this event we
                            would have to accede to Japanese wishes regarding the islands.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> believed it was
                            necessary for the United States to control these islands in order to
                            control the Far East. He feared that a relaxation of our control would
                            eventually result in the loss of Okinawa. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> wished to make it clear that the
                            State Department was not suggesting the relinquishment of Okinawa.</p>
                        <p>The President said the security treaty with Japan had been drawn up in
                            the light of the Communist threat. Accordingly, paragraph 51 might
                            contain the clause “under conditions now prevailing and as visualized in
                            the security treaty”. He agreed with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> that the Communists might be a
                            threat in the Far East for a hundred years. Japan could become so
                            powerful that our garrisons on the Japanese islands would appear
                            puny.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then explained the spirit
                            in paragraph 52, dealing with Japanese requests for closer relations
                            with the Ryukyus in such areas as trade, cultural relations, provision
                            of economic assistance, and the interchange of nationals.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was inclined toward the Defense version of
                            paragraph 52, which said that Japanese requests should be considered
                            sympathetically consistent with U.S. security interests.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> was also inclined
                            to agree with the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> version of
                            paragraph 52 if “sympathetic consideration” had a real meaning. Last
                            year, however, the Army had cancelled a program for the provision of a
                            small number of Japanese teachers for the Ryukyus, although teachers
                            were badly needed in that area. Actions of this nature had resulted in
                            State formulating the rather extreme position found in the State version
                            of paragraph 52.</p>
                        <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>The President remarked that State would probably like the Defense version
                            to read “consider sympathetically and, if feasible, favorably”. The
                            President then suggested that the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> version of paragraph 52 should be adopted, and that a
                            note should be made in the Record of Action of the Council’s
                            understanding that “considered sympathetically” means taking a positive
                            attitude toward the Japanese requests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called the attention
                            of the Council to paragraph 60, which was concerned with Japanese trade
                            practices.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered why this question was in an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper. He was particularly concerned
                            about the detailed provisions relating to pirating of designs,
                            infringement of patents, and cartels, as well as unfair business
                            practices. Many people thought that cartels were not unfair at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that an attempt had
                            been made to comprehend all our policies toward Japan in this paper.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if paragraph 60 remained in the paper it might as
                            well have a paragraph on tariffs and <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that paragraph 57 did
                            in fact deal with tariffs and <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President believed that a large number of things were being covered
                            under the label of national security. He wondered whether economic
                            policies of this kind should be in an <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> paper. Council proceedings were supposed to be secret
                            advice to the President. If the Council discussed the policy relating to
                            trade practices, infringement of patents, and so on, and our policy on
                            these matters was later made public, then the privileged character of
                            Council advice to the President would be violated.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said we were
                            attempting to assist Japan economically as well as in security matters.
                            The economic paragraphs in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6008 were
                            part of the effort to build up Japan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reported that as
                            a result of his visit to Japan,<note n="14" xml:id="d168fn14"><persName

                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> had directed the West German
                            Government to change its trade policy toward Japan. Last week a West
                            German-Japanese trade agreement had been signed opening West German
                            markets to Japanese goods.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was still concerned about including in an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper as much detail as appeared in
                            paragraph 60. Some of the economic policy in the paper should be more
                            “visible”; perhaps this policy should be incorporated in another
                            paper.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> explained that if it were
                            necessary to make any of these policies public, they could be published
                            as Presidential policy without reference to the fact that they had been
                            recommended to the President by the National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether it was the duty of the State Department to
                            negotiate with Japan concerning the pirating of designs, and so
                            forth.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that this
                            matter was something of a joint State-Commerce responsibility; the State
                            Department negotiated with Japan with the support of information
                            supplied by the Department of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>The President said another difficulty with presenting economic details in
                            an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper was that the Department of
                            Commerce was not normally a part of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> mechanism.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said the policy
                            paper on Hong Kong was largely economic.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> said the Hong Kong paper was not on the agenda of
                            this Council meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> believed that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s report on the
                            Japanese-West German trade agreement was very important. If Japan was to
                            become self-sufficient, it would have to have markets in addition to
                            those in the United States and Canada. He wished to applaud the fact
                            that Japan and West Germany had signed a trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that European countries in conversations about the
                            Outer Seven were inclined to shy away from talking about Japanese
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that West
                            Germany in one jump had changed from a country which was lagging behind
                            in relations with Japan to a country which was now very favorable to
                            Japanese trade.</p>

                                energetically developing mass momentum for strikes and rallies

                            Associated Press report Akira Iwai (Secretary-General of Sohyo General
                            Council of Trade Unions) told press June 3 that Sohyo will stage “giant
                            demonstration” in presence of <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">James
                                Hagerty</persName>, White House Press Secretary, during his visit to
                            Japan next week. Iwai also told press that demonstrations during
                            President’s visit are “likely” and said he is “still apprehensive that
                            some physical violence may occur.”</p>
                        <p>Labor Ministry official June 3 commented on Iwai press statement by
                            pointing out that Sohyo has been planning to hold “May Day-like” central
                            rally in Tokyo sometime around June 11 (reference telegram). Iwai’s
                            statement was probably designed to give specific target to that rally
                            and attempt to contribute to general build-up of momentum of campaign
                            during next three weeks. Ministry also informed Embassy June 3 that it
                            has received report that several thousand Zengakuren (Federation of

                            at Haneda when Hagerty arrives. Sohyo Unions not expected to participate
                            in that demonstration as organized element. Ministry attempting to
                            confirm report on Zengakuren plans and will keep Embassy informed.</p>
                        <p>Re Iwai’s reference to possibility of violence during President’s visit,
                            Embassy has been told by several Sohyo officials that orders against
                            violent demonstrations against President will be issued to all Sohyo
                            Unions. Zenro (Japanese Trade Union Congress) official and Labor
                            Ministry officials TODU stated that violent demonstrations by unionists
                            are unlikely, since unions estimate such acts would turn Japanese public
                            irrevocably against union; all observers have remarked, however, that
                            Zengakuren is always potential source of violence.</p>

                                transportation during morning rush hours in Tokyo and other major
                                cities. Zengakuren students, the telegram continued, were expected

                            Following is our preliminary and tentative report on and estimate of
                            effect of Sohyo-called general strike June 4:</p>
                        <p>Strike of railway workers which lasted from 4 am to 7 am went off without
                            hitch and caused considerable inconvenience to commuters. There were no
                            reports of any major violence and no serious adverse reaction of public
                            has yet been evident.</p>
                        <p>Since strike was actually illegal but nonetheless was pulled off as
                            advertised without serious public adverse reaction, Sohyo and Socialists
                            are claiming it as great victory and are contemplating another similar
                            but more widespread strike on June 17 or 18. On other hand, Govt is
                            claiming victory, pointing out: (a) that there was no enthusiasm or
                            revolutionary fervor on part of strikers (indeed some of railway
                            operators would not have joined strike unless they had been abducted by
                            Sohyo); (b) that public did not support strike and reason it did not
                            react adversely was because strike was in early morning and only lasted
                            three hours; (c) that even pro-Socialist Asahi has strongly condemned
                            strike and that <persName corresp="#p_NS6">Nishio</persName> Democratic
                            Socialists have also made public statements strongly opposing and
                            condemning it; (d) that stock market which dropped before strike
                            recovered immediately after conclusion of strike June 4; and (e) while
                            Socialists claim five-and-half million participated, public security
                            info agency reports that only 750,000 were involved.</p>
                        <p>It is still too early to gauge longer term effect of strike on Japanese
                            people. We believe on balance Socialists and Sohyo came out a shade
                            better because they successfully pulled off an illegal strike without
                            strong public reaction and are encouraged to try it again on broader
                            scale about June 17. On other hand, if press and Democratic Socialists
                            continue to condemn such political strikes, Socialists may not actually
                            try it again June 17, and indeed if they do it is possible but not
                            certain that Japanese public, which accepted one such exercise, will
                            itself become increasingly critical.</p>

                        <p>The President telephoned with regard to his forthcoming trip to the Far
                            East. The Secretary said with regard to General van Fleet<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d171fn1">General James Alward Van Fleet, U.S. Army,
                                Commander of the U.N. forces in Korea, 1951–1953.</note> that, as
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned, our area
                            experts thought his accompanying the President might be embarrassing
                            because of van Fleet’s known close association with
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>. The President said he wasn’t unaware of
                            that but, on the other hand, he seemed to be like Jose Rizal or
                            something. The President said what he is worried about is this thing
                            building up in Japan; that he was not disturbed by the people in
                            Congress or on TV who think they know better, but that he was disturbed
                            as to whether <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> may be making
                            a mistake in using the President for an internal thing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we have gone into this very carefully; that he didn’t
                            think <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> has much a chance of
                            hanging on. Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            has identified himself so much with this Treaty, but that it is the
                            ambitious people in his own party who feel that three years is enough as
                            Prime Minister that are making <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>’s life the most miserable. The Secretary mentioned
                            the wire from <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>
                                yesterday<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">In telegram 4042 from Tokyo,

                                that he learned from Funada on June 4 that the Japanese Government
                                expected special groups of “friendly demonstrators” totaling about
                                200,000 to 300,000 to line the route between the airport and the

                            reporting the large group of students and others who have volunteered to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to be out there cheering
                            for the President. The President said he knew there would be no attempts
                            to physically harm him, but he said the only thing he wonders is how far
                            the United States can take the risk of having its President embarrassed
                            and, therefore, embarrass their country. The President said he was
                            almost getting to the point of feeling he ought to see whether his own
                            country feels he is making a mistake. The Secretary said he knew the
                            President’s concern and said we have the same concern and have been
                            watching it carefully. The Secretary said he thought the President
                            should continue with his plans but be prepared at the last minute if the
                            situation changed in Japan to defer this. The President said he is going
                            to take the rest of the trip anyway, but he would not want to cancel the
                            Japan portion after he had started on the trip; that if Japan is to be
                            cancelled this should be announced before the trip. The Secretary <pb
                                n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0358"/>said such cancellation would
                            happen only if the responsible Government in Japan recommended the
                            President not come, but the Secretary said he thinks they have things
                            under good enough control; that there is an important issue here as to
                            whether these troublemakers should be allowed to get away with something
                            but, on the other hand, we have the President’s own situation very much
                            in mind. The Secretary said he thought that there will be a
                            demonstration, but mentioned that in the last by-election on May
                                19th<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">A reference to the by-election for

                                Central Files, 794.00/5–1960)</note> where the whole issue was on
                            the Treaty, the candidate supporting the Treaty won by 75% on this
                            issue. The President said he is anxious that the people of Japan
                            understand the purpose of an American delegation going to Japan is to
                            pay respects to a sister democracy and to celebrate with them their
                            Centennial and not to try to be appearing as a supporter of a Treaty, of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, or anything else. The
                            President thought it might be helpful if we could put this idea across
                            before his arrival and mentioned the Secretary perhaps making a
                            statement when he leaves here. The President said he is worrying because
                            he wouldn’t want a big effort such as this to be a flop; that if it
                            proved futile people would say he wouldn’t listen to warnings. The
                            President mentioned Fulbright’s comments in the Press.<note n="4"

                                1960.</note> The Secretary said he had told the Foreign Relations
                            Committee in Executive Session that the question of postponement had
                            been gone into and the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            Government felt a postponement would look like giving into this pressure
                            group and it was felt the President should therefore go ahead. The
                            Secretary said the Committee felt the decision was a wise one and was
                            completely sympathetic. The President said he was trying now to get
                            together a speech for the Diet, but it is a sorry thing when you think
                            you are going in there with armed guards at the doors.</p>

                            present over-all assessment of probable Japanese reaction to President’s
                            visit is as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. We must expect strong demonstrations against President by
                            pro-Communist groups, including Socialist Party, Sohyo, Nikkoso, and
                            various Communist-front groups in line with Moscow’s hard line. Moscow
                            and Peking are committing all their available reserves to present
                            internal struggle in Japan to defeat security treaty, and in particular
                            they are opposing President’s visit as they fear that it will prevent
                            them from turning anti-<persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and
                            anti-security treaty struggle into nationwide anti-American movement. In
                            other words we should be encouraged by fact that Communists estimate the
                            President’s visit will strengthen Japanese-American relations and hinder
                            present Communist offensive in Japan. As we all know, because of
                            developments in Japan timing of President’s visit is unfortunate because
                            of conjuncture of his arrival and treaty ratification June 19 which
                            gives pretext to leftists for demonstrations. (However <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> hopes to have Upper House ratify
                            by June 16 or 17.) While it is too bad there will be demonstrations, as
                            long as President’s personal safety is not compromised, I think we
                            should view pro-Communist demonstrations in same general light that we
                            view Khrushchev blasts.</p>
                        <p>However, overwhelming majority of Japanese people are friendly to US and
                            appreciate great assistance we have given them since end of war which
                            has helped them so greatly in their reconstruction. Furthermore,
                            Japanese people are traditionally extremely polite and friendly to
                            visitors. We believe they will receive President with friendship and <pb
                                n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0360"/>courtesy. While except for
                            extremists Japanese are notoriously undemonstrative publicly, we think
                            that if leftists overdo their opposition to visit many Japanese will
                            feel called upon to applaud President vigorously to counteract possible
                            impression in American and foreign eyes that he is not warmly welcomed
                            here. We know <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and certain members of
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> are working quietly to this end
                            with important groups who themselves spontaneously wish to give
                            President warm welcome.</p>
                        <p>As result of meetings I have had with press and public information media,
                            business and political leaders, I think press will also soon begin to
                            call on Japanese people to welcome President warmly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> is also working on newspaper
                            owners. There has been so much confusion here and so many reports about
                            postponement that press has not come out in favor of visit yet for
                            reasons I indicated earlier in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                            4081 and also because they feel visit may strengthen <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> whom they hate blindly. However,
                            we believe there will now be good press support for visit although I am
                            not yet certain press will take strong stand against Socialists re
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>Despite foregoing, Zengakuren will make major effort to create unpleasant
                            demonstrations against <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
                            when he arrives here Friday and there will not be restraints on such
                            demonstrations against <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
                            that there would be on similar demonstrations against President (see

                        <p>Many people who are friendly toward US, while not wishing President to
                            back down and postpone visit because of Communist pressure, at same time
                            have been very much afraid of very adverse reaction in America if there
                            are demonstrations against President. Some (particularly intellectuals)
                            also considered the timing bad and fear it will enmesh President in
                            political struggle going on here. They have suggested postponement of
                            two to three weeks, but when it is pointed out that Communist opposition
                            to visit will hardly change in that period and prospect will be for
                            demonstrations even then, they reluctantly agree that this is true. On
                            other hand, a number of Japanese leaders in business and politics feel
                            that great struggle is now taking place in Japan, on outcome of which
                            depends Japan’s future political orientation (either with West or
                            neutralism) and that President must go through with his visit and not
                            give Communists victory by postponing. In past three days a number of my
                            diplomatic colleagues, including Asians and Westerners, have asked me
                            anxiously about reports that President might postpone his visit and have
                            all stated that it is imperative (A) that President go <pb n="331"
                                xml:id="pg_331" facs="0361"/> through with visit as planned, and (B)
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Government stand firm
                            in ratifying treaty, as backing down to Communists will create domino
                            reaction in free Asia.</p>
                        <p>Number of anti-mainstream <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> leaders
                            have been calling for postponement of visit since they feel President’s
                            visit may somehow bolster <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>. I
                            have talked with some of them and now that it is crystal clear that
                            President will proceed as planned, I believe most will climb on band
                            wagon and say that President’s visit is welcome, although I do not
                            expect either <persName corresp="#p_IT2">Ishibashi</persName> or
                            Matsumura to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>I of course realize how concerned you all must be in Washington,
                            particularly in view of very alarming and perhaps sometimes exaggerated
                            reports in our press. For example, such demonstrations as have thus far
                            occurred in and about Embassy have been relatively calm affairs with no
                            revolutionary or deep anti-American fervor evident even among some of
                            Zengakuren students. I will continue to keep you informed, of course,
                            about reactions to visit, but we here on firing line feel that situation
                            with respect to Japanese press has now turned and that with knowledge
                            that visit will take place as scheduled there will be increasingly
                            strong support from majority of press, prominent leaders and
                            personalities, and public favoring President’s visit.</p>

                            this afternoon we were of the unanimous opinion that despite fact there
                            were demonstrators along road to Tokyo we should proceed as planned in
                            my car rather <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>than sneak out of
                            airport by helicopter. For if the leftists were going to resort to force
                            and violence it was better for Japanese and US to know now rather than
                            when President arrives. Furthermore I felt that if force and violence
                            were used against us, there would be a deep feeling of revulsion on part
                            of the great majority of Japanese which would seriously blunt the
                            pro-Communist offensive here.</p>

                            students closed in on us stoning the car, shattering the windows,
                            cutting the tires and trying to turn us over.<note n="1"

                                American Embassy went into “a condition II, standby to destroy

                            impossible to proceed further by car the police eventually cleared a
                            path for helicopter to pick us up and we arrived at Embassy without
                            further adventure and with none of the party suffering any real damage

                            Foreign Minister will have special radio-TV broadcast tonight and since
                            there were number of photographers in the melee around car I am sure
                            action shots will be quite graphic. I personally feel that Japanese
                            press, intellectuals, business leaders and Conservative Party have long
                            needed some real shock to shake them out of their passive acceptance of
                            use of force, violence and illegal action by a militant pro-Communist
                            minority which is trying to paralyze parliamentary Govt and democracy in
                            Japan. I am hoping that Japanese reaction to this incident will be
                            similar to Japanese reaction to the violence on May Day 1952 and that
                            net result will be a major setback for Communist cause in Japan.</p>

                        <p>2951. Eyes only for Ambassador. All of us here greatly regret indignities
                            to which you, <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> and
                            Stephens were subjected, and rejoice that no one was injured. As you no
                            doubt realize impact of Japanese Government’s failure to deal adequately
                            with widely predicted situation is having serious impact on public
                            opinion in this country and raises yet more serious questions for us. I
                            should add that growing anxiety is again being expressed on Capitol
                            Hill.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me and others in the Department that Japanese police were
                            either unwilling or unable to handle this situation. I understand Secret
                            Service has reported in same sense to White House. This opinion is
                            supported by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            on difficulties of handling Presidential visit under present
                            circumstances, and said he had advised Prime Minister that visit should
                            be postponed. Later message indicates Director General not prepared make
                            full use of police against Japanese people in protecting President.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> should be so
                            informed.</p>
                        <p>If serious incident or rioting should take place when President is in
                            Japan, likely result would be strong revival anti-Japanese feeling in US
                            with resultant grave adverse effects on Japanese-American relations.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> (who claims not
                            to be close enough to situation to have definite view on advisability of
                            trip now) pointed out that if a bad incident were to occur it might
                            destroy at one blow whole edifice of close friendship and partnership
                            which you, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and others have
                            so patiently built up over past ten years.</p>
                        <p>I must tell you that flat failure of Japanese Government to prepare
                            adequately and deal with <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
                            arrival yesterday has caused grave misgivings among all of us who have
                            until now staunchly supported visit in light of basic issues which you
                            have so clearly put forward. We realize fully basic issues are Japanese
                            future orientation and survival of parliamentary democracy, and last
                            thing any of us would wish to do is to deliver Japan into hands of those
                            who would destroy all we have striven for on both fronts. However,
                            President’s visit is only one incident although a highly important one
                            in this struggle. We must squarely <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334"
                                facs="0364"/>face possibility of grave damage which could result at
                            home and abroad from either failing to make certain of an orderly visit
                            or unwisely persisting in what now, on basis hard facts of yesterday
                            seems to be a most different situation.</p>
                        <p>As President has accepted <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            invitation and has reaffirmed his acceptance on basis <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s considered reaffirmation of
                            invitation, we do not wish to take initiative for postponement. We are
                            all the more unwilling because Japanese are in best position to evaluate
                            situation and conclude whether or not they can handle it. We trust
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> implicitly to have best
                            interests of Japanese-American relations in mind and we have no
                            suspicion whatever that his personal situation enters into his
                            calculations at present. We hope that he has received full advice and
                            counsel of those men in Government and elsewhere who according to
                            Kashiwamura and others feel that visit should be postponed.</p>
                        <p>Naturally President himself has no desire to enter into an internal
                            quarrel or to find himself used as a symbol of contending forces in a
                            nation which he is trying to assure of America’s friendship. We are sure
                            Japanese Government has no desire to see dignity of Presidential office
                            so used. We therefore request you to see <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> privately at earliest possible moment and ask his
                            evaluation of situation. You may say that if <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> decides it should be postponed and takes
                            initiative to this end, the President would later on try to fit a visit
                            into a future schedule that is already crowded. He would, however,
                            continue with visit to other countries scheduled for current trip.</p>
                        <p>In placing this question before <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, you will of course have in mind that even if
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> continues to believe
                            visit should take place as scheduled, President would have to reserve
                            his freedom of decision if later on during progress of visit to other
                            countries situation in Japan should so deteriorate as to make visit
                            there obviously unwise from the standpoint of our mutual relations and
                            public opinion in both countries. One possibility which disturbs us
                            considerably is that even if large numbers of friendly elements decide
                            to demonstrate their friendship for President and US, what we will have
                            is a free for all mob scene between friendly and unfriendly elements in
                            which latter are better organized and more combative.</p>
                        <p>You should also consider and discuss with <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> as appropriate in what manner adverse effects of
                            any changes in plan could be minimized and how blame could be thrown on
                            Socialists and those others who have resorted to violence. It seems to
                            us that while nothing could obscure success of those who by violence
                            rendered government impotent and prevented trip, there might well be
                            shock and revulsion on part Japanese people if blame were clearly and
                            forcibly and publicly placed on Socialists and their Communist
                            instigators and backers. This could be used by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to carry through treaty
                            ratification and then appeal to <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"
                            />country through new elections on issue control of violence as well as
                            Western orientation of Japan.</p>
                        <p>In connection with your reply to foregoing and particularly if <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> still desires visit to take place
                            on schedule, we desire your independent appraisal as to prospects that
                            police can and will handle situation efficiently despite their utter
                            failure yesterday. We also would like to have your view as to extent of
                            reaction against what we would consider shocking excesses of
                            demonstrators in seeking humiliate <persName corresp="#p_HJC3"
                                >Hagerty</persName>, Stephens and yourself including what if any
                            practical effect such reaction would have on the violent leftists whose
                            appetite must have been further whetted by their current success.</p>
                        <p>The President has seen this message.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">This
                                telegram was followed at 8:10 p.m. by telegram 2952 to Tokyo, which
                                transmitted the President’s comment that “the purpose of the trip is
                                to reaffirm and strengthen the friendship which we firmly believe
                                characterizes the relationship between our governments and our

                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi></p>
                            <p>1. Japan stands today as a fully independent and influential member
                                of international society. It has made a spectacular recovery from
                                the 1945 low point, particularly on the economic front, and is
                                unique as the only highly industrialized nation in the Asian-African
                                area. Given its demonstrated capabilities and its aspirations for
                                international prestige and leadership, Japan will have in the coming
                                years a growing impact on the balance of power in Asia. The chief
                                task of U.S. policy is to assure that Japan continues to exercise
                                its international role predominantly in concert with Free World
                                interests. The decision on Japan’s international orientation will be
                                made by its own leaders on the basis of their assessment of its
                                vital national interests and domestic political factors, but U.S.
                                policy will have a crucial bearing on this determination because of
                                Japan’s critical dependence upon the United States for defense and
                                trade.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Importance of Japan</hi></p>
                            <p>2. Japan’s dramatic recovery emphasizes its importance to the United
                                States and the Free World. In overall strategic terms, Japan is one
                                of the four major industrial complexes in the world and, if Japan’s
                                industrial strength were harnessed to Communist Bloc power, the
                                world balance of power would be significantly altered. Militarily,
                                Japan is the key to the defense of the Western Pacific against
                                Communist aggression. Her logistic facilities and bases are
                                indispensable to an economical and effective defense of the Far
                                East. Economically, Japan is the second largest export market for
                                the United States and the largest purchaser of U.S. agricultural
                                products; the United States is the largest importer of Japanese
                                goods. Finally, Japan, as an Asian nation, has potential for
                                contributing–particularly in the area of economic assistance–to the
                                development of the many newly-emerging underdeveloped nations in
                                Afro-Asia.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Internal Situation</hi></p>
                            <p>3. Political power in Japan may be expected, barring unforeseen
                                developments, to remain in the hands of the moderate conservative
                                forces, whose policies will be most strongly guided by Japan’s
                                economic interests and the urge to satisfy Japan’s international
                                aspirations. The <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0368"
                                />conservatives enjoy solid majority support mainly by virtue of the
                                inherent conservatism of the Japanese people, their demonstrated
                                success in meeting Japan’s economic problems, and the extremism of
                                much of the opposition, although their position would be threatened
                                if living conditions failed to improve over an extended period of
                                time.</p>
                            <p>4. The principal cause of political instability is the factionalism
                                endemic to the Japanese conservative movement, which can breed
                                ineffectual governments if not curbed. Although the leaders of all
                                factions of the Liberal Democratic Party appear in varying degrees
                                to recognize the necessity of close ties with the West, some have
                                shown serious political irresponsibility in their intra-party
                                struggles for power. As a consequence, conservative governments in
                                Japan have been tempted occasionally to sponsor opportunistic
                                policies, to be less cooperative with the United States, and to be
                                susceptible to appeals based on emotionally-tinged nationalism.</p>
                            <p>5. The chief opposition to the conservative Liberal Democratic Party
                                in the Diet has come from the Socialists, who are dominated by
                                extreme left-wing elements advocating a Communist-oriented
                                neutralism. Recently the minority moderate Socialists split off,
                                forming the Democratic Socialist Party. Although this new party is
                                still in a formative stage, the split may in time offer a
                                broader-based moderate, responsible, center-right Socialist
                                alternative to continued Conservative rule. At present, however,
                                left-wing extremists still outnumber moderate Socialists both in the
                                Diet and in the trade union movement; presenting difficult problems
                                for the United States, since these extremists are strongly
                                anti-United States.</p>
                            <p>6. The Communist Party, though numerically weak, exercises a
                                significant influence over Japanese opinion particularly through its
                                penetration of mass organizations, labor, education and the
                                information media. The ruling conservatives are aware of the dangers
                                inherent in this situation and the prospects are that the
                                countermeasures already begun will keep this Communist influence
                                from significantly increasing.</p>
                            <p>7. Japan has one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the world
                                (averaging 7.6 percent annually during the past three years) and is
                                currently enjoying unprecedented prosperity, with new highs in
                                nearly all sectors of the economy in 1959. While the extraordinarily
                                high rate of investment (nearly 30 percent in recent years), the
                                modern industrial plant, and technical skills of the labor force
                                have contributed to this prosperity, essentially it would not have
                                been possible without the significant expansion of Japan’s
                                international trade and sound governmental fiscal and monetary
                                policies. Increased exports brought about a marked improvement in
                                Japan’s international accounts in the past two years and indications
                                are that this improvement will continue at least <pb n="339"
                                    xml:id="pg_339" facs="0369"/>over the short term. Substantial
                                surpluses on current account were registered and are reflected in
                                relatively high foreign exchange reserves.</p>
                            <p>8. This prosperity enables Japan to contribute to the development of
                                less-developed countries not only through the reparations programs,
                                but also through private Japanese investments and bilateral
                                government programs. Through reparations and settlements of war-time
                                obligations, Japan is committed to provide certain Southeast Asian
                                nations with more than one billion dollars in grants and to
                                facilitate loans and investments amounting to more than $700 million
                                over the next 20 years. Disbursements average about $70 million
                                annually. Other bilateral government programs amounted to about $130
                                million in 1959, and included not only Southeast Asia but also India
                                and some of the Middle East nations. Japanese private investors are
                                also investing abroad in substantial amounts with funds flowing to
                                Southeast Asia, Latin America and even to parts of the United
                                States. Japan does, however, have sizeable external obligations in
                                connection with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_EXIM1">EX-IM</gloss> loans and the prospective <gloss
                                    target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> settlement. Export-Import
                                Bank loans to Japan are of direct assistance to Japanese industry
                                and trade but are primarily a means of expanding U.S. agricultural
                                exports to Japan. <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans have
                                financed essential infrastructure power and transportation
                                items.</p>
                            <p>9. The current excellent state of the Japanese economy, however,
                                should not obscure the fact that Japan faces economic handicaps,
                                including a heavy dependence on international trade which involves
                                factors over which Japan itself has little direct control, and
                                natural resources limited in relation to its population, its
                                industrial development and its importance in world trade. The
                                Japanese economy can be materially affected by recessions in other
                                industrial nations and by the degree of discrimination against
                                Japanese exports. A long history of discrimination against Japan in
                                international trade has caused the Japanese to become extremely
                                sensitive politically to fluctuations in world trade levels.</p>
                            <p>10. Despite the prosperity and a steadily rising level of personal
                                consumption, the standard of living of the Japanese, though the
                                highest in the Far East, is still low by Western standards (per
                                capita GNP is about one-eighth that of the United States) and there
                                are constant pressures to raise it more rapidly. To maintain its
                                economy at a high and expanding level Japan must have continued
                                adequate access to raw materials and to markets for its industrial
                                products, and this access depends largely on the policies pursued by
                                the other countries. In meeting its trade problems, Japan heavily
                                depends upon the United States not only as its most important source
                                of industrial raw materials and largest single market but also for
                                leadership in fostering liberal trade policies throughout the Free
                                World and particularly among the industrial nations <pb n="340"
                                    xml:id="pg_340" facs="0370"/>of Western Europe. If Japan’s trade
                                relationship with the United States significantly deteriorated, the
                                Japanese leadership would consider a shift toward reliance on the
                                Communist Bloc to be the only alternative.</p>
                            <p>11. The Japanese self-defense establishment is presently capable of
                                maintaining internal security and making a limited contribution to
                                the defense of the Japan area against a conventional attack and an
                                even more limited contribution to defense against nuclear attack.
                                The ground forces, most advanced of the three services, can conduct
                                limited defensive operations; the Navy can contribute to
                                anti-submarine warfare as well as to escort and coastal defense
                                operations; and the Air Force has assumed increasing responsibility
                                for the aircraft control and warning system and the air defense of
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>12. The Japanese Government is moving ahead with a defense program
                                which, if carried out, would produce by 1965 small, modern,
                                high-quality military forces, but with no nuclear capability. The
                                present mission of the Japanese defense forces, other than that of
                                supporting the police in the maintenance of internal security, is to
                                participate in the defense of the Japan area. Any expansion of this
                                mission to use those forces outside the Japan area is barred by
                                Article 9 of the Constitution which, as it is presently interpreted,
                                limits the deployment of Japanese military forces to the
                                self-defense of Japan. If the forces develop as planned, Japan will
                                commensurately assume defense responsibilities now borne by the
                                United States, but by 1965 will still have only limited ability to
                                defend Japan against a major attack and virtually no capability to
                                survive an extensive nuclear attack.</p>
                            <p>13. Japanese defense expenditures are extremely low relative to those
                                of other industrialized nations. Although in six years the Japanese
                                Government has more than doubled its defense budget, only about 1.3
                                percent of the gross national product (about 10 percent of the
                                government budget) is devoted to defense. Although a gradual
                                increase in actual defense expenditures will be necessary if the
                                presently projected build-up is to be carried out on schedule, the
                                rate of increase may not be commensurate with the rate of growth of
                                the economy. In the absence of a significant change in the present
                                situation or greater receptivity on the part of the Japanese to U.S.
                                efforts at persuasion, a more substantial increase in defense
                                expenditures is not likely in view of (a) the latent pacifism and
                                the anti-militarism among substantial segments of the populace, (b)
                                the pressures for better living standards in general, tax
                                reductions, and increased social and public services in particular,
                                (c) the need to meet Japan’s growing external commitments, which
                                derives in part from its desire to exert its influence abroad
                                through assistance to less-developed areas, (d) the underlying
                                conviction that Japan is indefensible in a nuclear war, and (e) the
                                lack of a widespread public acceptance <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341"
                                    facs="0371"/>in Japan of the view that forces of the size and
                                capability which the United States envisages for Japan are essential
                                to Japanese security.</p>
                            <p>14. Despite the above, the Japanese Government is accepting the idea
                                that Japan should carry an increasing share of the cost of its own
                                defense. U.S. assistance has been particularly effective in
                                stimulating these increased expenditures and decisions to modernize
                                the Japanese forces. Indeed, it is estimated that the projected
                                increase in Japanese defense expenditures will be attainable only if
                                the United States is successful in utilizing the <gloss
                                    target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cost-sharing technique to induce a
                                maximum Japanese defense effort. Japanese reaction to a phasing-out
                                of U.S. military assistance would depend upon the rate and manner of
                                the reduction. If new commitments were terminated abruptly, the
                                Japanese would probably not only fail to make a compensatory
                                increase in other expenditures but would probably reduce
                                expenditures from presently planned levels, thereby virtually
                                halting any further build-up and modernization of the Japanese armed
                                forces and precluding the gradual assumption by Japanese armed
                                forces of missions now performed by U.S. forces in defense of Japan.
                                Even if reductions in new U.S. commitments were to be made gradually
                                and phased over a period of several years, the Japanese would
                                probably fail to take up the slack for several years at least, and
                                there would be adverse political effects.</p>
                            <p>15. Japan will rely primarily for its security on U.S. military
                                power. The new treaty arrangements provide for the United States to
                                maintain bases and exercise certain rights in Japan for the purpose
                                of contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of
                                international peace and security in the Far East. Therefore, the
                                United States will probably be able to maintain a substantial
                                military position in Japan. [<hi rend="italic">19 lines of source

                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">International Orientation</hi></p>
                            <p>16. In foreign policy there are three courses of action open to
                                Japan: (a) close cooperation and alignment with the Free World,
                                particularly the United States; (b) a course of expedient
                                opportunism where Japan would play the Free World off against the
                                Communist world; and (c) political and economic accommodation with
                                the Sino-Soviet Bloc. Japan is committed at present to a policy of
                                alignment with the Free World and this alignment will be
                                strengthened by the coming into effect of the new Treaty of Mutual
                                Cooperation and Security with the United States.</p>
                            <p>17. Japan, however, can be expected to continue this commitment only
                                as long as it satisfies its vital interests. The most crucial
                                considerations will be Japan’s need for expanding trade and,
                                consequently, for access to a fair and reasonable share of the U.S.
                                market and other Free World markets. In this context, access to the
                                European market and close <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0372"
                                />association with Free World industrial groupings is likely to have
                                an increasing bearing on Japanese policy. The commitment to the Free
                                World is also conditioned upon our treatment of Japan as a full and
                                major ally and Japanese confidence in our ability and determination
                                to deter Communist aggression.</p>
                            <p>18. Japan will be under constant pressures to disengage from its
                                alignment with the Free World. Neutralization or disengagement of
                                Japan is given very high priority by the Sino-Soviet Bloc which must
                                be expected to continue its present intensive efforts to accomplish
                                this objective. The Sino-Soviet campaign will employ every tactic
                                from threats and encouragement of conservative factionalism, to such
                                inducements as trade, territorial concessions, easing of existing
                                fishing restrictions and access to Siberian and Mainland China
                                development. There is already a vocal minority in Japan supporting
                                disengagement from the Free World. In the event of a serious impasse
                                in U.S.-Japanese trade relations, particularly during a period of
                                weak conservative government, the attraction to disengagement could
                                quickly grow based on appeals to national pride, pacifism and
                                anti-militarism, fears of involvement in another nuclear war, and
                                the underlying distrust of foreign military bases. On the other
                                hand, a fruitful relationship with the United States and the Free
                                World is likely over the years to strengthen and solidify Japan’s
                                commitment to this policy.</p>
                            <p>19. Within the framework of its alignment with the United States,
                                Japan, as its power and self-confidence grow, will be disposed to
                                act with a greater degree of independence, shaping its policies to
                                suit its interests rather than U.S. desires. In its relations with
                                the United States, it is likely in particular to seek a larger voice
                                in the framing of Asian policies, and to insist on more U.S. support
                                in breaking down the barriers to access to European and other
                                regional markets and economic groupings. Japan will continue to seek
                                an increasing degree of participation in Ryukyuan affairs, and the
                                presently quiescent issue of U.S. administration of the islands must
                                be recognized as a politically sensitive problem in U.S.-Japanese
                                relations should major issues arise in U.S. relations with the
                                islanders. Another issue which may arise and cause difficulty is
                                resentment over exclusion of Japanese nationals from other Pacific
                                territories under U.S. administration. Japan will devote major
                                effort and interest to strengthening its relations, particularly
                                economic, with the Afro-Asian nations and Latin America,
                                contributing to their economic development and seeking a more
                                prominent role among these nations while exercising a moderating
                                influence against extremism. It is likely to expand cautiously its
                                trade and cultural exchanges with the Sino-Soviet Bloc but to avoid
                                political recognition of Communist China and economic dependence on
                                the Bloc.</p>
                            <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0373"/>
                            <p>20. In sum, Japan will play a role of increasing importance in
                                international affairs, and, assuming its ties with the United States
                                and the Free World remain strong, will be a constructive
                                international force. Its own contribution to Free World strength
                                will be principally as an economic force and as a moderating
                                influence on the Afro-Asian area. Unless there is a significant
                                change in Japanese thinking on military matters, Japan is not likely
                                to enter regional security arrangements, but the availability of
                                logistic facilities and military bases to the United States will
                                contribute significantly to Free World military strength in the
                                Pacific.</p>

                            <p>21. Because Japan continues to be almost entirely dependent on the
                                United States for military security and heavily dependent on the
                                United States economically, the United States is in a position to
                                have a critical impact on Japan’s international orientation and has
                                an opportunity in the coming years to strengthen and make more
                                secure the present U.S.-Japanese alignment and Japan’s commitment to

                            <p>31. Devote special attention to dispelling attitudes unfavorable to,

                                for cooperative development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy;
                                make nuclear equipment and training for peaceful uses available to

                                China into the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>39. Support and encourage Japan in asserting its legitimate

                                and in resisting Sino-Soviet pressures for neutralization and
                                political concessions; do not concede the Soviet Union’s claim to

                                with the provisions of these arrangements, maintain in Japan a level

                            <p>43. Seek maximum cooperation and support from the Japanese Government

                            <p>44. While avoiding pressures likely to be counter-productive,
                                encourage Japan to develop and maintain armed forces capable of
                                assuming increasing responsibility for the defense of the Japan area
                                and thereby, together with U.S. forces, of coping with and deterring
                                Communist aggression in the Pacific. Respond positively to, but
                                until conditions permit take no action to stimulate, initiatives by

                            <p>45. Continue to consult with the Japanese Government concerning the

                                of U.S. military assistance. While avoiding pressures and other

                                Japan’s political and economic stability, encourage Japan to
                                increase its defense effort and to modernize its military forces.
                                Continue grant military assistance for the present, by so doing
                                seeking (a) to elicit a greater Japanese defense effort; (b) to
                                stimulate the modernization of Japan’s military forces; (c) to
                                permit continued U.S. influence over the evolution of Japan’s

                                in Japan. In order to achieve the orderly reduction and early

                                equipment to Japan on a grant basis, undertake, as soon as deemed
                                feasible by the President, consultations with the Japanese
                                Government toward this end. Seek to place new commitments on a

                            <p>46. Consult with the Japanese Government on security and defense
                                matters of mutual interest, using such consultations to develop a
                                better understanding of the common security objectives of the Free

                                efforts, but avoiding direct pressures on the Japanese Government to
                                join collective security arrangements. Broaden arrangements for
                                coordinated U.S.-Japanese military planning and operations of the

                            <p>47. In order to assure the maintenance of specialized logistic
                                capabilities in Japan as required by U.S. security interests,
                                encourage Japan to maintain selected defense and defense-supporting

                            <p>48. Develop arrangements with the Japan Defense Forces for

                                U.S. forces in Japan, continue as appropriate the present discreet
                                and selective efforts to bring about a better understanding and
                                acceptance by Japan of the importance of nuclear weapons in modern
                                warfare.</p>

                                maintain the degree of control over the islands enumerated in

                        <p>I said <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has heaviest imaginable
                            responsibility re visit. If anything should happen to President or there
                            should be bad incident it would be major disaster. I therefore assumed
                            that in light of yesterday’s event <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            is now giving most grave and serious restudy as to its ability to assure
                            President’s security. Additionally and in light of yesterday’s incident
                            both <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> and I pointed out
                            that eyes of world would be more than ever focused on Japan when
                            President comes here with many new implications which would have to be
                            taken into account in order to be certain that visit would advance
                            interests of Japanese-American friendship. It was inevitable that any
                            incident, no matter how trivial, would be greatly exaggerated and blown

                            authorities were re-examining problem having in mind same type of

                        <p>One of <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName>’s subordinates asked
                            on personal basis whether helicopter could be used to transport
                            President from Haneda to Tokyo so as to avoid long drive from airport. I
                            said that if government could not assure President’s security in
                            motorcade from airport and therefore should propose helicopter, I felt
                            personally that it would be better for <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> to ask for postponement of visit. For inevitably,
                            making trip by helicopter would be portrayed in some quarters at least
                            as indication that neither safety of Emperor nor President could be
                            assured in Japan. This it seemed to me would create a deplorable image
                            of Japan in eyes of world and would damage Japanese-American relations.

                                >Kishi</persName> said he would reply with equal frankness for he
                            wanted President and you clearly to know considerations in his mind at
                            this time and his own estimate of local situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said police had missed badly on
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>’s arrival. They had
                            estimated that this type of violence would not take place, and this
                            estimate had been confirmed by their counter-intelligence not inside
                            extremist organizations. It was clear police had made bad mistake.</p>
                        <p>As to significance of President’s visit to Japan he held exactly same
                            views I expressed to him on basis your 2951. If President’s visit could
                            be <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0381"/>carried out fully and
                            without any bad incidents, it would be clear victory over organized left
                            and would greatly strengthen US-Japan ties. But if there were some
                            untoward incident, effect of visit might be exactly opposite. He fully
                            understood this consideration and agreed with it completely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that most important
                            factor in judging visit was personal safety of President. He had studied
                            this element from every possible angle and said to me most emphatically,
                            “We as the Govt of Japan have believed we can absolutely assure the
                            personal safety of the President.” However with respect to some
                            occasional unpleasantness or some action which might be embarrassing, or
                            violate international courtesy, <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> wanted us to know very frankly that he could not
                            assure that such incidents might not occur.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said it was important to
                            understand that police are under strict orders to avoid any direct
                            physical clash with demonstrators unless they were forced into a clash.
                            Their orders are to keep maximum distance and to avoid any physical
                            encounter as long as it was humanly possible to do so. However when
                            President arrives police would have entirely different orders. Govt had
                            instructed them that they were then to take positive and preventive
                            steps, even aggressive steps, and that they were to carry out these
                            maximum security measures despite inadequacies in present police law.
                            Police authorities were now reassessing even these plans in light of
                            deplorable incident which had occurred to Messrs Stephens and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> and every conceivable security
                            precaution was being organized. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> added however that he would not be entirely frank
                            if he did not admit that “police force at this time was not completely
                            adequate because of the police law.” And this was why he was unable to
                            guarantee there would be no embarrassing incident. However again he
                            emphasized that nature of these possible incidents would not affect
                            personal safety of President.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that obviously much more
                            was involved than police considerations. He thought it highly
                            significant that in last several days an entirely new tone of welcome
                            toward President’s visit had begun to appear in press and on part of
                            public commentators. This change in tone and new emphasis on importance
                            of extending appropriate hospitality to President was a factor of
                            greatest importance in judging situation which would exist in Japan at
                            time of visit itself. Moreover, extremely adverse criticism in Japan to
                            airport incident affecting Stephens and <persName corresp="#p_HJC3"
                                >Hagerty</persName> fully indicated that use of such force and
                            violence was strongly opposed by tremendous majority of Japanese
                            people.</p>
                        <p>On political front, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said he
                            had personally issued call to Democratic Socialist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss>) and to Japan Socialist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>) to discuss a supra-party welcome to
                            President and to divorce visit from partisan politics. <gloss
                                target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss> had agreed to meet with him but <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> had not yet accepted <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0382"/>invitation. <gloss target="#t_JSP1"
                                >JSP</gloss> was however very sensitive toward what press and
                            commentators say about it and press opinion is now running very strongly
                            in direction of political truce so that President can be properly
                            welcomed here. In last few days attitude of some of <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> members in upper house had indicated
                            many misgivings inside <gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> to its
                            present hard pro-Communist line and opposition to President’s visit.
                                Intra-<gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> situation was complicated
                            and one or two more days would be needed before <gloss target="#t_JSP1"
                                >JSP</gloss> itself could decide on whether it would cooperate in
                            appropriate welcome to President.</p>
                        <p>As to hard core opposition, <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            said Japan Communist Party and Zengakuren would not in any event
                            cooperate in visit and would continue to carry out whatever orders
                            Moscow and Peking gave them. However if <gloss target="#t_JSP1"
                                >JSP</gloss> in end joined with <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss> in supra-party welcome it would
                            alleviate situation greatly and decision of <gloss target="#t_JSP1"
                                >JSP</gloss> to join in welcome would mean that Sohyo and its
                            affiliated labor unions would also cooperate since <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> would not make this decision unless
                            Sohyo had authorized it. He was not optimistic about <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> making decision and thought there was
                            eighty percent chance it would decline to meet with <gloss
                                target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DSP1"
                            >DSP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> concluded that it would be
                            two or three days before he could make final considered judgment re
                            postponement since it would take this much time to know specifically
                            exact and full additional security plans worked out by police, and
                            attitude of Socialists. He added that if he came to conclusion he must
                            ask for visit to be postponed, it would be vitally important to him to
                            have clear idea about how long postponement would have to be and when
                            President could make later visit to Japan. He asked most urgently that I

                            President’s visit to Japan will be carried through on schedule. However
                            if finally deemed impossible, suggestion your <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss> to delete Okinawa from itinerary requires
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>I believe I understand why you probably think that visit to Okinawa would
                            be unwise and possibly offensive to Japanese if visit of main islands
                            impossible. Would appreciate any analysis this position you may wish to
                            express re this matter which should enter into decision on this
                            contingency. Opinion here is that it would be highly undesirable to
                            allow unfortunate circumstances in Japan to interfere with the visit to
                            Okinawa. There are independent reasons (in addition to the fact that it
                            has already been announced) which would in fact make the visit to
                            Okinawa all the more pertinent if the Japan visit were unfortunately
                            cancelled. Under these circumstances some consideration should be given
                            to its possible extension beyond the brief hour and a half already
                            planned.</p>
                        <p>We would find it extremely difficult to rationalize to our friends abroad
                            and our citizens at home any action which would obviously be interpreted
                            as subservience to Japanese sensitivity. There will be many voices that
                            will suggest that a visit to Okinawa under these rather extreme
                            circumstances becomes the more symbolically important.</p>
                        <p>If Communist minority demonstrations in Tokyo achieve their purpose in
                            dealing us one really devastating blow, there is no reason why we should
                            give impression that they can impose their will upon us with respect to
                            an area in which we retain legitimate rights.<note n="2"

                            orientation and on parliamentary democracy there, he of course hopes
                            reassessment will result in adhering to schedule. As you no doubt
                            appreciate repercussions are of most serious nature for us also in view
                            (1) inevitable world wide bloc exploitation of a second frustration of

                            necessary for new and tougher orders to police to be issued now rather
                            than to allow demonstrators flushed with success to run wild until
                            President’s arrival. Recognize this is primarily <persName

                            to assert itself only when American President arrives may turn reaction
                            against US and may be too late to be effective anyway. At same time we
                            would hope Govt would take other positive measures of leadership which
                            would leave no one in doubt trip will take place and nothing which

                        <p>As we see it, if change is to be made, Japanese must take initiative

                        <p>As a result of foregoing, it is generally agreed (even by some of

                            has become focal point of blame for everything that is wrong in Japan,
                            and therefore he must step down and the sooner the better. We share view
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s position is now so
                            impaired that he cannot continue on long as Prime Minister and that
                            domestic political picture probably cannot be straightened out until
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> at least announces that
                            he will step down after treaty ratification.</p>
                        <p>However, question of who will succeed him remains as obscure as ever and
                            it is difficult to believe that <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                            are exchanged thus delaying entry into effect of treaty. While this

                            However, if before upper house ratification <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                        <p>Japan is target number one in Asia for Moscow and Peking which seek first
                            to neutralize and eventually to absorb Japan. To achieve this objective
                            Communists have launched giant political and propaganda offensive
                            against Japan, an important element of which is to cause Japanese people
                            to believe that their ties with America will lead to war and atomic
                            destruction. Unfortunate U–2 incident was propaganda bonanza for
                            Communists and there seems little doubt they have succeeded to some
                            extent in causing Japanese people to reflect on dangers of war in
                            relation to security arrangements with US. While propaganda from Moscow
                            and particularly Peking has, over past months, been strongly
                            anti-American, it has only been in last two weeks or so that Japanese
                            Communist and pro-Communist supporters and stooges have come out with
                            open anti-Americanism. It seems clear pro-Communists thought time was
                            ripe to transform anti-pact and particularly anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> campaign into massive
                            anti-American campaign, in part by trying to portray US as only force
                            that kept <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> in power. However,
                            use of force by Communists and Socialists, culminating in <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> incident and their naked
                            espousal of anti-American campaign have boomeranged and caused respected
                            leaders and even pro-leftist press to come out with stern warnings to
                            Socialists and others against their anti-American campaign. Socialists
                            sensing public opposition to anti-Americanism ran for cover, issuing
                            stream of statements that they were not anti-American and wanted
                            friendship with US and today Sohyo reportedly says it will not
                            demonstrate against President at airport or on motorcade route. There is
                            little doubt that tide has turned strongly since last Friday<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d180fn6">June 10.</note> airport incident and that great
                            majority of Japanese people are now seriously concerned over efforts of
                            leftists to stir up anti-Americanism. This concern became many times
                            magnified as result of “<persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName>
                            incident” <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0390"/>which shocked and
                            “shamed” overwhelming majority of population. And in Japanese language
                            word “shame” like word “insincerity” has its own special meaning.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, we do not think feeling of friendship toward US on part of
                            great majority of Japanese has been basically impaired as result of
                            political crisis and anti-American campaign of pro-Communists. Indeed as
                            result of shock of airport incident and reports of very adverse reaction
                            in America, press is carrying many articles indicating imperative
                            necessity to Japan of friendly cooperative America in trade, security,
                            and other fields, reminding Japanese people that Japan would not now
                            stand restored were it not for our postwar cooperation and help.
                            Japanese business community and Japanese military are particularly
                            concerned over and opposed to anti-American campaign. However, while
                            basic friendship of Japanese people towards US is not affected,
                            pro-Communists have established a precedent for future use of force
                            against US. However, in view of public indignation, it seems unlikely
                            (except from unpredictable Zengakuren) that they will use violence
                            against us unless over-all situation should turn strongly to their
                            advantage. However, Japanese Communists will almost certainly organize
                            some protest demonstrations against President’s visit.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we agree with qualified observers that majority of Japanese
                            support concept of security ties with US. We believe that because of
                            inept way <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has explained and handled
                            treaty debate, there is little understanding of treaty’s provisions or
                            real meaning for Japan and much confusion over what it is all about.
                            Until Japanese leadership explains clearly to people that basic issue
                            involved in treaty is whether Japan stands with US or is forced into
                            neutralism and eventual absorption by Communists, there will continue to
                            be considerable confused thinking which will be exploited by Communist
                            propaganda although Communists have hurt their own cause by resort to
                            anti-American violence.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion let me emphasize again that great majority of Japanese
                            remain stable, industrious, and middle-of-road people. If <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> stands firm against pressures of
                            pro-Communist elements, and on assumption there will be reasonable
                            solution to present crisis including question of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s successor, there is no reason to
                            believe that long-term stability of Japan should be affected by events
                            of past four weeks. Indeed there are many serious Japanese who say that
                            there has been too much complacency in Japan and lack of knowledge of
                            forces at work here which are trying to destroy democracy and that while
                            recent events, particularly <persName corresp="#p_HJC3"
                                >Hagerty</persName> incident, are deplorable, they have served to
                            awaken Japanese people to certain dangers which they had tended to
                            ignore or underestimate. Therefore they are actually better off by
                            knowing now than they would be if showdown had not occurred.</p>
                        <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0391"/>
                        <p>Such success as pro-Communist forces in Japan enjoyed initially in recent
                            weeks has not stemmed primarily from strength of pro-Communist minority
                            but rather from certain underlying deficiencies in other sectors of
                            national life such as press, intellectuals, trade unions, business
                            leadership, and above all factionalism with <gloss target="#t_LDP1"

                        <p>As result of failure of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to pass
                            treaty through Diet during regular session with ensuing crisis and
                            serious deterioration of <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            position, timing of President’s visit, as we all recognize, is not what
                            we would have wished. On other hand, as long as Japanese and our
                            security authorities believe President’s security is not threatened and
                            that prospect is for relatively mild rather than violent demonstrations,
                            preponderant feeling among Japanese political and business leaders is
                            that it is better for President to come than to appear to back down in
                            face of pro-Communist pressures and threat of demonstrations. Our
                            estimate is that while man-in-street regrets that President’s visit
                            coincides with political crisis which will cast somewhat of cloud over
                            visit, at same time he feels it too late to postpone or cancel visit,
                            and therefore believes all Japanese should extend President warm and
                            hearty welcome. There seems little question that majority of Japanese
                            seem to believe that because of “shame” which has fallen on Japanese
                            because of <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> incident it is
                            up to Japanese to give President even better welcome than normal to
                            demonstrate to US that Japanese people reject anti-Americanism. Many
                            prominent individuals, organizations, including even left-of-center
                                <gloss target="#t_DSP1">DSP</gloss> and Zenro, together with press,
                            have come out with statements strongly calling on everyone to extend
                            time. He feels it too late to postpone or cancel visit and therefore
                            believes all Japanese should extend President warm and hearty welcome.
                            As result there is real change in political and psychological climate
                            and, as noted above, reports that Socialists and Sohyo are backing away
                            from idea of demonstrations at airport and on cavalcade route. In any
                            event Japanese are taking extensive security measures and have
                            instructed police to use any measures necessary including force to cope
                            with demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>Estimate of effect of visit and recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Our present estimate is that effect of President’s visit will not, of
                            course, achieve emotional lift we had originally hoped for, because of
                            present political crisis here. However, it will nonetheless serve
                            extremely useful purposes: <list>

                            might well commit Communist-controlled action groups in Japan to

                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> frankly that on basis
                            of situation as of yesterday I had recommended that visit go forward as
                            planned but that new and deeply disturbing elements had been introduced
                            by last night’s assault on Diet which had changed entire atmosphere and
                            was resulting in serious tension, which might oblige me to change my
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yamada</persName> has called me twice to
                            inform me that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and Cabinet
                            are urgently examining situation and that he would be in touch with me
                            following Cabinet meeting now taking place. Meanwhile reports are
                            circulating that cabinet is seriously considering requesting President
                            to postpone visit.</p>
                        <p>I believe Communists will now commit their reserves to struggle and that
                            there will be continuation of violence on part of Communists up to very
                            time of President’s arrival and perhaps during visit. While I will have
                            final recommendation re visit to make after I have heard from <persName

                                contained a preliminary report of strikes and demonstrations taking
                                place that day. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 894.062/6–1560) See
                                Supplement.</note> Dominant impression of yesterday’s strikes and
                            demonstrations (including worst student violence yet in assault on Diet
                            involving one death and some 600 injured) is that militant-leftist
                            students are beyond all control and constitute serious challenge to
                            govt. In essence, student demonstrations stem from fanatical minority
                            group of students (Zengakuren) thoroughly indoctrinated by their
                            Communist leaders.</p>
                        <p>Problem has been complicated by division of Zengakuren into Trotskyite
                            and orthodox Communist factions with pressures within each group to
                            outdo the other. Police under <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            instructions leaned over backward in recent weeks to keep student
                            demonstrations under control by mere presence, no resort to nightsticks,
                            and above all by avoiding any student martyrdoms, which would provide
                            emotional field-day for leftist press and tender-hearted Japanese
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Sohyo mainstream leadership still partly sensitive to general public
                            opinion and attempting to keep actions of membership within bounds <pb
                                n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0395"/>of public toleration. About 650
                            thousand Sohyo Unionists participated in yesterday’s work stoppages,
                            rallies and demonstrations (against Sohyo’s claim of 5.8 million).
                            Unions were successful in halting freight traffic on national railways
                            in 12 key centers throughout country, and private rail and bus lines
                            were struck from early morning until about 6:30 am, occasioning little
                            inconvenience except to very early morning commuters. City buses and
                            streetcars in Tokyo reduced service about 20 percent before 8:00 am.</p>
                        <p>Only violence reported was clash between Unionists and National Railways
                            security guards at Hamamatsu, where Unionists conducted sitdown on main
                            Tokaido line tracks.</p>
                        <p>Other Sohyo public service workers, including postal workers,
                            telecommunications workers, government office workers, and teachers,
                            limited actions to one hour shop rallies during morning working hours.
                            Essential services were not significantly disrupted.</p>
                        <p>Most of Sohyo’s private industry unions reportedly conducted shop
                            rallies, although small number of workers also took leave to participate
                            in outside rallies and demonstrations. An estimated 160,000 members of
                            coal miners union and metal miners union conducted 24-hour strike, only
                            instance of full strike activity reported yet.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to this quiet and generally ineffective agitation by Sohyo
                            and People’s Council during day was bloody conflict between police and
                            7, 500 Trotskyite mainstream Zengakuren students, who converged on Diet
                            throughout afternoon.</p>
                        <p>While mainstream faction assembled around Diet, smaller group from
                            anti-mainstream demonstrated near Embassy but attempted no violence,
                            later proceeding to metropolitan police headquarters for speeches. Diet
                            was under siege from about 3:30. Before Zengakuren assault on Diet there
                            was a side incident shortly after 5 pm when one of two trucks carrying
                            rightist students bore down on leftist crowd. Melee ensued with police
                            eventually restoring order. Shortly thereafter Zengakuren massed before
                            Diet compound entrance, stormed gates and swarmed into compound in three
                            successive waves, attacking police lines with long poles, clubs, stones,
                            bricks and fire. In first wave students with long poles jabbed police
                            who were behind Diet gates in wave driving them back so that main
                            assault force could demolish gates and open way into Diet compound.
                            Students then set fire to police vehicles. Police fought back with fire
                            hoses, nightsticks and finally tear gas, first time latter used since
                            May Day riot in 1952. About 7 pm, while police battling main body of
                            students at compound gates, secondary force of students gained entrance
                            into Diet employees’ building, doing considerable property damage before
                            being forced out by police. During course of <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366"
                                facs="0396"/>these affrays students seized and turned over or set
                            fire to several police trucks which had formed part of barricade inside
                            Diet gate.</p>
                        <p>Police confirmed death of one woman student<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2"

                        <p>Shortly after midnight June 16 cabinet met in emergency session and
                            issued statement saying violence was planned destructive action by

                            domination.</p>
                        <p>Left-wing leaders immediately sought to blame <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                            house. Statements charged police and rightist “hoodlums” with “violent
                            suppression of peaceful demonstration”. Sohyo SecGen Akira Iwai called
                            police actions “fascist oppression”. <gloss target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss>
                            SecGen Saburo Eda also protested police violence and renewed demand that

                            dissolved. Mainstream Zengakuren Vice Chairman Tokuo Onda called on
                            350,000 students to boycott classes in protest against deaths of
                            “several” students in June 15 riot.</p>
                        <p>Typical of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            rodent-like statement by Kaya, President Tokyo University, which
                            regretted violent incident and professed no sympathy with students, but
                            said Govt should nevertheless reflect on fact that students compelled by
                            beliefs to go to “such extremes”, adding university authorities cannot
                            control students until abnormal situation outside schools is rectified.
                            One Meiji University professor quoted as saying his school should be
                            closed till <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> and metropolitan
                            police chief resign. Professor in Rikkyo University described mob action
                            as “heroic and historic” and urged students to storm Diet again.</p>
                        <p>Japanese press June 16 unanimously condemned excesses of students, but as
                            usual qualified editorial condemnations with admonitions to govt,
                            placing “primary” blame on students and demanding continued “reflection”
                            by govt.</p>
                        <p>Further demonstrations led by Communist-controlled People’s League
                            against revision of security treaty are slated for this afternoon with

                        <p>“June 16, 1960 My Dear Prime Minister,</p>
                        <p>I have just received the news of your government’s decision to request
                            postponement of my projected visit to Japan. I hasten to assure you of
                            my full and sympathetic understanding of the situation that developed in
                            spite of your strenuous efforts to avert it.</p>
                        <p>Further, I accept, without question, your conviction that the visit would
                            now be untimely and could lead to even greater difficulty in your
                            country. Of course I completely concur in your action in releasing your
                            decision promptly.</p>
                        <p>I share your sadness that a violent minority could disrupt the proper and
                            orderly processes of democratic government and compel the postponement
                            of a visit that had no other purpose than to promote good will between
                            the peoples of our two nations. I send to you assurances of my continued
                            admiration and esteem and request that you convey to His Imperial

                            President’s letter to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> this morning he asked me to convey to the
                            President how deeply he regretted and apologized for having had to
                            suggest a postponement of the President’s visit. He was deeply conscious
                            of the fact that President had left for Asia with the firm intention of
                            visiting Japan, and that having to suggest a postponement while the
                            President was en route was an act of the gravest discourtesy and
                            impoliteness to the President and to the people of the United States.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, obviously deeply moved,
                            again expressed his profound regrets and personal apologies. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said that he had really
                            had no alternative. A fanatical minority acting as the agents of Moscow
                            and Peking and completely out of accord with the Japanese people plus
                            some others who are not members themselves of this fanatical minority
                            but who have been influenced by it, have created a situation which
                            challenges the very existence of law and order in Japan. If the
                            President had come under such conditions, some serious incident might
                            well have occurred from actions of fanatical minority which in the end
                            might have resulted in worsening our relations.</p>
                        <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0399"/>
                        <p>Accordingly and with full realization of discourtesy to President and
                            American people and of seriousness of the action, he had had to suggest
                            postponement. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> said however
                            he wanted emphasize that Japanese people remained sound. Great majority
                            of them wanted very much to welcome President but situation had
                            developed so that Japanese public could not properly express its true
                            feelings of welcome and friendship. <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName> said he was firmly determined to take whatever
                            actions were required to oppose forces of international communism at
                            work in Japan. He was resolved to continue his work to establish even
                            closer relations between our two countries and he hoped very much that
                            President would be able to visit Japan at later date. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that President fully understands
                            reasons which made postponement of visit inevitable and how painfully
                            difficult it was for <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to
                            request the postponement. It was clear that Moscow and Peking have
                            committed every asset they can mobilize against <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss>, against rule of law in this country and against
                            Japanese Parliamentary Democracy itself. I said it would be grave
                            mistake to think their use of force and violence would taper off at this
                            point. As consideration of new security treaty by House of Councillors
                            reaches final stage, large scale insurrectionary actions can be expected
                            and <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> will have to be prepared to
                            counter this violence. I noted we had reports today that communist
                            dominated people’s council against revision of security treaty is
                            changing its name to people’s council for abrogation of security treaty.
                            It was evident that use of force and mob violence would continue and
                            that communist apparatus was going all out to smash government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> replied he agreed entirely as
                            to gravity of situation confronting Japan. He fully recognized that
                            communist efforts to prevent President’s visit was only part of
                            integrated campaign Moscow and Peking were carrying out to divide US and
                            Japan. Intensity of their efforts would now be increasing, but <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> and Japanese security authorities now
                            understand the danger and are more prepared to meet threat.</p>
                        <p>I said that until security treaty was ratified it would remain focus for
                            communist force agitation and I stressed to him, as I had to <persName

                            how important it was we exchange instruments of ratification soonest
                            possible following approval of the treaty by our respective legislative
                            bodies. <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> expressed full
                            agreement and said that the treaty would of course by ratified by upper
                            house automatically at midnight of June 18 but it was possible that the
                            House of Councillors would affirmatively vote on the treaty today or
                            tomorrow. It would be necessary for the upper house to pass certain
                            enabling legislation to conform domestic laws with the new treaty. He
                            anticipated that <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0400"/>this
                            legislation (which does require vote by the upper house) could be
                            completed by the early part of next week. He would then wish to proceed
                            with the instruments of ratification immediately. I replied that it
                            seemed very possible that the Senate would approve the treaty by June 20
                            and that we would be able to move as swiftly as he desired
                            thereafter.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>It is with the deepest regret that I was obliged to have Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> convey to you through
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> my request
                            that you postpone your scheduled visit to Japan on the historical
                            occasion of the Japan-United States Centennial.</p>
                        <p>As the Foreign Minister explained, the overwhelming majority of the
                            Japanese people eagerly awaited your visit in this memorable year with
                            high expectations. On my own part, I exerted every possible effort to
                            make preparations which in every way would be fully consonant with the
                            significance of your visit.</p>
                        <p>However, in view of the disorderly activities of a misguided and violent
                            minority, I was compelled with painful regret to make the decision that
                            the climate engendered by them, even though it does not reflect the

                            head of state of a nation with which we are on the most friendly terms
                            in keeping with the spirit of the occasion. It is my strong belief that
                            our urgent task today is to continue to fight with unrelenting <pb
                                n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0401"/>resolve the forces of
                            subversion and violence which seek to undermine our freedom and
                            democratic ways of life.</p>
                        <p>I am most grateful to you for your sympathetic understanding of our
                            situation. It is, I assure you, a source of great encouragement to me
                            and to the people of my country.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty the Emperor desires me to convey to you his deep regrets for
                            the postponement and his sincere hope for the pleasure of meeting with
                            you in the near future. His Highness the Crown Prince looks forward to
                            his projected visit to the United States with eager anticipation.</p>
                        <p>The exceptional circumstances in which we are now placed do not, I firmly
                            believe, affect in the least the relations of mutual friendship and
                            trust which bind our two countries. I am confident that the present
                            situation in my country will soon be normalized and that Japan can
                            welcome you to her shores with the traditional courtesy and hospitality
                            of our people.</p>

                            English text of which read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“19 June 1960</p>
                        <p>“Honorable <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D.
                            Eisenhower</persName></p>
                        <p>“President of the United States of America</p>
                        <p>“Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>“It is indeed a great honor to have this opportunity to meet you, and on
                            behalf of the Ryukyuan people I wish to express our profound
                            appreciation for the special visit you are making to our land. It is
                            certainly a true manifestation of the deep interest and concern for the
                            welfare and well-being of the Ryukyuan people which you and the people
                            of the United States hold, and I wish to express my sincere
                            gratification.</p>
                        <p>“Through the assistance of the United States the Ryukyu Islands are
                            making steady progress in social, economic and cultural areas. Our
                            objective is an era of prosperity during the 1960’s as we leave the era
                            of reconstruction seen during the 1950’s. Every effort is being made to
                            carry out the carefully planned objectives and projects.</p>
                        <p>“In order to accomplish these objectives, we require still further
                            assistance and cooperation from the United States. This includes such
                            things as a solution to those postwar claims arising prior to the
                            ratification of the Treaty of Peace which remain outstanding, extension
                            of assistance for which we have made a request through the United States
                            Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands and more expanded autonomy.
                            We should like to extend our sincere appreciation for the assistance
                            which has been rendered up until the present time and request the
                            continuation of such assistance and realization of the foregoing points.
                            In addition, we should like to express our deep and sincere respect for
                            your devotion to humanity and your efforts in seeking world peace.</p>
                        <p>“In order to maintain peace and security in the Far East, it is our firm
                            determination to properly recognize the present position of the Ryukyu
                            Islands in world affairs, to endeavor toward the realization of
                            everlasting peace in the Far East as well as for a continued close
                            relationship between the United States and Japan and thus seek the early
                            return of the Ryukyuan people to their natural status.</p>
                        <p>“In conclusion, Mr. President, we pray for the further growth of
                            friendship between the United States and Japan and for the continued
                            prosperity of the United States.</p>
                        <p>“Very truly yours,</p>
                        <p>“Seisaku Ota</p>
                        <p>“Chief Executive”</p>
                        <p>Following the reading of his letter, Mr. Ota said there were several
                            specific matters which he would like to mention. First of all, he
                            understood <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0403"/>that there had been
                            a cut of $1.5 million from the annual appropriation for economic support
                            of the Ryukyus. This was a matter of concern and he wondered if anything
                            could be done. In response to an inquiry from the President, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLGDP1">Booth</persName> said that this cut
                            had been made by Mr. Passman’s<note n="1" xml:id="d187fn1">Otto E.
                                Passman, Representative from Louisiana.</note> Sub-Committee on
                            Appropriations and that it was most desirable that every effort be made
                            to restore the cut in the Senate version of the Mutual Security
                            Appropriation Act. This appropriation for the Ryukyus had three
                            principal purposes: First, to reimburse the United States Civil
                            Administration for expenditures on behalf of the Ryukyus; secondly, to
                            reimburse the Government of the Ryukyus for similar expenditures; and,
                            thirdly, a variety of economic assistance projects.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1"
                                >Goodpaster</persName> to telephone General Persons <note n="2"
                                xml:id="d187fn2">Wilton B. Persons, Assistant to the
                                President.</note> and ask him to mobilize such support as he could
                            for restoration of the cut. The President then remarked that there had
                            been a restoration of $200 million in military assistance funds made by
                            the House itself when debating the bill as reported by the Passman
                            Committee. Perhaps that took care of the cut. Those present had no
                            definite information on this point. However, in further discussion of
                            the matter, General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDP1">Booth</persName>
                            emphasized that the Ryukyuan support item had been approved by the
                            Bureau of the Budget, was fully supported by the Administration, and was
                            essential for a wide variety of government operations, such as dredging,
                            construction and various other matters normally funded by a central
                            government. At the conclusion of this discussion, the President asked
                            the interpreter to tell Mr. Ota that the President’s party would call
                            Washington about this matter and see what could be done. If the matter
                            could not be handled in one way, perhaps we could find some other way of
                            dealing with it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ota then mentioned the Price bill<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">The
                                Price Bill (H.R. 1157) was signed into law on July 12, 1960, as
                                    <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 86–629. Section 4 of the Act
                                states: “There is hereby authorized to be appropriated not to exceed
                                $6,000,000 in any fiscal year for obligation and expenditure in
                                accordance with programs approved by the President.” For text, see
                                74 Stat. 461.</note> which would provide for an annual expenditure
                            of not more than $6 million annually for economic assistance to the
                            Ryukyus. He said that this bill had passed the House, but not the
                            Senate. General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDP1">Booth</persName> confirmed
                            this and said that the sums provided by this bill would be financed by
                            the federal income tax paid by United States residents of the Ryukyus.
                            The President asked if it was a question of the Senate being opposed to
                            the bill or whether it just had not yet acted. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLGDP1">Booth</persName> said that it had not yet come
                            up in the Senate and he knew of no strong opposition there. The
                            President remarked <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0404"/>that it was
                            late in the session and maybe it was difficult to get the bill on the
                            calendar at this stage. He then directed that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> also bring this matter to
                            General Persons’ attention.</p>
                        <p>A third matter mentioned by Mr. Ota was the Judd immigration bill<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">No immigration bill for the Ryukyus was
                                passed in 1960.</note> under which there would be provision for 100
                            Ryukyuans to go to the United States annually. Mr. Ota said the passage
                            of this bill was very much desired. Those present did not know the
                            status of this bill and the President requested that the State
                            Department and the Immigration Service be queried. In commenting on this
                            legislation, General <persName corresp="#p_BLGDP1">Booth</persName> said
                            that it was related to the broader question of immigration from this
                            area in general. Other countries in the area had token quotas of 100
                            persons a year, but in the Ryukyus where actually we were exercising the
                            powers of a de facto sovereign, there was no provision whatever for
                            immigration to the United States. This seemed rather anomalous. The
                            President then remarked it was very late this session to hope for
                            passage of the bill and perhaps preparations could be made to obtain its
                            passage in the next session.</p>
                        <p>After the foregoing, the President rose to go, but first Mr. Ota showed
                            to him the gifts which were being presented to the President, namely,
                            Ryukyuan lacquer ware and coral. After showing him these gifts, Mr. Ota
                            then handed to the President a large packet containing, he said,

                            last November in Washington, when he expressed his concern that the
                            public in Japan believed that the negotiation of the new mutual security
                            treaty was not receiving high level attention in Washington.<note n="2"

                                November 23, 1959. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                794.5/11–2359)</note> Shortly after his visit, both you and the
                            President issued statements expressing your interest in the new treaty
                            and in close relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of this contact, Mr. Hashimoto was evidently selected as the
                            medium for the communication to you of certain of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName>’s thoughts that he felt would
                            not be appropriate for normal diplomatic communication. His letter was
                            handed to an officer in <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> by an officer
                            of the Japanese Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hashimoto’s letter (Tab D) makes it clear that the Japanese
                            Government agrees with our assessment that the basic issue at stake in
                            Japan is the question of Japan’s alignment with the Free World and the
                            continuing development of closer ties between the United States and
                            Japan. The letter also contains, on pages 3, 4 and 5, a persuasive
                            rationale for the Prime Minister’s handling of the treaty in the Lower
                            House of the Diet. You might wish to give particular attention to this
                            part of the letter.</p>

                                >MacArthur</persName>’s recommendation that you consider showing the

                            situation prompting this recommendation has been so altered by events
                            that there would now be no particular need to bring this letter to their

                            personally to Mr. Hashimoto’s letter. A proposed reply is attached (Tab

                            juncture to try give considered estimate of long term effects on our
                            interests of recent events in Japan, including cancellation of
                            President’s visit and <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>’s
                            announcement of intent to resign. Obviously recent events here may hold
                            serious implications both for US-Japan relations and for US position in
                            Western Pacific but their true import will only be able to be judged in
                            light of how present crisis in conservative <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378"
                                facs="0408"/>leadership is solved and whether from conservative
                            ranks new and courageous leadership will emerge or whether there will be
                            continuation of suicidal factional strife which over period of time will
                            erode away conservative position.</p>
                        <p>It would however be as cardinal an error to conclude that tide of affairs
                            in Japan has either set strongly against close US-Japan association or
                            is now beyond control as it would to minimize long-term seriousness of
                            weaknesses in Japan which events of past week have highlighted.</p>
                        <p>As result of recent unfavorable developments there may be feeling in US
                            that what has happened is in some way result of our policies and that
                            therefore we should change our basic policy towards Japan. Department
                            may therefore wish Embassy’s present tentative assessment of recent
                            events, bearing in mind that, while political temperature is now
                            cooling, crisis is still unresolved and any realistic estimate of longer
                            term future will have to wait clarification of leadership problem within
                                <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> and next general elections.</p>
                        <p>This tentative assessment follows and reviews: (I) Main lines of basic US
                            policy bearing on present situation in Japan; (II) factors accounting
                            for recent events here; and (III) outlook and elements of Japan
                            situation which future US policy will have to take into account.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. Basic policy</hi></p>
                        <p>Our policies in last several years have been based on concept of “new
                            era” through which we have tried to complete transition from occupation
                            to independence of Japan by liquidating residual remnants of occupation
                            policy, and to create with Japan a real partnership based on sovereign
                            equality, mutual respect and mutual self-interest. We not only adopted
                            above “equal” partnership policy but gave concrete and visible evidence
                            to the Japanese people that we are implementing it and do understand
                            their viewpoint by our handling of such matters as: Girard incident,
                            withdrawal of United States ground forces and substantial reductions of
                            other forces, return to Japan of many military facilities, parole of war
                            criminals, change in land acquisition policy in Okinawa, compensation
                            for Bonin islanders, economic cooperation and assistance through
                            offshore procurement in Japan and participation Orissa iron ore project,
                            assisting Japan to get into United Nations and generally trying to
                            advance her international position, and above all by our liberal trade
                            policy on Japanese imports. Our economic policy accorded Japan a fair
                            and reasonable share of our market as premise and precondition for
                            US-Japan relationships in political and security fields and has led to
                            substantial expansion of Japanese exports, making possible Japan’s
                            present economic prosperity.</p>
                        <p>In defense matters we moved to provide for continued presence US ground,
                            air and naval forces in Japan and for continued use of Japan’s <pb

                            We have assisted build-up of Japanese self-defense forces, and in so
                            doing have created a defense establishment in Japan dedicated to Japan’s
                            alignment with free world. This is of great importance for if Communists
                            should resort to massive insurrection in future self defense forces
                            would have to step in (Embdesp 85, July 1959).<note n="2"

                        <p>As result of above policies there has been change in Japanese attitudes
                            toward US from considerable tension existing in our relations in 1957,
                            as a result of Girard case, Japanese desire for reductions in United
                            States forces and general feeling they were receiving unequal treatment.
                            Until security treaty recently became enmeshed in question of <persName

                            several years. Indeed had not image been as good as it is, it seems
                            quite probable that massive efforts of recent pro-Communist offensive to
                            transform anti-treaty, anti-<persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            offensive into great nation-wide anti-American movement might have
                            achieved considerable success. Instead when movement turned to overt
                            anti-Americanism there was immediate reaction against it, even on part
                            of anti-government pro-leftist press and echoed by elements in every
                            sector of national life pointing out that Japan’s present well being and
                            economic progress had been achieved through close cooperation and
                            assistance from United States.</p>
                        <p>We believe strongly that main lines our present policies toward Japan are

                        <p>Basically, events of recent period here seem to us product of combination

                                    This is perhaps best tribute to basic soundness of Japanese
                                    people and to fact that our basic policies of past several years
                                    have been well conceived.</item>

                                <item>At same time fundamental weaknesses of Japanese system remain,
                                    particularly shallowness of experience with and lack of
                                    understanding of democratic mechanisms, particularly in labor,
                                    press and educational fields. There is much latent neutralism,
                                    pacifism, and fuzzy-mindedness in Japan. Intellectual opinion is
                                    too often frustrated or anarchical. Massive Sino-Soviet efforts
                                    to isolate, neutralize, and then control Japan will continue.
                                    Domestic pro-Communist forces, profiting from all this, have
                                    unquestionably achieved short term gain by winning acceptance of
                                    use of force and illegal strikes as political weapon and by
                                    sharpening training, experience, and effectiveness of their

                                    than any post-war Japanese Govt has yet displayed, to explain
                                    facts of life to people, to counter trend toward neutralism and

                                    (particularly among youth and intellectuals), and to assert

                                <item>In sum, hard-core of conservative middle-of-roadism in Japan
                                    still seems basically unaffected by recent events although
                                    unless youth and education straightened out, prospects over ten
                                    to twenty year period are not good. Successor to <persName

                                    this dominant conservative force. Japanese pro-Communist left
                                    seems to have no early prospect of achieving political power or
                                    of drastically altering Japan’s international orientation,
                                    although its power and effectiveness are increasing and if
                                    conservatives cannot pull themselves together long term outlook
                                    is unsatisfactory. Effect of recent events may for immediate
                                    future serve somewhat to inhibit some tendencies evident even
                                    within <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> govt, to move
                                    toward certain types of accommodation with Moscow and Peking,
                                    since many Japanese conservative leaders, shaken by US reactions
                                    will be wary of steps further undermining US confidence in
                                    Japan. Damage to Japanese democracy at home and Japanese
                                    reputation abroad caused by recent events, while very serious,
                                    is within power of Japanese conservatives to remedy, if they
                                    have will and energy to do so. However, only time can tell about

                            to threatened <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> split. Particularly

                            (As reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 133, <persName

                        <p>125. For Ambassador. We assume that at early date you will have
                            opportunity for serious talk with <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> and that he will be interested in discussing
                            problems affecting US-Japanese relations. We recognize that Prime
                            Minister faces formidable task in stabilizing political situation in
                            Japan and particularly unifying conservative elements at present crucial
                            juncture and we do not wish intrude unduly or prematurely. At same time,
                            we believe that if <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> gives you
                            suitable opening it would be most helpful if he could be made aware of
                            developing trends in US opinion resulting from cancellation of
                            President’s visit to Japan.</p>
                        <p>We have been watching closely impact on US opinion of cancellation of
                            President’s visit to Japan. One result to which we believe <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> should give most serious consideration
                            is reaction of business and financial community that political stability
                            in Japan, which was once assumed, has been brought into doubt. US
                            business leaders will be watching future developments in Japan very
                            closely in effort determine reliability of Japan as field for investment
                            and source of imports.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there is now far greater awareness and concern in US re
                            specific ills in Japan, i.e., factionalism, penetration of mass media,
                            educational institutions and key unions, as well as fuzzy thinking and
                            apathy in many parts of body politic. We of course agree with you that
                            these must be cured if Japan’s future as a great independent nation is
                            not to be jeopardized. We recognize at same time that any pressure on
                            our part to seek early solution of these ills could be unhelpful and
                            misconstrued as undue interference. Nevertheless, <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> should be aware that his
                            leadership in handling these problems will be closely watched here.</p>
                        <p>A second major aspect of US concern relates to possible drift of Japan
                            toward neutralism. While we have been seeking counteract speculation
                            along these lines, there remains body of considerable opinion both in
                            and outside US interpreting events surrounding cancellation President’s
                            visit as indication of move towards neutralism. As result, there is far
                            greater sensitivity in US toward <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
                            moves in direction improving Japanese relations with Communist Bloc. For
                            example, reports in US press that <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> favors restoration of trade relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s have attracted considerable
                            interest. We had anticipated prior <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388"
                                facs="0418"/>to May–June crisis pressures in this direction would be
                            intensified in Japan following coming into force of new treaty and had
                            felt that any <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> action would have been
                            placed in context of intercourse with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s by other Free World allies and generally accepted
                            on this basis provided no political strings attached. However, in
                            aftermath of cancellation President’s visit we believe <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> should be aware that moves in direction
                            of trade or technical agreements with <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s may be interpreted by US opinion as further
                            evidence drift toward neutralism. In addition, new concerns are now
                            being expressed re repatriation program to North Korea which some
                            circles interpret as move to appease Communist elements and weaken
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>You should of course reassure <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>
                            that we have every interest in maintaining closest possible ties with
                            Japan. Nevertheless, he should be aware trends in US opinion noted above
                            could inevitably affect economic ties and total US-Japanese relations if
                            favorable image of Japan not restored.</p>
                        <p>We are concerned basically here, as you are, by tendency both Japanese
                            business elements and conservative political leaders to act on basis
                            “business as usual” and downgrade effect of developments during May-June
                            in Japan. Although immediate effect of these developments on our crucial
                            economic relations with Japan has not been too serious, we feel that it
                            will become increasingly difficult to hold the line if public image in
                            US of Japan not improved. That image which perhaps attained all-time
                            high this past winter has as result unfortunate events June dropped
                            disturbingly and comments have taken on critical to unfavorable caste.
                            We have taken care point out Embassy officers here that setback suffered
                            June may in perspective turn out to be only an ephemeral although
                            unhappy experience if the Japanese take necessary steps prove they have
                            not lost sense direction or political orientation and if they bear in
                            mind considerations set forth preceding paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, while we wish avoid placing any direct pressures on <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>, we hope you can quietly lead him
                            and other Japanese leaders to awareness of potentially serious public
                            opinion problem facing Japan in US and fact that his actions, which will
                            be closely observed and fully reported here, could have important impact
                            on future ties between US and Japan. We also discussing situation along

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> sent me word yesterday that
                            he is being followed everywhere (I gathered by both reporters and agents
                            of Socialist Party) and therefore it was impossible for us to meet
                            secretly in Hakone. However, he did wish to have good confidential
                            meeting with me and Yoshida next week, but in meantime asked me to pay
                            brief “courtesy call” as there were one or two things he wished to say
                            to me.</p>
                        <p>I did so this morning and extended to him personal congratulations and
                            best wishes, assuring him that Embassy and US Govt wished to cooperate
                            with him in every possible way to strengthen Japanese-American relations
                            and repair damage caused by recent upheavals. I expressed hope that if
                            there were any problems in our relations or any things which he felt we
                            might do to be helpful in strengthening ties he would not hesitate to

                            to have it next week but possibly it would be following week. He said he
                            wanted President and US Govt to know how deeply and sincerely he
                            regretted <persName corresp="#p_HJC3">Hagerty</persName> incident and
                            cancellation of President’s visit. He realized this had had deplorably

                            particularly wanted to get my ideas as to points Japan should have in

                            good impression but we could talk about that at our next meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> asked me to assure US Govt
                            that he would do his best to implement policies and measures which would
                            rectify situation in Japan which had been so clearly revealed in recent

                            subject to serious misinterpretation. I also mentioned problems which
                            could arise if Japan started large-scale purchases of Soviet oil in

                            neither of these gentlemen was very dependable, he had strongly urged
                            them not to do so, as he was afraid they might start dickering with
                            Soviets on behalf of certain Japanese industrial interests, which would
                            not be helpful and would create additional pressures for favorable
                            credits to Soviet Union. I mentioned that former Vice Parliamentary

                            this morning that he planned to go to Soviet Union and I had poured cool

                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> that I thought his
                            Govt had made excellent first impression both in Japan and abroad. He
                            expressed appreciation and said that most important first step was to
                            have substantial victory in next elections. He was stressing policy of
                            his Govt to improve social welfare of people and strengthen democracy in
                            Japan. He believed he was well qualified to handle Japan’s domestic
                            problems in way calculated to obtain maximum support. Recent elections
                            in Aomori, Saitama, and yesterday in Gumma, were tangible evidence of
                            basic stability of Japanese people and their orientation toward US and
                            free world. He believed his Govt would gain victory in elections next
                            autumn, following which certain corrective measures would have to be
                            initiated by <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> re Japan’s internal
                            deficiencies and weaknesses. While actual dates of Diet dissolution and
                            elections next autumn were “secret” he implied that elections might
                            occur as early as October but more probably November. Between now and
                            August 20 <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would be developing its
                            policies for coming elections, following which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> would take its case to people. <persName

                                >Yoshida</persName> said they fully recognized importance of
                            developing effective means of acquainting Japanese people with basic
                            issues involved in great struggle going on in world today and whys and
                            wherefores of Japan’s various domestic and foreign policies. <persName

                            expert re Japanese domestic political issues, he looked to <persName

                            foreign policy matters. He wished to assure us, however, that Japan’s
                            foreign policy was based on strengthening US-Japan relations, Japan’s
                            firm membership in free world and its total opposition to
                            neutralism.</p>
                        <p>When I spoke about <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relations,
                            particularly importance of finding some way of dealing with repatriation
                            to North Korea short of full one-year extension of Calcutta

                                in Japan and a large number of Koreans in Japan apparently desiring

                                extended another year to November 12, 1961. (Telegram 1293 from

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> said this was very difficult
                            problem and he frankly did not know what would be possible. He had
                            considered fixing cut-off date on registrations some time next <pb
                                n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0424"/>autumn. However he and his
                            advisors believed this might result in great inflation of registrations,
                            with over one hundred thousand, which would mean it would take at least
                            two years to complete physical movement of these persons to North Korea
                            which might be worse than one-year extension of Calcutta Agreement.
                            Politically, it was impossible for any <gloss target="#t_GOJ1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> to abruptly terminate repatriation to North Korea as
                            long as there were substantial numbers of persons desiring to proceed
                            there. He was sympathetic and understood <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> emotionalism on repatriation, but Japan had its own
                            problems with respect to this matter which were every bit as serious as
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> feelings.</p>
                        <p>I also spoke about Okinawan problem in somewhat less detail than I had
                            spoken to <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 310) and mentioned <persName

                            yesterday. Neither <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> nor
                                <persName corresp="#p_YS2">Yoshida</persName> made any particular
                            comment on Okinawan matter, although they listened to all I had to say
                            and agreed that Okinawa must not become problem of serious contention
                            between us.</p>
                        <p>My impression is that <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> is
                            concentrating most of his time, thought, and energy on Japan’s domestic

                            the political upheaval in Japan last May and June, there has now been
                            sufficient <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0425"/>time for
                            intellectual, business and political leaders to reflect on the situation
                            in Japan which underlay the use of force, violence and illegal action
                            and to reach certain conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Many of them have now concluded that Japan badly needed a psychological
                            shock to awaken it from its torpid complacency: (a) with respect to the
                            nature of basic struggle going on in the world today between the forces
                            of communism and democracy; (b) regarding the extent to which
                            international communism not only influenced or controlled “mass
                            organizations” in Japan such as Sohyo unions, Zengakuren, etc. and could
                            bring to bear in a revolutionary type uprising, but also had infiltrated
                            the universities, intellectual circles, and the press; and (c) the
                            wishful hope that the Japanese could quietly sit out the struggle going
                            on in the rest of the world between communism and democratic forms of
                            government without having any real concern about the objectives or
                            effect of world-wide Communist offensive on the internal prosperity and
                            stability of Japan.</p>
                        <p>While regretting deeply the cancellation of the President’s visit (and
                            particularly its effect on Japan’s international standing) a number of
                            intellectual and other leaders feel that the cancellation of the visit
                            was what actually provided the shock necessary to arouse responsible
                            Japanese in all walks of life to an awareness of and a determination to
                            do something about what is and has been actually going on in Japan. In
                            this connection they point out that the pro-Communist forces in Japan
                            have in the past two years twice resorted to peaks of force, violence
                            and illegal actions within and outside of the Diet, and that on neither
                            occasion were Japanese press, public or leaders seriously concerned over
                            the basic implications involved in the substitution of force and
                            violence for the rule of law and parliamentary democracy. (These
                            previous peaks occurred during the abortive police bill debate in
                            October-November 1958 and in November 1959 when Zengakuren stormed the
                            Diet. Additionally throughout entire period there have been steadily
                            increasing efforts by left extremists to discredit Diet and judiciary,
                            to frustrate court processes, to engage in illegal strikes,
                            demonstrations, trespasses and coercive measures.) Just as the Japanese
                            had been complacent about the illegal actions of “the young officers” as
                            they prepared to take over Japan to lead it to destruction in the
                            nineteen thirties, similarly the Japanese had been complacent in 1958
                            and 1959 over the illegal actions and preparations for a take-over by
                            the extreme left.</p>
                        <p>Had not the President’s visit been cancelled as a result of force and
                            violence, many Japanese are convinced that responsible leaders in all
                            sectors of the national life, would have been prone to shrug off both
                            Communist inroads into the schools and public opinion media and the
                            recent illegal actions as being either exaggerated or partly justified
                            as a result of the “bad” or “unwise” actions of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> govt. Had this <pb n="396"
                                xml:id="pg_396" facs="0426"/>occurred there would have been no
                            national awakening, such as has actually taken place, as to the dangers
                            which both (a) democracy and (b) prosperity in Japan face from the
                            pro-Communist elements in Japan which while a minority demonstrated
                            conclusively that they are very well organized and directed and in fact
                            are a real threat to democratic government in Japan. This would have
                            meant that force and violence as a substitute for democracy and the rule
                            of law in Japan would have been further accepted as the norm thus
                            greatly strengthening the potential of the Communist forces in Japan for
                            an eventual take-over.</p>
                        <p>Another important conclusion reached by many Japanese is that the recent
                            events demonstrated conclusively that the policies of the forces of the
                            left who spearheaded the disorders, including both Sohyo and the
                            Socialist Party, are indistinguishable from those of the Communists.
                            Although overt communism in Japan is very unpopular today (less than 2
                            percent vote Communist) the appeals of crypto-communism working behind a
                            front of mass organization and individuals with non-Communist “cover”
                            has had a much wider effect. The abrupt switch in the <gloss
                                target="#t_JSP1">JSP</gloss> line after Khrushchev’s intolerable
                            behavior at Paris, the use of force and violence, including all of the
                            preparations for street revolution, convinced many hitherto trusting
                            Japanese that much of the so-called non-Communist left was actually the
                            captive of international communism. In retrospect for many thinking
                            Japanese the events of May and June in Tokyo have brought Czechoslovakia
                            in 1948 very close.</p>
                        <p>A third conclusion reached by many responsible leaders is that the
                            cancellation of the President’s visit was not in itself a primary
                            objective of the pro-Communist forces in Japan. The basic objective was
                            the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> Govt as
                            a means of blocking and eventually killing the new security treaty. They
                            maintain that the extreme leftists believed that if they could have
                            forced a cancellation of the President’s visit sufficiently in advance
                            of June 19 when final Diet approval became automatic, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> would have had to “assume the
                            responsibility” and in the classical Japanese way of thinking, this
                            could have been used publicly with a good probability of success to
                            “force him to resign immediately.” The fact that the visit was not
                            cancelled until three days before the treaty ratification was completed
                            by the Diet frustrated this strategy as <persName corresp="#p_KN1"
                                >Kishi</persName>, although virtually alone, was able courageously
                            to hold out for this brief period without being forced out of office
                            over the cancellation of the visit.</p>
                        <p>The practical results of these lessons have already begun to have effect,
                            although there is obviously a great deal to do. The new cabinet has
                            quietly but effectively begun to arrest, prosecute, and restrict the
                            leaders of the union, student, and Communist-front mobs. Whether
                            convictions can be obtained in all cases is perhaps less important in
                            Japan where the social and professional stigma of arrest and prosecution
                                <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0427"/>is unusually severe.
                            Moreover, the government is carrying out this program skillfully and
                            with due care for public opinion and civil liberties, so that there has
                            been little opportunity for the apparatus to maintain that either a
                            witch hunt or martyrdom is involved. Plans are being laid for an
                            expansion of police forces, and the emphasis is on the enforcement of
                            existing laws before additional security legislation is sought.
                            Balancing its restrictive measures, the new cabinet is planning, and has
                            adequately publicized its intentions, to deal with causes of discontent
                            by providing assistance for university salaries, employment, social
                            security, and civil service benefits. The press has not only begun to
                            give the government a fairer hearing and to treat <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> and his associates
                            sympathetically, but it has also, and almost for the first time, started
                            to criticize both Communist interventions into Japanese affairs and the
                            immaturity and irresponsibility of Japanese socialism. In the more sober
                            mood of the country, Communist exploitation of this year’s Hiroshima
                            anniversary was limited and controlled (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"

                        <p>How far these present highly favorable trends will be pressed and whether
                            or not responsible leaders in all sectors of the national life will
                            carry through on their present determination to correct the situation
                            inside Japan remains, of course, to be seen. The root cause of Japanese
                            vulnerability remains the factionalism of the conservatives and this is
                            the great task confronting <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName>
                            in the period ahead. However, there is no doubt that as of now many for
                            the first time see clearly and have begun to understand that there are
                            basic internal weaknesses which must be corrected if Japan is to prosper
                            in freedom. The fact that many of them attribute their awakening in
                            large measure as a result of the deep shock and psychological soul
                            searching resulting from the cancellation of the President’s visit
                            without which it would not have occurred, is also of very considerable
                            interest.</p>

                                Visit</hi></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> expressed
                            on behalf of the Japanese Government its deep feelings of regret for the
                            cancellation of the President’s visit. He said that the Japanese people
                            were very grateful for the tolerance and understanding shown by the U.S.
                            since they recognized that the American public was unhappy regarding the
                            cancellation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            replied that the U.S. Government understood the circumstances requiring
                            cancellation of the visit. However, some people in the U.S. have
                            concluded from this development that the U.S. has lost prestige in Japan
                            and that Japanese friendship for the U.S. has declined. He thought that
                            it would be helpful to reassure the American public that this was not
                            the case. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName>
                            agreed fully and said that he would do his utmost to reassure the
                            American public. He pointed out that the <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> Government feels that it is not sufficient merely
                            to express regrets but that deeds are necessary. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> Government considers that the most
                            effective way to demonstrate that U.S. friendship and prestige have not
                            declined in Japan is through a great election victory for the Liberal
                            Democratic Party in the forthcoming Diet elections.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Japanese Domestic
                            Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> discussed
                            the underlying causes for the May-June crisis in Japan. He mentioned,
                            first, that the occupation had drastically revised the legal system,
                            educational system, the position of labor organizations, and the mass
                            communication media. The new Constitution <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399"
                                facs="0429"/>emphasized public welfare and respect for human rights,
                            for example, Article XXVIII, which provides for labor rights. The labor
                            organizations, in the name of protecting their rights under the new
                            Constitution, have undertaken activities which impinge upon the public
                            welfare. They have interpreted the Constitution to permit demonstrations
                            and picketing activity, which on occasion have involved violence and
                            force. Demonstrations of this nature have now become a common practice
                            throughout the nation. The police are, furthermore, unable to cope with
                            these demonstrations since under the Constitution and present laws they
                            cannot step in until an act of violence is on the verge of
                            occurring.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> said that
                            the situation in education is equally serious. The teachers are
                            organized in a trade union whose pattern of activity is similar to that
                            of an ordinary labor union. The Japan Teachers Union is leftist,
                            powerful and one of the key members of Sohyo. The school children have
                            now become accustomed to seeing their teachers participate in mass
                            demonstrations and picket activities and feel there is nothing wrong
                            with such activities. As a result, the student movement has adopted the
                            same practice and has gotten out of hand. In the field of mass
                            communications, <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> said, the
                            major newspapers, which are widely read and very influential, are
                            heavily infiltrated by leftists. Unfortunately, the leftists cannot be
                            fired. However, the business elements in the newspaper world are now
                            trying to reduce leftist influence. The banks, paper mills, and the
                            advertisers are pressuring the newspaper owners to exert a more
                            moderating influence on their papers.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> Government recognizes that they must cope with
                            these basic problems of Japanese society. It feels that the best
                            technique is a careful program of educating the people rather than
                            merely passing new laws. There is a need particularly for public
                            education on the international situation so that the Japanese people
                            will understand the necessity of Free World ties. The Government hopes
                            that through such a program of education it can eliminate the roots of
                            Japan’s internal problems.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. US-Japan Treaty Relations</hi></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> said that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> Government recognizes
                            that the new U.S.-Japan Treaty is very vital and necessary. He said that
                            he had explained to the Diet the Treaty’s necessity and the intention of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> Government to assume
                            full responsibility for the Treaty. He feels that the Government must
                            emphasize that Japan requested treaty revision since certain people
                            believe that the Treaty was forced on Japan. He commented in this
                            connection that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> had been most helpful on the treaty
                            problem.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that recently the Prime Minister had called in
                            the three Chiefs of Staff of the Self-Defense Forces and discussed
                            U.S.-Japanese security relations. One of the key problems that emerged
                            was the question of the Fuji–McNair maneuver area. The Foreign Minister
                            explained that the Japanese Government believes that due to the
                            political sensitivity of this problem and the fact that the U.S. has
                            only used the area occasionally, it would be desirable to return the
                            maneuver area to the Japanese Defense Agency with the assurances that
                            the U.S. forces could use it when necessary. He said he had discussed
                            this problem with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>.
                            He said that another politically sensitive problem in the security area
                            was the transfer of non-appropriated workers to the indirect hire
                            system. This problem is a very technical one and is now being studied by
                            the Embassy and the Foreign Office but requires careful handling due to
                            its political sensitivity. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> indicated that we would give these matters the
                            most careful consideration.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Ryukyus</hi></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> briefly
                            mentioned U.S.-Japanese relations regarding the Ryukyus. He said that
                            under the present situation the Japanese Government did not consider it
                            proper to seek return of administration of these islands and that it
                            appreciated the consideration given by the U.S. to the welfare of the
                            Ryukyus. He mentioned the question of the flying of the Japanese flag in
                            the Ryukyus. He said that the Japanese Government realized that it was
                            permitted to fly this flag over private homes but it would be very
                            helpful if on New Year’s Day, the major Japanese holiday, the flag might
                            be permitted to be flown over public schools and other public buildings.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that we
                            would, of course, carefully consider this question.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Other Matters</hi></p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> briefly
                            raised several other questions. First, he mentioned that several
                            Japanese shipping companies are facing anti-trust actions before a grand
                            jury in New York. He felt that this could have unfavorable repercussions
                            and asked the Department to look into this question from a political
                            viewpoint. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> said that the Department would look into this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Minister mentioned the hope of Japanese business leaders for
                            formation of a joint economic committee in implementation of Article II
                            of the new treaty. He said that the Japanese Government did not support
                            this proposal but hoped that some sort of people-to-people’s forum might
                            be organized to take the pressure off the government. Mr.
                                <persName>Parsons</persName> indicated that we of course would like
                            to consider this problem but that it would appear that the meeting with
                            the Foreign Minister and the subsequent <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"

                            effective means of implementing Article II. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> thought that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Productivity Teams could be construed
                            as another step to implement Article II of the Treaty. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> commented that the
                            Japanese businessmen have not given up the idea of seeking closer
                            economic relations with U.S. businessmen such as exists with Canadian
                            and Mexican business groups. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> pointed out that when Mr. Adachi had proposed
                            a joint U.S.-Japan economic group to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
                            U.S. Chamber had not been too interested. Mr.
                                <persName>Parsons</persName> mentioned that another factor to
                            consider was the need to avoid any U.S.-Japanese organizations that
                            might act in violation of U.S. laws prohibiting restraint of trade.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> suggested
                            that perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName>, while in
                            New York, could explain the Japanese businessmen’s desires to American
                            business groups and that he would do likewise. It was agreed that
                            neither government should discourage such efforts and that both would
                            look into what steps should be taken to encourage closer ties between
                            the U.S. and Japanese business elements.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> opened the discussion
                            of trade problems, mentioning that the U.S. was disappointed by the pace
                            of trade liberalization on <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0432"/>the
                            part of Japan. He said that we were very conscious, of course, of the
                            pressures for protectionism which every industrialized country is
                            exposed to. We recognize that these pressures exist in Japan and hope
                            that the Japanese Government can resist them. There are likewise
                            pressures in the United States for greater protection against foreign
                            imports, and the American Government is therefore engaged in a constant
                            struggle to maintain a liberal trade policy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stressed that the United
                            States Government needs the support of its trading partners in order to
                            resist effectively protectionist pressures from American industries. He
                            urged the Japanese Government to move as rapidly as possible with trade
                            liberalization, since this is vital to the maintenance by the U.S. of a
                            liberal trade policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> expressed the hope that Japan would make
                            progress in this area in the months ahead.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adair pointed out that there was considerable public interest in the
                            trade liberalization question at the present time due to the impending
                            Geneva tariff negotiations and the need in another year for Congress to
                            renew the Trade Agreements Act. He expressed the hope that Japan would
                            in particular reduce the number of items on which they sought tariff
                            increases under Article XXVIII of <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>.<note n="1" xml:id="d199fn1">For documentation on
                                    <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations, see vol. IV,
                                pp. 152 ff.</note> He mentioned that Japan’s resort to Article
                            XXVIII was causing considerable concern in this country and that there
                            were pressures on the U.S. Government to use this Article. However, the
                            US. Government preferred to utilize Article XIX.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> expressed Japan’s
                            gratitude for the expansion of U.S.-Japanese trade, and its awareness
                            that this trade is the key to Japan’s economic advances. He said that
                            the <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> Government recognized
                            the need for trade liberalization and that it was not afraid of internal
                            political pressures against this move. It planned to increase the number
                            of items liberalized from 40 to 80 per cent in the next three years.
                            However, the pace of liberalization will be affected by the peculiar
                            characteristics of the Japanese economy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1"
                                >Kosaka</persName> pointed out that 38 per cent of the labor force
                            are farmers, while 46 per cent work in the industrial sector.
                            Furthermore, factories of thirty or less employees manufacture 97 per
                            cent of Japan’s industrial goods and employ 40 per cent of the
                            industrial labor force. Liberalization will have the most serious
                            adverse effects on agriculture and small to medium-sized business, where
                            the great percentage of the labor force is concentrated and where
                            efficiency is lowest and there is a low rate of productivity.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1"
                                >Kosaka</persName> said, the Japanese plans for liberalization
                            represent a big step forward. The Japanese Government recognizes that
                            the resort to Article XXVIII would result in a slight raise <pb n="403"
                                xml:id="pg_403" facs="0433"/>in tariffs for some items but
                            nevertheless there would be the great increase in trade resulting from
                            the elimination of exchange quotas on these items. He pointed out that
                            the proposed tariff increases were very small; for example, the
                            agricultural interests desired an added 10 per cent duty on soybeans,
                            but this was held to 3 per cent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1"
                                >Kosaka</persName> concluded by urging that we take a long range
                            view of the problems involved in Japan for trade liberalization and
                            recognize, in addition, that due to the forthcoming Diet elections trade
                            liberalization is currently a politically sensitive issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adair reiterated that a bad impression is created by the Japanese
                            request for the renegotiation of tariff concessions previously granted
                            to the U.S. but which have not been effective up to this time because of
                            Japanese quota restrictions. In addition, the Japanese interest in
                            persuading the European trading countries to discontinue application of
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Article XXXV in trade with
                            Japan would be damaged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> referred to the Article
                            XXXV problem and Japanese hopes that the European countries would
                            discontinue its application. He said that Japan is willing to prevent
                            market disruption and flooding of markets through voluntary measures on
                            its part. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> confirmed
                            that the U.S. wishes to assist the Japanese efforts to persuade other
                            countries to discontinue application of Article XXXV in trade with
                            Japan.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> opened the
                            conversation stating that the Japanese Government was pleased that the
                            United States had purchased so much from Japan in 1959 and was also
                            happy to note that statistics of the first half of this year indicated
                            that Japan will be buying much more from the U.S. in 1960. In this
                            connection he stressed the importance to the relations between the two
                            countries of an expanding mutually beneficial trade. He said that the
                            Japanese understood the problems faced in the U.S. as the result of
                            sharp influxes of certain important commodities and was conscious of the
                            need to avoid flooding U.S. markets. He said it was for this reason that
                            Japan had instituted its voluntary export controls for the purpose of
                            orderly marketing in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> responded that
                            the U.S. was appreciative of Japan’s efforts to achieve orderly
                            marketing of its exports. He said that we know that foreign trade is
                            important to the Japanese economy and understand that the Japanese are
                            taking these measures in order to protect an important market in the
                            U.S. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> acknowledged
                            that trade is relatively more important to the Japanese economy than to
                            our own, but said that trade is increasingly important to the U.S.
                            economy. He pointed out that although the U.S. balance of trade is
                            favorable, its balance of payments is unfavorable principally because of
                            our Mutual Security Program. It has therefore become essential for us to
                            emphasize our export program.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> reminded the
                            Secretary of the importance of small business in the Japanese economy.
                            He pointed out that 38 percent of the Japanese labor force are farmers
                            and 46 percent industrial workers. 97 percent of Japan’s industry and 40
                            percent of the industrial labor force are engaged in small business
                            (factories with 30 or fewer employees). This fact causes a number of
                            problems. Small businesses are susceptible to pressures from foreign
                            buyers which sometimes result in copying of designs, etc. To solve this
                            problem, for example, the Japanese Government has established design
                            centers and has taken other measures to avoid unfair competition. The
                            Minister also referred to the problem of the invocation of Article XXXV
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> against Japan by certain
                                <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0435"/>European countries and
                            pointed out that this problem is compounded by the fact that the newly
                            developing African countries intended to carry on the invocation of
                            Article XXXV. Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName>
                            expressed the belief that the application of Article XXXV against Japan
                            had retarded the normal expansion of Japanese trade with Western Europe,
                            noting that Western Europe accounted for less than 11 percent of Japan’s
                            trade as compared with its trade with Africa which amounted to 12
                            percent of Japan’s total trade. He requested U.S. assistance in
                            obtaining the discontinuation of application against Japan of Article
                            XXXV.</p>

                                Payments</hi></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> pointed out that
                            over a long period of time the U.S. has led in the move against the
                            application of Article XXXV against Japan. He emphasized that we have
                            also been trying to obtain liberalization of trade and payments
                            restrictions in general. In this connection he said that we are somewhat
                            disturbed by Japan’s notification of intention to withdraw or modify
                            tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the GATT. He remarked that it
                            is difficult, when answering the complaints of U.S. industry regarding
                            Japanese imports, to explain Japanese restrictions against imports from
                            the U.S. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> noted that
                            statistics for the first six months of 1960 showed a 48 percent increase
                            of U.S. exports to Japan.</p>
                        <p>With respect to trade liberalization Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1"
                                >Kosaka</persName> emphasized that Japan was not retreating from its
                            program for liberalization, emphasizing that action was being taken to
                            remove restrictions on those items in which the U.S. had expressed most
                            interest. For example, he pointed out that pig iron would not be subject
                            to quota restrictions from October and that soon soyabean imports would
                            be liberalized. He said that it was not Japan’s intent to direct
                            restrictions against the U.S. He said the Japanese Government has
                            problems with respect to the farm population as well as small and medium
                            sized business. He pointed out, for example, that the soyabean producers
                            had requested an added 10 percent duty on soyabeans but that the
                            Government had held this to 3 percent. He also expressed the view that
                            although the withdrawal and modification of tariff concessions under
                            Article XXVIII would increase some of the tariff rates this action would
                            result in the removal of quotas on those items, and, in the last
                            analysis, would mean increased trade in the items.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> asked why
                            soyabeans could be produced in the U.S. and transported to Japan cheaper
                            than they could be produced in Japan, where costs are generally low.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> pointed out that
                            in the U.S. soyabeans are produced on a very large scale, whereas in
                            Japan they are produced on such a small scale that the comparative cost
                            is high. The Minister added that Japanese oil producers desire U.S.
                            beans <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0436"/>and are anxious to buy
                            more. He believed that with the removal of import quotas on soyabeans,
                            there will be an increase in imports from the U.S.</p>

                        <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName>’s
                            query, Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName>
                            acknowledged that there was a “clamor” for the revival of Japanese trade
                            with the Chinese Communists by “certain” Japanese. However, he said, the
                            Japanese Government believed this was based on inaccurate knowledge on
                            the part of certain Japanese of the situation within Communist China. He
                            said that Japanese users of certain special materials, such as lacquer,
                            were vulnerable, but they are very few in number. The problem of these
                            users, he said, has been expanded by the press all out of its proper
                            proportion. He said that the Japanese Government is responsible to some
                            extent for not having informed the public more fully about the true
                            situation. On the other hand, the Minister said, the Chinese Communists
                            want from Japan such commodities as cement, rails, steel, etc., for use
                            in building up their own economy. But they want to sell to Japan items
                            such as rice, which Japan does not need. He reiterated that the public
                            should be better informed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> said he had
                            heard rumors that the Japanese Government was investigating
                            possibilities for trade with the Chinese Communists, and he was glad to
                            hear the Minister’s views on this matter. He expressed the view that if
                            the Japanese became dependent upon such a political source as Communist
                            China, trade would become a political, rather than an economic matter.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> remarked that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> Government should have a
                            stronger view on this subject than its precedessor.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> asked about the
                            Arabian Oil Company’s recent approach to the U.S. Export Import Bank.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KZ1">Kosaka</persName> said that this was
                            really a matter within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International
                            Trade and Industry. He said that the Arabian Oil Company was now
                            producing at a rate of about 400,000 kilolitres a year; the target in
                            five years is 10 million kiloliters. In ten years time it is estimated
                            that Japanese demand for crude oil will have reached 96 million
                            kiloliters. With the increasing demand for crude the Japanese hope to be
                            able to obtain some of their requirements without the expenditure of
                            foreign exchange. The Minister did not believe this would have any
                            effect on the investments made by U.S. oil companies. With respect to
                            the matter of Export Import Bank financing of certain storage and

                            Japan, that there was no precedent for making such a loan for oil, but
                            that he would consider it upon his return to Washington in view of
                            Japan’s dependence on trade. He said the Japanese Government hopes some
                            arrangement can be made. He assured the Secretary that the Japanese
                            Government has no intention of causing any damaging effect on U.S.
                            investments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MFH1">Mueller</persName> explained that
                            the policy of the Export Import Bank has been not to make any loans of
                            this kind even to our own nationals, and he pointed out the difficulty
                            which could result from an exception from that policy.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador opened by expressing his regrets that the President’s
                            visit to Japan last June had been cancelled. The President said that not
                            all had been lost. He had received floods of letters from the Japanese
                            expressing their regrets. The Prime Minister of Japan had been included
                            in these letters.<note n="1" xml:id="d201fn1">Not found.</note> Although
                            the politicians had tried to exploit the setback to their advantage,
                            recent developments have more or less put them in their place.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that riots of the same nature had taken place in
                            1958. The disturbances then had been over proposed changes in police
                            laws. Again last January, when the Mutual Defense Treaty had been
                            signed, mobs had stormed the airport and forced <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> to take a back road to his
                            residence. Up to this time the leadership in Japan has been <pb n="408"
                                xml:id="pg_408" facs="0438"/>inclined to brush these matters under
                            the rug. The papers and trade unions had been very tolerant. This
                            incident they could not brush under the rug and all elements are doing
                            something about it. The Ambassador expects that police laws will be
                            strengthened.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued that <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>
                            failed to understand public opinion. His arbitrary actions had combined
                            with the fact that he had been in the Tojo cabinet to bring about his
                            downfall. <persName corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> is different and a
                            big victory for his party is expected in the November election,
                            particularly if he can limit the number of candidates who run in his own
                            party.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought that politicians in this country are little
                            better than irresponsible. The Ambassador agreed. He had had lunch with
                            a Kennedy <note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">John F. Kennedy, Senator from
                                Massachusetts and Democratic candidate for President.</note> advisor
                            and had expressed the hope that developments in Japan would not be made
                            into domestic political issues. He had pointed out that the
                            demonstrations were not primarily against the U.S. The Kennedy advisor
                            had said he would do his best to avoid making this an issue but could
                            make no promises.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his wish that the President could still make the
                            trip to Japan. The President said that <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> had expressed the the same wish in a letter.<note

                        <p>The President pointed out that a trip to Japan would have to be a long
                            one. As a result, he could not stay long. He is booked up for the month
                            of October and for the month of November through the 24th. There could
                            be a possibility of a visit to Japan early in December, although it is
                            still possible he will meet de Gaulle and <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> at that time. He summarized it is doubtful
                            that he can visit Japan while President. For four or five months after
                            leaving the Presidency he might take a trip. He admitted that he will
                            miss having the Boeing-707 to travel around in. The Ambassador pointed
                            out the trip to Japan is an easy 14-day voyage by water.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then reported that relations between Japan and Korea are

                            criticized for this move. The Ambassador does not, however, consider the
                            criticism serious. He expects <persName corresp="#p_KZ1"
                                >Kosaka</persName> to be a better Foreign Minister than <persName

                        <p>In answer to the President’s question, the Ambassador said he had been in
                            Japan for four years. He has enjoyed his tour and considers the Japanese
                            great people, although they are difficult to understand, being so
                            different from us. Although the shortage of land inhibits agriculture,
                            they are industrializing well and they appreciate greatly the
                            President’s understanding of their problems.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that he had cited problems faced by the Japanese in
                            his Gettysburg College speech as far back as April 1959.<note n="5"

                        <p>Minister Mizuta opened the conversation by expressing the hope that the
                            Under Secretary would extend the same cooperation and assistance to him
                            as he had to the Minister’s predecessor, Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SE3">Eisaku Sato</persName>. The Minister said that
                            since the unfortunate June disturbances in Japan the atmosphere had
                            entirely cleared up and that shortly the Diet would be dissolved and
                            elections would take place. The Minister expected “very good results”
                            from the elections. He characterized the present <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> government as “pro-American” and
                            expressed the belief that after the elections that government can do
                            more for United States-Japanese relations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then reviewed recent developments in Japan. On the political
                            side, he said, the situation had been stabilized. On the economic side,
                            with the support and cooperation of the U.S., the situation was going
                            well and the Japanese hoped for a large growth in their economy over the
                            next few years. The Minister said that to attain this desired growth
                            Japan needs foreign capital and that during his visit to this country he
                            has been making contacts in an effort to obtain such foreign
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>With respect to trade and exchange liberalization, the Minister said that
                            the Japanese Government has prepared a program which will liberalize
                            commodity import restrictions over a period of 3 years and invisible
                            import restrictions over a period of 2 years, with the objective of at
                            least 80 percent liberalization during this period. He added that
                            discrimination against dollar goods would be entirely removed by the end
                            of this year. The Minister requested U.S. assistance in obtaining
                            removal of restrictions on Japanese imports by other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary expressed deep appreciation for the visit of the
                            Crown Prince and Princess. He said that their visit to Washington had
                            fully borne out the good reports which had been received regarding their
                            visit to the West Coast. He said that this had been one of the most
                            successful visits primarily because of the picture presented by the
                            Crown Prince and Princess who reached the hearts of the American
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that we feel that we can work very well and
                            closely with the government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH3"
                                >Ikeda</persName> since we know him well and believe that his
                            government has an appreciation of the great problems and issues of the
                            day which is very similar to ours. He <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411"
                                facs="0441"/>expressed the belief that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_IH3">Ikeda</persName> government shares our desire to
                            remain free and to develop institutions of democracy and freedom, rather
                            than to go in the other direction by imposing controls on all the
                            people. It is for these reasons that we believe that the U.S. and Japan
                            can cooperate closely together in our mutual interests. We prefer to
                            think of our relationship with Japan as based upon mutual goals and
                            attitudes rather than the fact that the Japanese Government is
                            considered to be “pro-American”.</p>
                        <p>With respect to trade liberalization, the Under Secretary welcomed the
                            steps already taken by Japan and was glad to hear of the program
                            outlined by the Minister since it would move toward the goals which we
                            think are attainable now that the Japanese economy is developing so
                            well. The Under Secretary added that, while we realize that after having
                            a regime of controls for a good many years it is impossible to get rid
                            of them all at one time, the U.S. hopes that the Japanese Government
                            would keep this matter under continuous study and review with the
                            objective of moving as rapidly as possible. While 3 years are all right,
                            the Under Secretary expressed the hope that conditions would be better
                            than expected and that it would be possible to complete this program
                            even faster than planned.</p>
                        <p>Minister Mizuta referred to the question of Japan’s raising tariffs in
                            order to speed up the liberalization of commodity imports. He said that
                            the proposed tariff increase on soyabeans and a few other commodities
                            (under Article XXVIII of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) was
                            not for the purpose of restricting trade, but rather to enable
                            liberalization of quota restrictions on those commodities. He said that
                            these were necessary to ease the adjustments within the Japanese economy
                            which would result from liberalization. He added that the Japanese
                            Government expected the volume of trade to increase as a result of these
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary recognized that, upon moving from a closed economy to
                            a free one, adjustments occurred such as price levels etc. On the other
                            hand, he said, Article XXVIII is a very powerful and dangerous
                            instrument, and it is the belief of the U.S. that it must be used with
                            great discretion and not too often; it can be used to make a tariff as
                            restrictive as a quota. He pointed out that the U.S. has been under
                            pressure on this subject and has tried to resist using Article XXVIII.
                            He explained that the sensitivity on this subject in the U.S. stems
                            primarily from the fact that we negotiated tariff concessions in order
                            to gain accession to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> for
                            Japan; Japan’s withdrawal or modification of those concessions now
                            creates uncertainty in the U.S. and raises a question as to what the
                            trade policy of Japan really is. He said that this is something which
                            Japan must decide for itself, but he emphasized that it is a delicate
                            operation and that the U.S. hopes that it will be used with
                            discretion.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0442"/>
                        <p>With respect to Japan’s trade with other countries, the Under Secretary
                            said we recognize that Japan should be treated in a non-discriminatory
                            fashion. He said that the U.S. has tried to keep its markets open and
                            pointed to the fact that Japan’s exports to the U.S. have been growing.
                            He said that the U.S. has also tried to help with the other countries
                            and has always spoken up in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>,
                            and at every opportunity has talked individually to other countries in
                            favor of non-discriminatory treatment for Japanese exports. He pointed
                            to our success with the French and with Chancellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> in obtaining some relaxation of
                            restrictions against Japanese imports. He said that we would continue
                            with these efforts since we feel strongly that this is how the problem
                            can best be handled. He added that the U.S. also believes exports must
                            be handled carefully to avoid flooding markets and expressed
                            appreciation for what the Japanese Government and business has done with
                            respect to U.S. markets and what he assumed they were also doing with
                            respect to other markets.</p>
                        <p>Minister Mizuta expressed appreciation for U.S. efforts on behalf of
                            Japan. With respect to proposed tariff increases he pointed out that in

                            With respect to soyabeans, he said that the tariff increase would of
                            course be restrictive if it were a 40 percent increase; the Japanese
                            are, in fact, asking for only a 3 percent increase.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Japan’s need for foreign capital, the Under Secretary
                            said our Embassy at Tokyo has reported that steps have been taken by the
                            Japanese Government to facilitate equity investment and to make the
                            operation of foreign businesses in Japan a little easier. He welcomed
                            these steps and expressed the hope that this tendency would continue. He
                            said there is a great interest in Japan among U.S. business firms which
                            could result in considerable investment there if they are welcomed.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary referred to the concern of American oil companies
                            which operate in Japan over the proposal which we understand is being
                            considered by the Japanese Government for bringing in as “yen oil” the
                            crude oil produced in the Persian Gulf by the Arabian Oil Company. The
                            Under Secretary said that we recognize basically that this oil should
                            and must go to Japan and be used there, and that it will increase in
                            quantity as production develops. What the American oil companies desire
                            is that the importation of this crude be handled in a way that is fair
                            and non-discriminatory to avoid undue difficulties for them. The Under
                            Secretary expressed the hope that this concern be taken into account by
                            the Japanese Government in finding a solution to this problem.</p>
                        <p>Minister Mizuta said he believed the situation was being explained to the
                            American oil companies in Japan. He emphasized that, with the prospects
                            for Japan’s future economic development, requirements for <pb n="413"
                                xml:id="pg_413" facs="0443"/>petroleum would so increase over the
                            next several years that imports from the Arabian Oil Company would not
                            result in decreased imports from the American oil companies.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary referred to the Minister’s discussion with Secretary

                            emphasized our great interest in reaching a settlement of this claim.
                            Although he recognized that negotiations prior to the forthcoming
                            Japanese elections would not be practical, he expressed the hope that
                            after the elections we can sit down and settle this claim, which is
                            about the only major remaining problem outstanding between the two
                            countries. The Under Secretary welcomed the assurances which we have
                            received on this score since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH3"

                            response to the Minister’s inquiry, the Under Secretary said he had full

                            years. However, to project future it first necessary to examine briefly
                            evolution of our post-war relations with Japan to see where they now
                            stand.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">I.</p>
                        <p>When second <persName>Eisenhower</persName> administration was
                            inaugurated in 1957, Japanese-American relations were just entering the
                            third and critical phase of our postwar relations with Japan. Policies
                            which had served well in earlier phases were not altogether adequate for
                            the new period and Japanese-American relations were not on an entirely
                            satisfactory basis. In first of these three phases, occupation period
                            (1945–1952), we had had two basic objectives: (a) to bring about
                            democratic reforms so Japan’s vigorous people would not again fall under
                            total agrarian [<hi rend="italic">totalitarian</hi>] leadership and (b)
                            to help this war devastated nation attain economic stability, an
                            essential condition precedent to social and political stability so that
                            it would not fall victim of Communist subversion.</p>
                        <p>In second phase which began in 1952 Japanese sovereignty was legally
                            restored by peace treaty. However, this restoration of sovereignty was
                            in some respects nominal because Japan was still heavily dependent on
                            United States and felt it had to do very much as we wished in both
                            domestic and foreign matters. Diplomatically, Japan was largely
                            isolated; economically it was still receiving grant aid from us and its
                            commercial trade balance was heavily adverse; in security matters it had
                            scarcely begun to share burden of its own defense. Furthermore, many
                            vestigial remnents of our occupation period had inevitably carried over
                            into this second phase.</p>
                        <p>As we entered third and critical phase of our relations with Japan four
                            years ago in which a fully sovereign Japan stood restored as one of
                            leading nations of free world, there was need to put our relations on
                            sounder basis. For certain aspects of our occupation policy in form of
                            one-sided agreements and unilateral rights and privileges had survived
                            the period of their usefulness and, despite benefits they had afforded,
                            were beginning to be too costly, politically, to maintain. Japanese had
                            a whole list of complaints and grievances stemming from occupation
                            period and were progressively beginning to chafe under what they
                            considered to be unequal or discriminatory treatment which did not take
                            into full account either Japan’s sovereign and legitimate interests or
                            its remarkable growth and recovery. After <persName corresp="#p_KN1"

                            proportions. Most Japanese appreciate that we have tried to treat them

                            Japanese Government in power and Japanese people are generally friendly
                            and, much more important, feel their own interests are being served by

                        <p>However, there is no room whatsoever for complacency on our part or to

                            In first place, Japan remains target no. 1 in all of Asia for Moscow and
                            Peking, whose supporters inside and outside Japan are working
                            ceaselessly to divide Japan and United States and to exploit to hilt
                            inevitable differences which will always occur even between close
                            friends and partners. Moreover, in Japan there is a widespread spirit of
                            latent neutralism which Socialists have recently succeeded in exploiting
                            to some extent. This latent neutralist sentiment, which is more a “mood”

                            by Japanese public, is encouraged by an intellectual community which is
                            in large part fuzzy-minded and abstractionist. Furthermore, there are
                            also certain problems which although now within manageable proportions
                            will never be totally solved because they are inherent in nature of
                            Japanese-American partnership and the somewhat differing kind of
                            interests of two countries with respect to the specific problems. It is
                            this type of problem that we must watch with utmost care and be prepared
                            to make timely and constructive modifications with respect to our
                            actions and policies before such differences become aggravated and
                            serious public friction ensues.</p>

                                        finally end up where and with whom she can earn a living. If

                                        avoid a policy of restrictionism and that we also continue

                                        daily bread. In period immediately ahead we must be

                                        open mind and flexibility in order to reach agreement with

                                        which unless handled with wisdom could be exploited to
                                        rupture Japanese-American partnership. Over long term and in

                                    relations. There has recently been substantial increase in left
                                    wing activity in Japan calling for reversion of Okinawa, and
                                    Japanese Socialists are spearheading drive by draft resolution
                                    in Diet calling for reversion. If this matter becomes inflamed,
                                    not only will Okinawa become an undependable base, but relations
                                    between Japan and America can be seriously damaged. There are
                                    eight hundred thousand Japanese inhabitants of Ryukyus, and
                                    whenever majority of them protest against actions or policies of
                                    US, ninety-three million Japanese respond in sympathy.
                                    Therefore, key to keeping Okinawa as dependable military base
                                    and avoiding having it become major issue of dispute between
                                    Japan and America is for our authorities in Ryukyus to keep
                                    Okinawans reasonably satisfied [and] have flexible outlook as
                                    political or economic problems arise. We must avoid simply

                                    now in effect. We must frankly recognize that we waited

                        <p>Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Japan is one of four major industrial complexes in world. Militarily,
                            Japanese Island complexes vitally important to maintenance our and free
                            world deterrent military strength in western Pacific and Asia. Japan is
                            making substantial contribution to Asian economic development which is
                            indispensable in blocking Communist gains, and will do more. It is, in
                            fact, at present only positive element of real economic and industrial
                            strength in free Asia. Japan’s continued alignment with free world is
                            essential. However, at present such basic alignment must in first
                            instance be maintained largely through Japan’s alignment with US. For in
                            field of military security, Japan will not in foreseeable future be
                            willing to have military ties with any country except US, and severing
                            of US-Japan security ties with ensuing military neutrality would greatly
                            increase mood of neutralism which is latent and widespread in Japan. For
                            this reason, even should we be obliged to accept less satisfactory
                            arrangements from purely military viewpoint, continuation of security
                            ties is most important as one of principal ties in Japan’s alignment
                            with US and free world.</p>
                        <p>Japan’s most vital self-interest and its strongest tie with free world is
                            trade. American market is essential and as long as Japan’s daily bread
                            depends largely on our cooperation and friendship, we do not believe
                            majority of conservative Japanese people will wish chase Communist
                            rainbow. In other words, Japan’s continuing alignment with West and free
                            world will in first instance depend to great extent on degree of
                            understanding and leadership which US exercises in dealing with our
                            overall relations with Japan, particularly trade, security arrangements
                            and other problems cited above. An essential requirement is to give
                            Japanese conviction we view Japan as equal, whom we respect and not as
                            formerly occupied country that we expect to follow along in our
                            wake.</p>
                        <p>There are at present no burning issues between Japan and America. We have
                            in Japan conservative middle-of-road people headed by staunchly
                            pro-Western government that believes Japan’s enlightened <pb n="423"
                                xml:id="pg_423" facs="0453"/>self-interest requires friendship and
                            cooperation of US, and hence Japanese cooperation with US. As contrasted
                            with some desperately difficult situations in other parts of world where
                            we often have little to work with and cannot exercise decisive influence
                            through our policies and actions as there are other major forces
                            present, in Japan we would seem to have necessary tools at our disposal
                            in terms of wise and flexible policies. Therefore, in absence of
                            unpredictable international developments or serious economic depression
                            affecting Japan the key to maintaining Japanese-American partnership in
                            coming troubled period would seem in final analysis to depend largely on
                            statesmanship we exercise in future in meeting Japanese-American
                            problems.</p>

                            however, that he was proceeding in the meantime with the reduction of
                            60,000 as proposed by the Koreans on November 5, 1957, i.e. a reduction
                            from the authorized strength of 720,000 to 660,000 but an actual
                            reduction of only about 17,000. A further reduction by 40,000 to the
                            620,000 level continues, therefore, to be the subject of further
                            negotiation.</p>

                                necessitate repositioning of several units and would require an

                                Foreign Minister and <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> were
                                present. U.S. representatives told President that before

                                Washington they wished to make certain that he was fully aware of

                                that he understood effect on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                economy of maintaining 18 divisions with reduced aid. U.S. offers
                                were reviewed in detail and he was asked to reconsider <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position. President stated that
                                when he was informed of latest proposal (December 28) he was “upset”
                                and distressed to think that of all countries in the world the U.S.
                                should choose to cut its aid to Korea. He then spent the better part
                                of an hour discussing the history of East Asia with particular
                                reference to Japan’s infamy and depredations and presented the
                                familiar argument that the U.S. should not help Japan to resume its
                                position as a powerful nation. Although given opportunities to
                                discuss details of the reduction of forces problem, the President
                                made no specific reference to the <gloss target="#t_MND1"
                                    >MND</gloss>’s memorandum except to say he had seen it and did
                                not agree with it. Meaning of this statement was not clear to U.S.
                                representatives who queried <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>
                                following meeting with President. <gloss target="#t_MND1"
                                    >MND</gloss> said this meant President did not favor any cut in
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces; but that government

                            must inform the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s not what the
                            amount of reduction must be but what troop level we will support.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that the
                            crucial question is how much money will be saved. He pointed out that,
                            although Korea needs economic aid, the level of assistance must be
                            reduced. There have been suggestions that grant assistance be further
                            curtailed and Korea be required to look to the development loan fund for
                            its assistance. Such a suggestion flies in face of the obvious inability
                            of the Korean Government to service such a loan. If adequate assistance
                            is not forthcoming, inflationary forces will tear the economy apart.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would examine
                            a draft Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>) message<note n="3"

                                January 17 in telegram 533 from Seoul, the Embassy reported that
                                Korean officials claimed that <persName>Cho</persName> confessed to
                                involvement in a Communist plot to undermine the Government of the
                                Republic of Korea and had been in direct contact with Communist

                            information indicates that the Government may be seeking to outlaw the

                        <p>The arrests appear thus far to be a retrogression to methods used by the
                            Government against the Opposition in 1949 and 1952. Charges against the
                            suspects have included the familiar paraphernalia of suspected contacts
                            with spies, communist intention of contacting Progressives, advocacy of
                            “peaceful unification”, similarity of party program to the communists,
                            and “materialism and Marxism”. The Embassy “believes the purported
                            evidence is, at best, flimsy” and reports its own sampling of Korean
                            opinion as expressing lack of belief in the charges.<note n="3"

                                assessed the arrests of <persName>Cho</persName> and his five
                                associates. (Department of State, Central Files, 795B.00/1–2158) See

                            politician and has been one of the most closely watched men in south
                            Korea for years. Hearings on a writ of habeas corpus were held on
                            January 27 and 28; release was denied by the Seoul court on January 30,
                            on the basis of evidence of communist contacts.</p>
                        <p>The Government is evidently seeking to discredit and thwart the
                            Progressive Party before the April elections and, by inference, to issue
                            warning to all members of the opposition. The arrests may likewise
                            indicate fear of <persName>Cho</persName>’s personal popularity and
                            apprehension about the possible increase in popular sentiment favorable
                            to “peaceful unification” and to the Progressive Party’s socialist
                            platform. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> press has thus far
                            discreetly questioned the arrests but has raised no outcry. Government
                            action will probably tend to drive underground sentiment favorable to
                            peaceful unification and will further disillusion popular hopes for
                            improvements on the governing of Korea by the democratic process.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> himself is likely to be kept in jail until
                            after the elections; in the long run, however, Korean imprisonment tends
                            more to abet than to dampen a political career and
                                <persName>Cho</persName> has given every indication that he has the
                            courage to withstand this form of pressure.</p>
                        <p>Should the Government, as intimated, seek during the trial to claim that
                            advocacy of peaceful unification can be traitorous, it will by inference
                            make support of both <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and U.S. policy
                            in Korea on this issue criminal and may further undermine international

                        <p>The north Korean proposal was endorsed by the Chinese Communists in an
                            official statement which also announced that they were prepared to
                            discuss with the north Koreans the withdrawal of “Chinese People’s
                            Volunteers” from north Korea. The Chinese Communist statement also
                            called on the Governments of the Unites States and of the other
                            countries participating in the United Nations forces to take measures to
                            withdraw their forces from south Korea.</p>

                            the British Chargé at Peiping on May 28, 1956. In the reply, the
                            Governments of the United Nations Command stated that they were not
                            aware of any change in the position of the Chinese Communist or north
                            Korean regimes which would render a conference fruitful. The reply
                            concluded that until the Chinese Communist-north Korean side is prepared
                            to negotiate sincerely on the basis of United Nations objectives, the
                            Governments of the United Nations Command believed that another
                            conference would only bring about a repetition of the deadlock which
                            resulted at Geneva in 1954.</p>
                        <p>The Communist proposals of February 5, 1958, do not differ in any
                            essential respect from those put forward by the Communists at Geneva in
                            1954. These proposals, in one form or another, including or excluding
                            certain previous or new points, have been repeated on several occasions
                            by the Communists in public statements, the Military Armistice
                            Commission and the United Nations. One standard feature of the Communist
                            position, however, the convocation of an international conference of the
                            governments concerned, is omitted from the proposals of February 5,
                            1958.</p>
                        <p>Both the north Korean and Chinese Communist statements claim that the
                            Communists have supported peaceful unification whereas the United States
                            and the south Korean authorities have opposed it. Attention is drawn to
                            the introduction of atomic weapons to south Korea. The United States
                            “occupation” of south Korea is cited by the north Koreans as the
                            “fundamental reason” why unification has not been achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists also attack the United States as the “aggressor”
                            in the Korean war.</p>

                                    >See <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note> subject as
                                above, was for- warded to Washington following our recent
                                discussions.</item>
                            <item>“2. Washington has now replied to the effect that your proposals
                                were given thorough and sympathetic study. As a result, some upward
                                revision of ROK force levels which can be supported by the U.S. has
                                been made, and the period during which reductions in these force
                                levels are to be accomplished has been extended.</item>
                            <item>“3. It has been determined, however, that four-service force
                                ceiling of 630,000 is the maximum that the U.S. can support after
                                the end of the current calendar year. This means that a real
                                reduction of some 59,000 military personnel on active service will
                                be the maximum required.</item>
                            <item>“4. To provide for an orderly reduction program, and to permit
                                proper planning for release of military personnel and their
                                reception into civilian life, the U.S. will extend the period in
                                which the reductions must be accomplished to 31 December 1958 from
                                the date of 30 June 1958 as proposed earlier. Beginning January 1,
                                1959, therefore, the overall authorized ceiling will be 630,000
                                rather than 720,000 as previously fixed.</item>
                            <item>“5. It is proposed that the <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>
                                portion of this new ceiling be fixed at 566, 960, with the other
                                services being continued at the strengths previously discussed. The
                                new <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> ceiling will thus make
                                possible the desired increased ceilings for the <gloss

                            <item>“6. Promptly upon agreement on the new force levels, the U.S. will
                                be prepared to transfer to <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1">ROKAF</gloss>

                                the United States has agreed to furnish. It must be emphasized,
                                however, that these items can only be made available to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces upon agreement on the

                            <item>“7. <p>In our considered judgment, the strength ceilings which the
                                    United States is able to support, and the current condition of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, make it obvious
                                    that the present <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                    establishment cannot be continued. Considering the 566, 960
                                        <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> ceiling, it appears
                                    necessary that <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> reduce to a
                                    sixteen-division force. This size army will permit development
                                    of a more adequate combat and logistic support capability for
                                    the reduced number of divisions, and hence will result in an
                                    army capable of sustained operations, even though smaller in
                                    size.</p>

                            <item>“9. It is hoped that early agreement on the program as outlined
                                above can be reached in order that the additional matériel which the
                                U.S. desires to make available can be programmed during the current

                            indicated in memorandum would cause great opposition by President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and the public. He made a strong plea that
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss> reduce to an 18-division
                            force, and that the overall authorized ceiling of 630,000 be met by
                            establishing reduced peace time tables of organization for the 18

                            Communist world and the world in general by all means at our disposal.
                            We should, however, concentrate our efforts on action through the United
                            Nations.</p>

                            peninsula in the interests of unification. He has persistently held the
                            position that, since the National Assembly in the Republic of Korea has
                            been elected under United Nations supervision, all that is necessary is
                            to add to the existing Republic of Korea National Assembly
                            representatives from north Korea in proportion to the population.)</p>
                        <p>In connection with this action, pressure will be put upon the United
                            States by the Communists and perhaps neutral nations to remove our
                            forces from the Republic of Korea. Our position should be that United
                            Nations forces should remain in the Korean peninsula until such time as
                            the peninsula has been unified in accordance with the United Nations
                            proposals and resolutions. We should emphasize in this context the
                            reasons why it is impossible to equate the presence (or withdrawal) of
                            aggressive Chinese Communist troops with that of United Nations troops.
                            There are, of course, other reasons why we must maintain our forces in
                            Korea until a satisfactory settlement is achieved. Our own security
                            interests require it and it is important that we retain operational
                            control over Republic of Korea armed forces. There is also the danger,
                            as a result of Communist capabilities and the level of south Korean
                            detection and enforcement techniques, that Communist efforts of
                            subversion would be more effective were our troops not there.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked for the
                            Department’s thinking in view of the fact that the Chinese Communists
                            were withdrawing from North Korea. He felt that the Communist position
                            in North Korea is stronger than ever because they have a better base
                            from whence to operate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1">Reinhardt</persName> stated the
                            Department’s position as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In our opinion, the United Nations forces should remain in Korea until
                            the mission of the United Nations has been accomplished by the creation
                            of a unified, independent and democratic Government of Korea. Moreover,
                            until a satisfactory settlement has been achieved in Korea, our own
                            security interests require that we maintain our forces in the Republic
                            of Korea. It is likewise important that we retain operational control of
                            the Republic of Korea armed forces so as to preclude any possibility of
                            unilateral action on the part of the Republic of Korea Government in
                            attacking North Korea. There is considerable danger, furthermore, that
                            Communist efforts at subversion of the Republic of Korea Government and
                            people would be much more effective if our troops were not present in
                            the Republic of Korea.”</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement by all the Chiefs on this statement.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that this is a
                            difficult problem, that he believed we must maintain our present
                            position until the political situation is clarified and that, while he
                            has every desire to reduce military expenditures for budgetary reasons,
                            he considered it would be very helpful if all could agree that the
                            troops should stay in Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RGF1"
                                >Reinhardt</persName> replied from the political point of view there
                            are increasing difficulties in the presentation of our position,
                            particularly because of disengagement proposals which were being so much
                            discussed at the present time.</p>
                        <p>In response to General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            query as to whether the Department will have to reappraise its political
                            thinking, in view of the fact that a stalemate exists on the military
                            front, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHJ1">Howard Parsons</persName>
                            reviewed the events since February 5 when the proposal of the North
                            Koreans was reported through the press. He pointed out that after Chou
                            En-lai had <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0474"/>endorsed the North
                            Korean position and stated that they will withdraw Chinese Communist
                            troops from North Korea, the Soviets gave their endorsement. Their
                            endorsement included a request for the denuclearization of the Korean
                            peninsula.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> asked whether Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> had not said in a
                                despatch<note n="1" xml:id="d216fn1">Not found in Department of
                                State files.</note> from Tokyo that the Japanese are in favor of
                            this denuclearization proposal. Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> added
                            that he understood the proposal was similar to the Rapacki Plan<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">During a U.N. General Assembly debate on
                                disarmament on October 2, 1957, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki
                                announced that, after consultation with other Warsaw Pact members,
                                Poland was willing to accept prohibition of production and
                                stockpiling of nuclear weapons on its territory, provided that West
                                and East Germany simultaneously took the same action. (U.N. doc.
                                A/PV. 697)</note> and that Japan, Korea, and Taiwan would be
                            included in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHJ1">Howard
                                Parsons</persName> stated that this proposal will undoubtedly be
                            discussed in the Japanese Diet. He explained that at first the Japanese
                            thought Chinese Communist troop withdrawal might ease tension in the
                            area. However, they were disturbed about the belligerent tone of the
                            announcement with respect to both the United States and Japan. Since
                            then the Japanese Foreign Office has been anxious to learn of our
                            assessment of the reasons for the Chinese Communist announcement and
                            particularly whether we intend to withdraw our troops from Korea. If so,
                            the Foreign Office would be most distressed. Mr.
                                <persName>Parsons</persName> characterized this “as a most
                            encouraging development”.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> affirmed that there
                            is no reason to reappraise the military planning for Korea. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> stated that the burden
                            is on the State Department to find a way out of the political
                            dilemma.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> mentioned the fact that the Chinese
                            Communist troops were apparently having difficulties with the local
                            population (marriages, food) which may have been one reason why it was
                            decided to effect the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked what is
                            being done about the airplane which the North Koreans had just
                                kidnapped.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">On February 16 Korea National

                            list of passengers and the manifest and had stated that it was a matter
                            for the two governments of North Korea and South Korea to discuss.<note

                                to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on February 23, and on February 26

                            the protest was passed along to the North Korean Government by the
                            Soviets four or five days ago. The Department has considered publicizing
                            the protest lodged through the Soviets but has not done so because the
                            action of the Kremlin transmitting the protest to the North Korean
                            Government implied that it was interested in accomplishing the release
                            of the passengers. On March 3, however, unless favorable action has
                            occurred, the Department will release the statement.<note n="6"

                            In the State Department there is strong feeling that a firm record
                            should be made in the Military Armistice Commission, that another
                            meeting should be called, and that a recital of the history of the case
                            at that time would show the complicity of the North Koreans. The
                            Military Armistice Commission, it is believed, is the proper place to
                            discuss this question.</p>

                            found no tendency to take any action to solve the question between the

                            strong terms as “high-jacked” had been used. These wire service reports

                            with President <persName>Rhee</persName>. Defense Minister did not
                            object, and in fact gave impression he would welcome this move.</p>
                        <p>At meeting February 24, at which General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                                >Decker</persName>, Defense Minister and General <persName

                            which he posed three questions: (1) who was responsible for US decision
                            (he implied it could not have been his good friends US military and must
                            therefore have been State Department); (2) why was decision taken; and
                            (3) what could be done to compensate for man-power cut.</p>
                        <p>My reply was, I fear, equally long monologue, but at conclusion President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> said if Defense Minister and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS8">Paik</persName> were satisfied US

                            forces warranted, he would accept reduction. It was agreed General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> and I would meet again
                            with Defense Minister later in week.</p>
                        <p>Request for agreed minute was put forward for first time at February 28
                            meeting, and I am uncertain as to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            motives. Defense Minister was emphatic in saying government agreement
                            was desired, and seemed to envisage wholly new agreement along lines of
                            1954 minute, although General <persName corresp="#p_DGH1"
                                >Decker</persName> and I pointed out that New Annex B would
                            apparently cover requirements present agreement. In any event, <gloss

                            believe we should agree to it, insofar as military support levels are
                            concerned. If 1954 minute is to be revised in its entirety, I shall have

                            Her Britannic Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires in Peking on February 7. They
                            have given careful study to these statements and to the proposals made
                            therein.</p>
                        <p>“The Governments concerned reaffirm that their aim in Korea is to see the
                            establishment of a unified, independent and democratic Korea, in
                            accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. To this end, as
                            they have often stated, they wish to see free elections held under
                            United Nations supervision for the constitution of a National Assembly.
                            They are glad to note that the North Korean and Chinese authorities also
                            favor free elections and they welcome the announcement that Chinese
                            forces are to be withdrawn from North Korea.</p>
                        <p>“There appears, however, to be some doubt as to the precise
                            interpretation to be placed on the North Korean proposals. In articles
                            published on February 11, 1958 in Pravda and Izvestia the call for the
                            withdrawal of foreign forces is merely ‘a preliminary to a peaceful
                            solution of the Korean problem by the Koreans themselves’, and this
                            appears to have been the position taken by Mr. Chou En-lai in his report
                            to the National People’s Congress on February 10.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d218fn7">According to telegram 588 to Seoul, March 5, the
                                drafting committee added the following footnote at this point: “The
                                drafting group has been unable to identify the reference articles in
                                question. Therefore, unless the texts can be made available so as to
                                ensure that the quotes are accurate, the drafting group recommends
                                that this sentence be deleted.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                795.00/3-558)</note>The North Korean Ambassador in Peking is
                            reported as having stated that the ‘purpose of supervision by a neutral
                            nations organization was to see that all political parties and public
                            figures in both North and South Korea would have freedom of action,
                            speech, publication, assembly and association’ but that ‘such
                            supervision should not intervene in the elections’. The North Korean
                            Ambassador in Moscow is reported as having made a statement to the same
                            effect. These interpretations appear to call for some clarification and
                            the Governments of the sixteen countries concerned would be glad to know
                            whether, when the North Korean authorities speak of a ‘neutral nations
                            organ’ to supervise the elections, they accept that these should be held
                            under United Nations auspices and that there should be adequate
                            supervision not only of the preliminaries but also of the elections
                            themselves. They would also be glad to know whether it is accepted that
                            representation in the new National Assembly shall be in proportion to
                            the indigenous population.</p>

                        <p>On April 9 the British Embassy in China delivered a note to the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China on behalf of the
                            governments involved in the United Nations Command in Korea. The note
                            responded to statements made in February by the Chinese and North Korean
                            Governments that Chinese forces were to be withdrawn from Korea and that
                            the two governments favored subsequent free elections in Korea. The note
                            asked for a “precise interpretation” of the North Korean proposals: “the
                            Governments of the countries concerned would be glad to know whether,
                            when the North Korean authorities speak of a ‘neutral nations
                            organization’ to supervise the elections, they accept that these should
                            be held under United Nations auspices and that there should be adequate
                            supervision not only of the preliminaries but also of the elections
                            themselves.” (For text of the note, see Department of State <hi

                        <p>On May 6, the People’s Republic of China responded with a note sent
                            through the British Embassy in Beijing. Speaking for the Government of
                            North Korea as well, the Chinese Foreign Ministry argued that the April
                            9 note received on behalf of the countries involved in the United
                            Nations Command attempted to shift the focus from the critical issue of
                            the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, as proposed in February
                            by China and North Korea. The Chinese forces were being withdrawn, and
                            the Foreign Ministry stated that prospects for free elections and the
                            peaceful reunification of Korea depended upon a similar withdrawal of
                            United Nations forces from Korea. The text of the Chinese note was
                            repeated to Seoul on May 12 in telegram 722. (Department of State,

                        <p>On May 2 National Assembly elections were held in the Republic of Korea.
                            According to an assessment of the election prepared in the Office of
                            Northeast Asian Affairs on June 4 on the basis of reports from the
                            Embassy in Seoul, 8.9 million ballots were cast in the election, and
                            90.6 percent of the total eligible electorate voted. The Liberal Party
                            increased its representation in the National Assembly from 131 to 137,
                            but the largest gains were achieved by the opposition Democratic Party,
                            which increased its representation in the Assembly from 46 to 79. The
                            number of independents in the National Assembly decreased to 17.

                                    were a nigh-point in Korean politics. The conduct of the
                                    elections was considerably better than in the past, despite the
                                    Opposition’s increased complaints, which have been designed as
                                    much for political purposes as for expression of real
                                    grievances. Two major parties, as a result of the development of
                                    a strong two-party system, dominated the elections heavily and
                                    developed strong campaigns based on major issues, in a style
                                    approaching that of the more advanced democratic countries.”

                        <p>The Chinese Communists have now replied to the note of the Sixteen

                            Communist reply ignores the clarifications requested on the question of
                            free elections in Korea. Instead, the withdrawal of United States and
                            other United Nations forces is again called for, following which the
                            Communists would propose that a conference of the Governments concerned
                            be held to carry out negotiation on the peaceful settlement of the
                            Korean question.</p>
                        <p>We believe that, despite the negative nature of the Chinese Communist
                            note on the question of free elections, the Sixteen should reply. The
                            reply, which should be made quickly, should reiterate that elections
                            under United Nations supervision and providing for representation in the
                            National Assembly proportionate to the indigenous population lie at the
                            heart of the matter. The reply should also make clear that United
                            Nations forces will not be withdrawn until unification is achieved. Such
                            a reply should improve our posture in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Subject to your approval, I shall call another meeting of the Sixteen,
                            including the Republic of Korea, (the Union of South Africa has not been

                            it will meet with London’s approval. This probably means that we should
                            not encounter serious difficulties with the other members of the

                            (See <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.) On June 13 the prosecution
                            demanded the death penalty for <persName>Cho</persName> and prison
                            sentences for the other 22 defendants. (Airgram G–97 from Seoul, June
                            19; Department of State, Central Files, 795B.00/6–1958) In telegram 799
                            to Seoul, June 20, the Department of State expressed concern that the
                            imposition of a death sentence upon <persName>Cho</persName> would
                            afford the Communists excellent propaganda material and would

                            >ibid</hi>., 795B.00/6–2358) On July 2 <persName>Cho</persName> and four
                            other defendants were found guilty of violating the National Security

                            was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment, but an appellate court changed
                            the finding on October 25, sentenced <persName>Cho</persName> to death
                            for espionage, and handed down prison terms for 19 other members of the

                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> agreed to discuss the
                            matter again with Speaker Yi, but expressed confidence that the Supreme
                            Court would reverse the decision of the appellate court. (Telegram 206
                            from Seoul, November 4; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 795B.00/11–458)
                            The Supreme Court, however, upheld the death sentence on February 27,
                            1959, and on July 31, <persName>Cho</persName> was executed. On

                            Korea opened with a discussion of the need for a review of policy,
                            particularly whether or not paragraphs 9a and 10 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/2 were accurate reflections of the

                                >Harr</persName> said in his opinion the Report did not reflect
                            certain policy developments such as the turning over to the Republic of
                            Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) of jet fighter-bombers.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked whose fault
                            it was that an agreement reached in January on the strength of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces had not yet been
                            finalized in June. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            (Defense) pointed out that the reduction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> armed forces was already under way and they would soon
                            be at the maximum agreed strength of 630,000 men. In reply to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s repeated request as
                            to where the fault lay for the delay in formalizing the US-<gloss

                            the Koreans’ and partially interdepartmental. He said the State
                            Department and Defense were continuing to work on a formal US paper that

                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said the important thing to
                            bear in mind was that a reduction in forces by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is already well along.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Parsons</persName> said the Korean Government was aware
                            that the absolute ceiling for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            armed forces was 630,000 men and future discussions relating to
                            reductions would be based on this figure. An important element was the
                            modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces and the
                            introduction of missiles.</p>
                        <p>“The Korean desire for a Status of Forces Agreement was discussed. There
                            was agreement in the Board that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            should not be given criminal jurisdiction over U.S. troops. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> suggested that the
                            term ‘Status of Forces Agreement’ not be used, as this term generally is
                            accepted to include some form of criminal jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> termed the
                            differing views between State and Defense on the responsibility for the
                            administration of U.S. economic aid programs in Korea as ‘this running
                            sore.’ Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said a
                            compromise would result in a situation which would not improve the
                            present one. The President would probably have to resolve the matter.
                            The crucial question appeared to be whether U.S. operations in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> were on a peace or a war
                            footing, and whether the Ambassador or the commanding officer of the
                            armed forces in Korea should exercise the ultimate responsibility.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> promised he would
                            be severely critical with regard to this problem and to the delay in
                            finalizing the reduction in forces agreement when the Korean paper came
                            before the Planning Board. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said he understood Mr. <persName

                            forward a recommendation that U.S. operations in Korea be ‘normalized’
                            and the Ambassador invested with the overall responsibility.</p>

                        <p>On June 19, 1958, at 1000 hours Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> and the reporting officer called upon Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName>. The
                            interview was arranged at the request of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador opened the conversation by stating that the views he would
                            express should be considered as personal opinions and not official
                            United States Government policy. He further emphasized that <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"/>he had no intention of interfering in
                            the domestic affairs of the Republic of Korea; he was interested as
                            those affairs affected the international situation.</p>
                        <p>Speaking upon the subject of unification of Korea, the Ambassador stated
                            that the prospects seemed somewhat more encouraging at this time than at
                            any other time during his tenure here. He pointed out that the Soviet
                            Union was the key figure in the resolution of this problem and opined
                            that the short-term policy of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            was undoubtedly to eliminate the “atomic bases” which the United States
                            has established in the various parts of the world. He believed that the
                            introduction of more modern weapons into Korea had given the Soviet
                            Union cause to consider the value of maintaining a divided Korea. It was
                            the Ambassador’s view that the withdrawal of Chinese Communist troops
                            had been initiated in the hope of obtaining <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> withdrawal from the Republic of Korea by propaganda
                            moves; when these failed the Soviet Union would then have to consider
                            if, and on what basis, it would agree to unification. He stated that
                            this might become a much larger issue in the United Nations General
                            Assembly this fall than in recent years. The Ambassador also expressed
                            the opinion that with the withdrawal of Chinese Communist troops the
                            quiescence which has existed among the people of North Korea might
                            disappear and there might very well be more active opposition to the
                            Communist regime in the North; that perhaps we should increase our
                            propaganda efforts with this in mind. Given this situation, in which
                            unification of Korea is coming to the forefront of the world scene, the
                            Ambassador pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> must
                            put its best foot forward as a model democratic state. For these reasons
                            he wished to speak to the Vice President on matters of domestic politics
                            in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President apparently accepted as valid the speculations of the
                            Ambassador and asked whether the Ambassador felt Communist China might
                            agree to the above mentioned unification scheme or would put a price on
                            its acquiescence such as entry into the United Nations. The Ambassador
                            stated his belief that the Communist Chinese would have to follow the
                            Soviet Union’s policy in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the domestic scene, the Ambassador praised the actions and
                            attitudes of the Democratic Party during the past year pointing out that
                            in a democratic country it was desirable to have a vocal yet loyal
                            opposition party. He stated that in his opinion conditions in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had improved in the past year or so,
                            the economic stabilization program had been effective, and, while there
                            was still much to be done, real progress had been made. Moving to the
                            recent National Assembly elections, the Ambassador stated that he felt
                            they were much more free of irregularities, although some irregularities
                            still took place, than in any previous election. The Vice President
                            interrupted to disagree, stating that it was the worst election the
                            Republic of Korea had ever experienced <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466"
                                facs="0496"/>pointing to the number of suits which had been filed
                            charging election irregularities numbering over 100 and indicated that
                            this was only a partial coverage of the subject. The Vice President
                            continued, pointing out that the Liberal Party made full and effective
                            use of business and financial institutions by either borrowing or
                            levying requests for funds for Liberal Party use and had virtually
                            bought the elections inasmuch as the Democratic Party had no access to
                            such funds.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador agreed that some of the claims made by the Vice President
                            were valid but that only in a few places had the election irregularities
                            affected the results. He added that the number of election suits might
                            also be said to be evidence of an aroused political consciousness; in
                            other words, irregularities which had gone unchallenged in past years
                            were now being brought up. The Vice President agreed that this was true
                            to some extent.</p>
                        <p>Turning from this subject, the Ambassador pointed out he agreed with the
                            Vice President that the Democratic Party should place upon the record
                            their opinions of these election irregularities, but after making the
                            record the party should turn to a serious and sober consideration of the
                            matters which should be accomplished for the benefit of the people. In
                            this respect, the Ambassador pointed out, it might be necessary at times
                            for the Democratic Party to join with the Liberal Party in passing
                            certain measures sponsored by the Administration which would be for the
                            common good, for example, the bill to raise salaries of civil service
                            and military personnel. The Vice President agreed that this was a good
                            idea and pointed out the Democratic Party questioned only how the money
                            was to be raised in order to make this increase possible. The Ambassador
                            then said that he hoped the Democratic Party would also take the
                            initiative in introducing legislation for the public weal, citing as a
                            possible example a Conflict of Interest Law, explaining the initiation
                            of such a law might go a long way toward eliminating the corruption now
                            existing in government. The Vice President agreed that this was an
                            excellent suggestion and stated the Democratic Party Assembly would
                            readily support such a move because they had nothing to lose.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion of the general situation, the Vice
                            President requested a private conference with the Ambassador and the
                            reporting officer withdrew. However, at the end of the conference the
                            Ambassador informed the reporting officer that Dr.
                                <persName>Chang</persName>’s concern had been with his personal
                            safety. The Vice President made the point that continual efforts were
                            being made and plans being laid to eliminate him in anticipation of the
                            death of President <persName>Rhee</persName>. The Vice President pointed
                            out that on three fronts continuous persecution and investigations were
                            being conducted by Administration authorities; that Monsignor Carroll
                            and the National Catholic Welfare Council, the Catholic newspaper, <hi
                                rend="italic">Kyonghyang Sinmun</hi>, the Catholic Church in
                            general, and <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0497"/>specifically
                            Bishop Ro were being harassed because of their alleged support of the
                            Vice President. In addition, the Vice President stated that hope had not
                            been abandoned for passage of a constitutional amendment, as had been
                            the intent of the Liberal Party before the last National Assembly
                            elections. Lastly, he stated that plans were being made to eliminate him
                            physically. He had been informed that certain individuals had been
                            instructed to make plans for his assassination, rigging the plot to
                            attribute the crime to Communist agents who were being sent from North
                            Korea for the purpose of eliminating the leading officials of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. The Vice President said he
                            was uncertain what action should be taken and asked the advice of the
                            Ambassador stating that he was afraid of doing the wrong thing. The
                            Ambassador promised to discuss this matter with him again after giving
                            the matter serious consideration.</p>

                        <p>On July 2 the British Chargé d’Affaires in Peking conveyed a note to the
                            Chinese Foreign Ministry on behalf of the countries involved in the
                            United Nations Command in Korea. The British note responded to the
                            Chinese note of May 6 (see <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>). The
                            British note indicated that the governments for which Britain spoke
                            regretted the Chinese insistence on the complete withdrawal of all
                            foreign troops from Korea as a precondition for free elections and
                            reunification of Korea. The governments of the United Nations Command
                            did not believe that withdrawal of United Nations forces without prior
                            provision for a peaceful settlement would lead to a reduction of tension
                            in the Far East. Rather, they felt that “such action would remove one
                            necessary guarantee which exists against further aggression in Korea
                            pending a final settlement.” The note pressed again for a clarification
                            of the principles on which elections in Korea could be held and a
                            political settlement achieved which would permit the withdrawal of
                            United Nations forces. (For text, see Department of State <hi

                        <p>With respect to paragraph 9a, we believe that the policy guidance of

                            there has been no improvement in the prospects for a political
                            settlement in Korea and the Communists have not changed their position
                            regarding a settlement. The Communists have mounted an intensive
                            propaganda campaign, following the announcement of February 19, 1958
                            that Chinese Communist troops would be withdrawn from north Korea, to
                            force the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            particularly of U.S. troops from south Korea. The withdrawal of Chinese
                            Communist troops from north Korea, however, has not altered the
                            military-strategic situation in the Korean peninsula. The Communist
                            threat remains, involving the capability of launching another attack
                            against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Therefore, at least
                            until the Armistice Agreement is replaced by a political settlement, the
                            U.S. must retain its forces in Korea. To withdraw our forces in advance
                            of a political settlement would remove whatever bargaining power we have
                            for bringing the Communist side to agree to an acceptable political
                            settlement. Moreover, recalling the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 1949
                            and the resultant Communist invasion, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> would consider the withdrawal of U.S. forces to
                            constitute an abandonment of Korea to its fate. Although it is
                            impossible to predict the precise actions the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> would take under these circumstances, a situation would
                            be created in which it undoubtedly would be impossible to attain U.S.
                            policy objectives in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Other
                            Asian countries likewise would be gravely concerned with such an
                            apparent abandonment of Korea. Furthermore, in such an <pb n="473"
                                xml:id="pg_473" facs="0503"/>eventuality, we cannot be sure that the
                            Communists would not attempt to again exploit the situation through
                            force.</p>
                        <p>It is also our opinion that we cannot now afford a further reduction in
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces beyond that
                            recently negotiated with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, partly
                            for reasons mentioned above. Lengthy negotiations were held with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, pursuant to paragraph 10 of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/2, which were completed
                            only when the U.S., with the President’s approval, modified its
                            objective from a reduction of four <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions to two divisions and extended the period during which the U.S.
                            would assist in supporting the new force level from <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 to <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                            1959. Despite the fact that the U.S. agreed by way of a quid pro quo to
                            convert one of the existing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air
                            Force wings to jets and to furnish improved transportation and
                            communications equipment to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            armed forces, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> finally agreed to
                            a reduction on this basis reluctantly, with a new ceiling in its armed
                            forces of 630,000 as compared with the previous ceiling of 720,000.</p>
                        <p>Although recognizing that the military assessment as to whether the
                            military-strategic situation will permit further reductions (we assume
                            Defense and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will provide this
                            assessment) is an important factor in any consideration of further
                            reductions, we believe that the political factors which must be taken
                            into account are at least of equal importance. The Koreans have made it
                            quite clear that they will strenuously resist any further reduction
                            proposals on our part. Should we propose negotiations for further
                            reductions in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces in the
                            near future, the repercussions to be anticipated would be of such a
                            serious nature from a political viewpoint as to impair the prospects for
                            the attainment of U.S. policy objectives in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>. We can expect the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> relations would become strained and that problems in
                                U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> cooperative efforts would
                            result, not only in the military field but also in the political and
                            economic areas. Moreover, if we were to force the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to accept further reductions, the least
                            we could anticipate the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to insist on
                            as a quid pro quo would be the provision to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> of atomic-capable weapons and other types of modern
                            equipment. We obviously could not accept such a quid pro quo.</p>
                        <p>From an economic viewpoint, a cut in the size of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> military forces would not necessarily decrease the
                            amount of outside resources which would be required by the Korean
                            economy to support, while maintaining political stability, the kind of
                            military establishment that would then be necessary. The reduction in
                            the Korean force levels which is already underway is expected to do no
                            more than offset the rising trend in the cost of maintaining the
                            substantial military establishment which will remain. Furthermore, an
                            attempt to force a reduction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            force level by cutting aid could prove self-defeating since, given the
                            strong feelings held by President <persName>Rhee</persName>, it is not
                            at all impossible that, <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>despite
                            a reduction in aid, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would insist
                            on maintaining force levels through deficit financing, thereby inviting
                            an inflation which could be disastrous to the country and to the
                            continued success of our own aid programs.</p>

                            stage of world affairs was out of question. He said he had hoped to
                            announce retirement 20th and 22nd divisions Aug. 25, but this will now
                            be impossible.</p>
                        <p><persName>Kim</persName> added it was unfortunate that long delay in U.S.
                            study of revision Annex B of Agreed Minute had resulted in failure

                            crisis. I said I thought there had been equal delays on <gloss

                            attitude at beginning, we should have completed agreement last year. I
                            must admit, however, there is some validity to his argument, as delay
                            since he obtained President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s approval in
                            principle last February (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> 977867)<note

                            believe he could get away with further stalling.</p>
                        <p>In circumstances, I believe we must give Defense Minister some additional
                            time to resolve issue with President <persName>Rhee</persName>; if delay
                            not too long, reduction can still be accomplished by December 31. I
                            would not, however, recommend extension of time for reduction beyond
                            that date, and intend discuss matter with General <persName

                            These paragraphs are being revised since the original policy guidance

                            Appendix B of the Agreed Minute of Understanding of 1954, which sets

                                xml:id="d236fn4">Not printed.</note> After explaining the proposed
                            revision of paragraphs 9 and 10–a, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> said, with reference to the language “following
                            formalization of the agreement to reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces” in paragraph 10–a, that negotiations for a
                            formal agreement between the United States and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had struck a snag. The Korean Marines
                            were objecting to reductions in Marine forces, even though such
                            reductions had been approved at higher <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> levels. As a result/there is no formal agreement, an
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> counter-offer will not be
                            received until September, and aircraft are piling up because they can’t
                            be delivered to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> under present
                            policy in the absence of a formal agreement. The policy issue,
                            therefore, was whether to deliver equipment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in hope that reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be effected/or hold off
                            deliveries and press for a formal agreement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said we had a
                            human problem in Korea–i.e., <persName>Rhee</persName>–who is failing
                            fast but still controls <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense.
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> says he won’t agree to our proposals.
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and the United States are within 5,000 men
                            of agreement on total personnel strength, but <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            does not want a regrouping in a smaller number of divisions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he did not
                            want the Council to form the impression that little or no progress had
                            been achieved in reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military was
                            cooperating, and much progress had actually been achieved in reducing
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces from a nominal 720,000
                            (actual 690,000) down to 630,000. He thought it would be wise to proceed
                            on the assumption of good-faith performance by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>’ suggestion would involve some
                            revision of the proposed paragraph 10–a. He then explained the split in
                            paragraph 10–b,<note n="5" xml:id="d236fn5">The “spilt” in view among

                                thereto.</note> and asked for a decision on both subparagraphs (10–a
                            and 10–b).</p>
                        <p>The President said he assumed we would support only the number of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> personnel we had specified as adequate.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retains personnel in excess
                            of our figure, it will have to find the money to support such personnel
                            elsewhere than in the United States. With reference to paragraph 10–b,
                            the President thought the Budget-Treasury proposal, “beginning in <gloss
                                target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1960”, should not be adopted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> suggested
                            substituting “as soon as practicable” for the Planning Board language as
                            well as for the Budget–Treasury language in paragraph 10–b.</p>
                        <p>The Director, Bureau of the Budget, asked leave to explain the Budget
                            position. He felt <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should be
                            reduced even though <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0512"/>there was
                            no formal agreement, and that there should be further reductions
                            beginning in 1960. The following were among the factors not covered in
                            the Planning Board paper: (1) Why <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces could not be reduced as U.S. forces were being reduced in the
                            light of modern weapons; (2) why <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces were one-fourth the size of U.S. forces; (3) what account was
                            being taken of the reduction of Chinese Communist forces in North Korea;
                            and (4) what consideration had been given to the statement in the
                            limited war study<note n="6" xml:id="d236fn6">Not further
                                identified.</note> that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
                            would not be useful outside Korea. However, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s suggestion (“as soon as
                            practicable”) was acceptable for paragraph 10–b.</p>
                        <p>The President said that some of those at the meeting apparently did not
                            know <persName>Rhee</persName>. Difficulties had been experienced for
                            many years with <persName>Rhee</persName>, who was so emotional he had
                            once proposed sending <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces up to
                            the Yalu River. The situation became worse as <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            became senile. But we must persuade him or lose prestige. We had fought
                            a war with heavy casualties to keep Korea free; and we would not serve
                            U.S. interests by sticking rigidly to our pre-determined targets in
                            negotiations with <persName>Rhee</persName>.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff had agreed with the proposed revision of paragraphs 9
                            and 10 as written by the majority of the Planning Board, and would agree
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s suggestion
                            on paragraph 10–b.</p>

                                peaceful means, if possible to do so without compromising U.S.
                                obligations, principles, or military security.</p>
                            <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0516"/>
                            <p rend="center">Major Policy Guidance</p>
                            <p>4. There is little prospect of Communist agreement on any reasonable
                                formula for establishment of a unified democratic Korean state; but
                                short of unification on terms of a character which the United States
                                has advocated, there can be no settlement of the tensions in the
                                Korean area.</p>
                            <p>5. U.S. interests are deeply involved in Korea. Unless the United
                                States continues to provide strong political, military and economic
                                support to the Republic of Korea, the Communist bloc probably will
                                ultimately succeed in extending its control over the whole of Korea.
                                Such a development would undermine Free World security in the
                                Northeast Asia area, and (because of the symbolic importance of
                                Korea with respect to alliances and collective security) would be
                                seriously detrimental to U.S. policy of supporting peace and justice
                                through the United Nations and to the general struggle against
                                Communism throughout the Far East.</p>
                            <p>6. In the light of the above, U.S. objectives should also take into
                                account the importance of reducing Korean dependence on U.S.
                                assistance and making greater progress toward the ultimate goal of a
                                self-supporting economy.</p>
                            <p>7. The United Nations’ role with respect to Korea is an asset in the
                                struggle against Communism. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                provided the principal legal basis for successful resistance against

                        <p>Finance Minister, as spokesman for group, said <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> firmly committed to stabilization program, and he
                            could assure US revised 58 and proposed 59 budgets definitely would be
                            balanced. To this end, Government planned reduce civil service rolls by
                            15,000 (present total about 240,000 including teachers whose numbers not
                            to be reduced); endeavor amend financial act to permit fixing utilities
                            rates by Government Commission rather than by National Assembly as at
                            present; make strong effort to “rationalize” government-owned
                            enterprises, thus eliminating subsidies for these operations; and
                            intensify program for sale vested properties. Construction Minister
                            asserted definite planning under way for improved utilization Korea’s
                            own resources, including development of exports. <gloss

                            metric tons rice this year, and details are now being worked out.</p>
                        <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>As regards pay raise, all Ministers united in insisting this move
                            essential. Acknowledging corruption in government, they argued living
                            wage for government employees first step in program to correct
                            situation. They promised Liberal Party would introduce in National
                            Assembly anti-corruption law providing severe penalties for
                            violations.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will also shortly initiate
                            anti-smuggling and anti-black market drive, with three weeks public
                            education campaign to be followed by confiscation smuggled goods as well
                            as military supplies illegally diverted to black market. Ministers
                            asserted that it was now necessary to re-establish code of public ethics
                            which had disintegrated in post-war years, and also insisted that as
                            practical matter improved revenue collections, together with savings
                            from stoppage illegal use official funds and supplies, would go far
                            towards meeting cost of pay raise.</p>
                        <p>While it is obvious that continued success of stabilization program will
                            depend upon <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> performance in
                            carrying out stated objectives, we believe meetings have served to
                            impress upon Ministers difficulties which they face, and will result in
                            strenuous efforts their part to maintain stabilization. Revised 58
                            budget as passed by Assembly, and preliminary draft 59 budget now under
                            study by Embassy–<gloss target="#t_OEC1">OEC</gloss> (military budget by

                            substantial contributions to solution of problem. We urged strong
                            support of them, and will endeavor to follow up.<note n="2"

                                with a copy of the draft message. Neither is printed.</note> drafted
                            by Defense which would have informed the Ambassador and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> that additional jets for the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force would be delivered in
                            accordance with plans and not delayed, as the Ambassador and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> had requested, pending
                            reconciliation of the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> texts
                            of the revised Appendix B. The Department of Defense has now informed us
                            that it prefers not to transmit this message at this time. Instead,
                            Defense now proposes that our reply to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> counterproposal on the revised Appendix B (the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-proposed text) be expedited. When that
                            reply, which as yet has not been submitted to us, is transmitted, the
                            Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> would be
                            queried as to when they estimate agreement on the text of the revised
                            Appendix B would be reached. Depending on their estimate, the decision
                            would be made regarding the timing of the delivery of the jets.</p>
                        <p>Defense considers the President’s authorization to deliver the jets prior
                            to the signing of the revised Appendix B to be permissive and not
                            mandatory and that its proposal, therefore, is not inconsistent with the
                                <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0528"/>President’s authorization.
                            Defense also considers its proposal to be consistent with recent <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy guidance. Since responsibility
                            for delivery of the jets rests solely with Defense, we do not believe we
                            should object to the revised proposal submitted by Defense.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Communist note replies to the July 2, 1958 communication on
                            behalf of both the Chinese Communists and the north Koreans. It states
                            that the “Chinese People’s Volunteers” have completed their withdrawal
                            from Korea and that should <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command

                            Korean question would “undoubtedly improve greatly”. It alleges that the
                            introduction of new-type weapons into Korea and the establishment of a
                            guided missile base in south Korea are proof as to who is carrying out
                            aggression in Korea and who is working for a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>On the question of elections, the note reaffirms the Communist position
                            that, following the withdrawal of all foreign forces, all-Korea free
                            elections should be held and that they can be conducted under the
                            supervision of a neutral-nations organization; specific questions
                            concerning the elections can be resolved through further consultations
                            following the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command
                            forces from Korea. In rejecting the “unilateral terms” of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for a settlement, the note states that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, under the domination of the
                            United States, has been reduced to a belligerent in the Korean war and
                            has lost all competence and moral authority to deal fairly and
                            reasonably with the Korean question. The note concludes that the
                            continued presence of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command forces
                            in Korea is at present the main obstacle to a peaceful settlement and
                            expresses the hope the Governments of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            to Embassy London, commented that the note presented no new points and
                            could probably be either ignored or merely acknowledged without

                                State Council adopted and then submitted to the National Assembly a
                                revision of the National Security Law that differed substantially
                                from the act which was adopted in 1948. The proposed 42-article act
                                was much more detailed and extensive than the existing legislation
                                and placed increased emphasis upon espionage activity and the
                                curtailment of the civil and judicial rights enjoyed by suspects.

                        <p>As the 1960 presidential elections approach, apprehension among
                            Democratic Party leaders has increased that the Administration is <pb
                                n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0540"/>determined to retain power by
                            every available means, including repressive and illegal measures. The
                            views expressed in the two memoranda of conversation enclosed<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d250fn1">Memoranda of October 1 and 24 conversations between
                                Embassy officials and members of the Democratic Party concerning the
                                Yongil “B” by-election and political prospects in Korea were
                                attached. The Assembly election held in the Yongil “B” district on
                                September 19 was viewed by the Democratic Party as a probable
                                prototype of future efforts by the Liberal Party to disrupt
                                opposition politics and control the 1960 Presidential election. See

                            Democratic Party thinking and feelings in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Professing an ability to discern a strong current of popular sentiment
                            running against the Liberal Party and the present Administration,
                            Democratic Party leaders are confident they can win the 1960
                            presidential contest, if the elections are completely free. Recent
                            developments–including the Yongil “B” incident, the government’s
                            proposals to amend the National Security Law, and the likelihood that
                            the Administration will by-pass the scheduled upper house
                            elections–coupled with the previous campaign experiences of the
                            Democrats, however, have persuaded party leaders that the government
                            probably will not permit a free election. This forecast of the
                            government’s intentions also rests upon an assessment of the personality
                            of President <persName>Rhee</persName> and of the influence which his
                            personality exerts over government officials and Liberal Party members
                            at all ranks and levels of responsibility. Moreover, with memories of
                            the political crises of 1952 and 1954 still vivid, the Democrats also
                            argue that even the possibility of a politico-military coup cannot be
                            excluded.</p>
                        <p>The Democrats, however, appear to look chiefly to the United States to
                            take action to prevent their worst fears from being realized, although
                            several recent international developments appear to have raised some
                            doubt in the minds of certain party leaders that the United States is
                            prepared to intervene on the side of democratic government in Korea. At
                            the same time, Democratic Party leaders appear to have given little
                            thought to action which they might take, individually or as a party, to
                            meet a situation which they insist imperils the future of democracy in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Despite the reservations which must be made in evaluating the Democratic
                            assessment of the political situation in Korea and the prospects for
                            1960, their attitude seems to indicate a genuine fear that the present
                            Administration is determined to prevent the transfer of political power
                            to the Democrats through constitutional processes. Should the 1960
                            elections be dominated by governmental pressures and intimidation
                            designed to deny the Opposition an opportunity to win majority support,
                            it seems likely that this fear will harden into conviction. <pb n="511"
                                xml:id="pg_511" facs="0541"/>Whether, following such a defeat, the
                            opposition political forces then adopted a program of extreme harassment
                            and obstructionism or turned to even more desperate councils advocating
                            a radical change in the form of government, the result could be more
                            serious for the future of the two-party system and of democratic
                            government system in Korea than the possible disintegration of the
                            Democratic Party.</p>
                        <p>In terms of the U.S. policy objective of encouraging the long-run growth
                            of democracy and the achievement of political stability, therefore, the
                            character of the 1960 presidential elections in the Republic of Korea is
                            likely to be more important than the specific outcome of that contest.
                            For this reason, it will be in the U.S. interest to take all practical
                            measures to insure that the election will be free, to the greatest
                            extent possible, from unlawful interference.</p>

                            administration attempt amend National Security Law reaching critical
                            point. While some indications compromise may be attempted, this by no
                            means assured as indicated G–99, most objectionable element proposed
                            amendment is provision penalizing “anyone who benefited the enemy by
                            disturbing the people by reporting or spreading false facts or distorted
                            news” (Article 17, para 5). Opposition’s charge that this paragraph is
                            politically motivated is supported by Justice Minister who told Embassy
                            officer on highly confidential basis yesterday it originated with

                            consequences from international point of view of Korean action to curb
                            freedom of press. We have emphasized that one of Korea’s great assets in
                            securing free world support was its democratic development, including
                            free press, and have pointed out that if Govt sincere in argument that
                            purpose of para 5 is to prevent false attacks on political leaders as
                            well as pornographic publications, this could be adequately handled by
                            strengthening libel and obscenity laws.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this problem at length with Speaker <persName

                            bitter in comments on press and opposition. Despite my efforts persuade
                            him of importance deletion offensive press provisions I am not convinced
                            he willing make effort. Furthermore, I am not sure he can handle
                            situation as he is no longer as fully in control of <gloss

                            from less moderate elements.</p>
                        <p>In further effort smooth over bitter controversy, I also saw <gloss

                        <p>In view serious nature situation, I would hope you might call in

                            Ambassador our concern over the effects on Korea’s international

                            Law affecting freedom of the press and political activities.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> was angered at what he termed U.S.
                            intervention in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> internal affairs
                            (your comments to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                            >Yang</persName>). President <persName>Rhee</persName> accused the U.S.
                            of infringing on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> sovereignty and of
                            trying to bring about his removal from power. In this connection, he
                            criticized the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, which he claimed favored the
                            opposition Democratic Party. He likened the situation to that in Pusan
                            in 1952. Regardless of U.S. policy, the President reportedly stated, the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> intended to fight the Communists
                            and he intimated that anti-American demonstrations might result should
                            the U.S. persist in its views. He strongly criticized <pb n="516"
                                xml:id="pg_516" facs="0546"/>the Democratic Party, which he said was
                            becoming a tool of the Communists and implied, in referring to “abuse”
                            of press freedom, that opposition papers would be closed if they
                            persisted in “following the Communist line”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> has also
                            reported on a conversation he had with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
                            Home Affairs, Finance and Justice on December 8 (Tab B).<note n="3"

                                Supplement.</note> The Justice Minister claimed the U.S. failed to
                            understand the purpose of the revised National Security Law. The
                            Government, he said, had no intent to suppress press or political
                            opposition but there was a need to get at charges against the Government
                            which hurt the national interest. (A few days earlier the Minister of
                            Justice had told Embassy officers on a highly confidential basis that
                            the controversial provision of the proposed law was written by Liberal
                            Party members who had suppression of the press and of the opposition in
                            mind.) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>
                            responded by giving the substance of the telegram reporting on your
                            December 5 conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName>. The Foreign Minister then said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> had reported his
                            conversation with you and argued that there was no other way to stop
                            criticism by the press and the opposition except by the suppressive
                            provisions in the proposed law, such as Article 17 paragraph 5. He also
                            argued that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public is immature
                            and needed curbing. Koreans, he continued, were too active
                            politically.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, however, the Foreign Minister intimated that the Liberal
                            Party was considering rewording of Article 17, paragraph 5, at least,
                            and perhaps other improvements in the language of the proposed law. The
                            Embassy also reported that the Democratic Party had rejected tentative
                            Liberal Party proposals advanced informally but had left the way open
                            for further discussion. Despite President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s
                            reaction, therefore, there may be a possibility a compromise will be
                            worked out by the Liberals and Democrats.</p>
                        <p>A report on an interview with President <persName>Rhee</persName> carried
                            by CBS radio on December 11, 1958 indicated that the President had
                            justified the need for the revised National Security Law on the grounds
                            there was an invasion of Communist subversive agents and a danger of
                            war. He accused Democratic Party leader <persName corresp="#p_CPCP1">Cho
                                Pyong-ok</persName> of, in effect, playing into the hands of the
                            Communists in opposing the law. <persName>Cho</persName> is obviously in
                            trouble as a result of his strong criticism of the National Security Law
                            and his recent statement supporting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            supervised elections throughout Korea for unification. According to the
                            CBS broadcast, President <persName>Rhee</persName> clearly rejected
                            elections on any basis other than in the north alone. <pb n="517"
                                xml:id="pg_517" facs="0547"/>It is possible that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s strong feelings against <persName
                                corresp="#p_CPCP1">Cho Pyong-ok</persName> and the Democratic Party
                            will lead to actions against <persName>Cho</persName>, at least, and in
                            fact there has apparently been some talk within the Liberal Party of
                            prosecuting <persName>Cho</persName> and even seeking to have him
                            deported from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. It is quite clear
                            by now that the purpose of strengthening the National Security Law by
                            passing a revised version is to use its provisions against the press and
                            the Democratic Party.</p>
                        <p>These tactics indicate strongly the possibility of a repetition of the
                            1952 crisis, [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] At the time of the 1952 crisis, the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> constitution provided for the election
                            of the President by the National Assembly. Faced with a hostile,
                            opposition Assembly, President <persName>Rhee</persName> charged that
                            there was a subversive plot to have <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                Myon</persName> elected President, who would then form a coalition
                            government and one willing to deal with the north Korean regime to end
                            the hostilities and unify Korea. Martial law was declared, Assemblymen
                            arrested and political turmoil resulted. Despite our efforts to exert a
                            moderating influence (including, I believe, letters from President
                            Truman to President <persName>Rhee</persName> on the matter) and the
                            efforts of the Australian <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>
                            representative (who was very close to President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>), President <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            succeeded in forcing the National Assembly to amend the constitution
                            through authoritarian action so that the President would be chosen
                            through popular elections.</p>
                        <p>There is still considerable resentment among opposition and independent
                            Koreans against the U.S. for not intervening in the 1952 crisis and for
                            failing to insist on the application of constitutional and democratic
                            processes. At the time, however, the decision was made at a high level
                            within the U.S. Government not to interfere with the internal affairs of
                            the Republic of Korea. Nevertheless, President <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            felt at that time, and apparently he still does, that many officials of
                            the U.S. Government opposed him and the tactics he followed.</p>
                        <p>As a final point, we have learned on a highly classified basis that
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> has instructed that a letter be

                                270.<note n="1" xml:id="d256fn1">Telegram 270 from Seoul, December
                                22, reported that the political crisis in Korea continued into the
                                fourth day despite efforts of the leaders of both parties to reach
                                agreement. Democratic Party Assemblymen remained inside the National
                                Assembly, and the Embassy anticipated serious trouble if Liberal
                                Party Assemblymen attempted to convene the National Assembly. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.) See Supplement.</note> I continue to
                            be seriously concerned re political struggle on amendment National
                            Security Act. I am convinced that if amendment passed as drafted by
                            Liberal Party, it will set in motion series of actions resulting in
                            complete discredit <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government on
                            international scene, and which will require active opposition of US at
                            one stage or another. I have therefore recommended strongest possible
                            opposition to this attempt to muzzle press and hamstring opposition
                            party, feeling that opposition now would be preferable in terms of
                                US-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations, to later and
                            perhaps more bitter controversy, as well as more productive of
                            results.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware from reports through other channels, your
                            representations to Yang and my efforts here have had no influence on
                            “tough” elements of <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss>, and have been
                            represented by them as intervention in Korean domestic affairs–a view
                            accepted by President <persName>Rhee</persName> who apparently is angry
                            with me and the Embassy generally. On the other hand, Democratic Party
                            leaders have remarked bitterly to us that we seem to be concerned only
                            with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government’s anti-Communist
                            capabilities, regardless of how regime may conduct its domestic
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>I fear that we run grave risk of serious loss of influence here if <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government persists in enactment
                            present version of amendment and then “gets away” with it. It is for
                            this reason that I reiterate my urgent request that we somehow induce
                            stronger reaction from American press, perhaps including comments from
                            Congressional and other public figures. I apologize for being tiresome
                            about this, but I cannot escape a feeling that the issue is a vital
                            one.</p>

                            expressing grave concern with which US Government views <gloss

                            expression this concern, Department spokesman today made following
                            statement to press:</p>
                        <p>“In response to question the other day when this legislation was before
                            Korean Assembly, I remarked that this was an internal matter and so the
                            Department had no comment. However we are disappointed to note that the
                            majority Liberal Party and the opposition Democratic Party did not reach
                            a settlement of this issue in the Assembly. We hope that this
                            legislation will be implemented so as to counter the threat of Communist
                            subversion and that it will not hinder the continued development of
                            democratic institutions and processes in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>We gave serious consideration to your proposal that we stimulate press
                            reaction prior to passage of law. However it was decided not to do so
                            because we did not think it would bring about desired results and might
                            in fact involve US Government in acrimonious debate with <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government through US press which would

                        <p>“December 25</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>The recent developments in the Korean National Assembly prompt me to
                            write directly to you to express my personal concern. I understand that
                            action to revive the National Security Law was taken in order to provide
                            a more effective legal basis to deal with Communist infiltration,
                            espionage and subversion efforts in the Republic of Korea. This is an
                            objective with which we, of course, strongly agree. The manner in which
                            this law as adopted by the National Assembly, however, greatly troubles
                            me.</p>
                        <p>The Republic of Korea and you, Mr. President, enjoy the high esteem of
                            the American people. We have made common cause with you during tragic
                            times of trial and we have sought to contribute to the reconstruction
                            and development of your country ever since then. We intend to continue
                            this course to the extent we are able. It is because of our relationship
                            that it grieves and disturbs me to read the reports which have appeared
                            lately of the incidents which attended the consideration and passage of
                            this bill. Regrettably, the manner in which the law has just been
                            passed, with Democratic Party Assemblymen confined outside the Assembly
                            hall, will raise serious doubts in the minds of the allies and friends
                            of the Republic of Korea as to the merits of the law, regardless of its
                            true value or the real necessity for the law. To the extent such doubts
                            are raised we are handicapped in our efforts to muster the strong
                            support we desire for Korea in the United Nations and elsewhere. The
                            image which Korean actions create abroad necessarily affects our ability
                            in this regard.</p>
                        <p>This development is now attracting the attention of the press and public
                            of the United States. It would be my hope that in implementing <pb
                                n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0553"/>the law the Republic of Korea
                            Government will demonstrate that it will be used as it was announced it
                            was intended, to deal effectively with the Communist threat of
                            subversion and that the apprehensions that have been voiced as to the
                            prospects of the continued growth of democratic and representative
                            government in the Republic of Korea will have been without
                            foundation.</p>
                        <p>I have written you in this way, Mr. President, as a friend of Korea and
                            trust that you will receive my comments in this spirit.</p>

                                December 27, reported that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                    >Eisenhower</persName>’s message was delivered to President

                                    rend="italic">ibid</hi>.)</note> After some stalling by Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs and conversation with Vice Minister which was
                            obviously designed to learn tone of President’s message and to convey
                            hint that I should not burden President <persName>Rhee</persName> with
                            recital details of recent National Assembly action, appointment was made
                            for 10:30 this morning at Chinhae. Vice Minister accompanied me.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> received me warmly, and after reading
                            President’s message attentively, remarked that there seemed to be
                            impression Korea had violated democratic principles. “Is this correct,”
                            he asked.</p>
                        <p>I replied that it was certainly correct that both substance of National
                            Security Act amendment and manner in which it was enacted had disturbed
                            American opinion, and that President felt impelled to bring this
                            situation to President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s attention in friendly
                            manner.</p>
                        <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> then asked “what do you think I
                            should do,” but without waiting for my reply launched into 45-minute
                            version of 1952 events in Pusan, in which he demonstrated to his
                            satisfaction that 1) there had been connection between his opponents and
                            Communists and that similar connection probably existed today between
                            Communists and <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>; and 2) that foreign
                            attempts (notably <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>) to
                            intervene in Korea’s domestic affairs had been defeated, as would such
                            attempts today. He also implied that Muccio had connived against him by
                            reporting falsely to Washington, and managed adroitly to hint that he
                            had some hope I would not make same error during my tenure in Seoul. In
                            course of his summing up, he referred to reports Embassy had been
                            “negotiating” with <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>After President <persName>Rhee</persName> had finished speaking, I
                            referred again to President’s message, saying it was because he valued
                            Korea as ally that he had written. I pointed to role of public opinion
                            in formulation and execution of US foreign policy, and said US Govt felt
                            it incumbent to bring to attention its allies action which had adverse
                            reaction in US, as surely our allies would not hesitate to raise US
                            actions adversely affecting them. I went on to say that not only
                            Embassy, but I as well, had talked to <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>
                            leaders, adding that I was prepared to say publicly anything I had said
                            privately to <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>, and indeed had
                            frequently done so. I added that my reports to Washington would always
                            be consonant with my obligations to my government.</p>
                        <p>Turning to events in National Assembly on Dec 24, I said that American
                            opinion could hardly be expected to understand <gloss target="#t_LP1"
                                >LP</gloss> action in acting while <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>
                            members were confined to basement of building. President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> interrupted me, and with air of surprise
                            asked Vice Minister if it were true <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>
                            members were under confinement–Vice Minister hesitated, hedged, and
                            finally avoided direct answer despite reiterated questions from
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> and my urging. Exchange on this
                            subject ended with President <persName>Rhee</persName> charging him with
                            preparing full report on incident.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> then assured me he would look into
                            matter, “and if wrong has been done, I will correct it.” He asserted his
                            attachment to democratic principles, and conversation ended with mutual
                            assurances of need for frank discussion between friends.</p>
                        <p>My assessment of President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s position is that
                            he was sincerely convinced of need for amendment, and that it was a good
                            one, having been persuaded by <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> leaders
                            (who I believe are afraid to admit to him that party is increasingly
                            unpopular) that some connection exists between Communists and <gloss
                                target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>, whose accession to power must therefore
                            be prevented at all costs; that he had not been given full truth re Dec
                            24 National Assembly events; and that I may have planted seed of doubt
                            in his mind. Re this latter point, I am not hopeful of any useful
                            result, <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0555"/>however, as I fear
                                <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> leaders will be able to convince
                            him my report of proceedings was erroneous.<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2"
                                    ><persName>Rhee</persName> responded to
                                    <persName>Eisenhower</persName>’s letter on January 7, 1959. He
                                stated that the exclusion of the political opposition from the
                                Assembly Chamber during the adoption of the National Security Law
                                had occurred because those Assembly members excluded had attempted
                                to disrupt normal proceedings. He added that the new law would be
                                applied in such a way as to dispel concerns about the survival of
                                democracy in Korea. (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, International

                            following message: <hi rend="italic">Verbatim Text</hi>.</p>
                        <p>“Dear Doctor <persName>Rhee</persName>: Profoundly disturbed by news
                            stories in American papers reporting violent measures used by majority
                            party in Korean National Assembly to jam through legislation professedly
                            directed against Communists but which minority believes can and will be
                            used to suppress minority and the press. Hesitated to believe these
                            stories but in checking with my Government I find press reports
                            essentially accurate.</p>
                        <p>“No one recognizes more than I the constant need to study and improve
                            methods to expose and control Communist subversion. But it is hard to
                            believe that if present bill will have no other result than to combat
                            Communists more effectively, the bill would have met such opposition
                            from those minority members of National Assembly who are as strongly
                            anti-Communist as you and I.</p>
                        <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0556"/>
                        <p>“May I impose on our many years of association in fighting both Japanese
                            and Communist tyrannies to report my conviction that the undemocratic
                            measures employed in this instance may injure your position here and
                            around the world more than the new law will injure the Communists. In
                            fact such measures give the Communists just the kind of weapon they
                            desire and can use effectively against your government.</p>
                        <p>“It would be reassuring and helpful to me and my colleagues if you could
                            find some way by word or action to show that this bill will be used only
                            against proven Communists and not against loyal Koreans in opposition
                            party.</p>
                        <p>“Because I do not believe it advisable to send this message through
                            public commercial channels, I am asking Department of State to transmit
                            through its confidential means.</p>

                            had asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> to come
                            to the Department since we do not understand the treatment given <pb
                                n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0557"/>the senior United States
                            Embassy officer in Seoul on December 24, when the Korean National
                            Assembly was in session on the National Security Law. At this session
                            the press was admitted but the senior Embassy officer was not. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that it
                            is common practice around the world to invite diplomatic observers to
                            legislative sessions except secret sessions. Since the session in
                            question obviously was not a secret session, the United States
                            Government wants to protest the exclusion of the United States Embassy
                            officer. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>
                            explained that he was sure there was some misunderstanding. He added
                            that he thoroughly agreed that something was wrong in this case and that
                            he would forward the United States protest immediately.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> continued by
                            informing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> that
                            the United States Government is greatly disturbed about the manner in
                            which the National Security Law was passed. Our reports indicate that
                            all opposition was evicted and locked up. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> explained that the Democratic
                            Party National Assemblymen were sleeping in the halls to preclude any
                            action by the National Assembly. Under these circumstances something had
                            to be done, since it was impossible for the National Assembly to
                            operate. He said that following his December 5 conversation with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName><note n="1"
                                xml:id="d262fn1">See <ref target="#d253">Document 253</ref>.</note>
                            he had made clear to President <persName>Rhee</persName> that Article
                            17, Section 5, should not be used to stop freedom of speech or freedom
                            of the press. He explained that President <persName>Rhee</persName> had
                            communicated in return and agreed with the Ambassador’s position.
                            Accordingly, this particular section was amended before passage on
                            December 24.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that it would
                            appear that President <persName>Rhee</persName> has not been kept fully
                            informed on the developments in the National Assembly. He added that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> was so
                            concerned about the manner in which the National Assembly passed the
                            National Security Law that he had sent a personal letter to President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>. The conversation between Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> at the time of delivery of the letter led
                            us to the interpretation that President <persName>Rhee</persName> may
                            not have been fully informed.<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d260">Document 260</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> continued that it is
                            understandable that the Government of the Republic of Korea would want
                            to move ahead to enable the National Assembly machinery to act. However,
                            to remove all opposition bodily in order to pass the bill does violence
                            to democratic principles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> referred to the fact
                            that editorials are being written in the United States press on the
                            December 24 action in and by the National Assembly. Also, Communist
                            propaganda is exploiting this action <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528"
                                facs="0558"/>throughout the world. In addition, among Korea’s best
                            friends this action has caused deep concern regarding the future of
                            democratic and representative government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> stated that he was
                            sure President <persName>Rhee</persName> would be interested and
                            appreciate the views expressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>. He continued that the change in Article 17,
                            Section 5, would necessitate that the Government prove that there was an
                            intention to benefit the enemy. He added that the Communists have been
                            importing huge sums of money to influence legislators–mostly
                            opposition–newspapermen, etc. Although the situation in this respect is
                            very serious, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>
                            expressed his certainty that there is no intention on the part of either
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> or Mr. Yi Ki Poong of shutting out
                            the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we
                            understand the stated purpose of the Law but to pass it by eliminating
                            the opposition through eviction and incarceration did violence to all
                            democratic concepts and procedures. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> responded that the method which
                            had been used was not good. However, surely the United States does not
                            want the Republic of Korea overthrown by these people. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that, of course, we
                            do not want the Republic of Korea overthrown by its enemies. However,
                            the type of action which was taken on December 24 is the kind that can
                            lead to the eventual overthrow of the Republic of Korea by giving
                            ammunition to the real foes of Korea. He concluded by pointing out that
                            the whole world will be watching the Korean situation closely to see how
                            the law is being enforced and to observe whether it is being used for
                            the purposes stated, namely, to fight infiltration, espionage and
                            subversion. In conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> again vigorously protested the exclusion of a
                            senior Embassy officer from the National Assembly proceedings on
                            December 24.</p>

                        <p>We estimate that 1959 will be a difficult year in terms of U.S.-<gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations and U.S. interests in the
                            Republic of Korea. The stage is being set in Korea for the 1960
                            Presidential election and the influence we may be able to exert is
                            likely to have an important effect on the future course of events there.
                            It is for this reason that I am convinced that it is highly desirable
                            for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> to return
                            to Washington for consultations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador should be able personally to give us a better assessment
                            of the situation than we can gain from telegrams and other
                            communications. He can give us the flavor that results from first hand
                            knowledge growing out of personal conversations with members of both the
                            Liberal and Democratic parties as well as government people. Knowing the
                            Korean personalities involved as well as he does, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> will be able to give us the
                            necessary additional information to enable us to build our program of
                            coping with the problem presented by the present situation in the <gloss

                        <p>Another aspect of the situation is seriously disturbing and reinforces
                            the conviction that the Ambassador should return for consultations as
                            soon as possible. As things are developing, there is a serious danger
                            that the influence of the U.S. Government in Korea may decrease as a
                            result of the National Security Law controversy. The Ambassador has
                            already pointed out this danger. We believe the problem is even more
                            serious than the Ambassador himself has intimated, however, and that his
                            own position is being threatened. The identical telegrams sent to you
                            and Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Flemming, and we suspect

                            Koreans, Ambassador Muccio’s recall and subsequent retention in
                            Washington for almost two years before being appointed Minister to
                            Iceland was a direct outgrowth of the 1952 Pusan political crisis. They
                            feel that these developments regarding Ambassador Muccio were a direct
                            result of President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s intervention. The
                            resignation of Ambassador Lacy is viewed similarly by a large number of
                            Koreans.</p>
                        <p>In view of the seriousness of the period ahead with respect to U.S.
                            interests in Korea, it is very important that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and the Korean people understand clearly
                            the full support of the Department, and the U.S. Government generally,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and Embassy
                            Seoul enjoy.</p>
                        <p>For the above reasons, the need to have the Ambassador’s personal
                            assessment of the situation and the importance of reaffirming the
                            Department’s confidence in him, I believe that for psychological and
                            political reasons that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> should return to Washington for consultations.
                            To be most effective, I believe the Ambassador should stay in Washington
                            for only a short period (perhaps a week) with due publicity given to the
                            meetings he has with high level officers of the Department, and if
                            possible with the President. It will also be important to demonstrate
                            the firmness and unanimity of U.S. policy with respect to Korea by
                            continuing to make it clear during the course of the year that the
                            Ambassador has the Department’s full support.</p>

                        <p>321. I saw President <persName>Rhee</persName> yesterday to say goodbye
                            and in response his indication few days ago that he wanted to talk with
                            me. Conversation was friendly except for one moment when I questioned
                            his assertion Democratic Party was, in effect, Communist
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName>, while declaring his attachment to
                            democratic principles, said twice during conversation that in struggle
                            against Communist infiltration and subversion, some departure from
                            democratic processes would be necessary. He assured me he welcomed my
                            comment and advice, but when I urged again that effort be made to
                            restore normal working relationship between parties, came up with
                            argument re Communist character of <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>. In
                            reply my statement to contrary, he implied that if my advice were based

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> described
                            briefly the current political situation in the Republic of Korea. He
                            indicated that members of the Liberal Party (President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s party) apparently have decided that they
                            can not stand to have another election as free and open as that in May
                            1958. These individuals are divided into two groups: (1) those who want
                            to retain their power at any cost and (2) those who are sincerely
                            convinced that the country can not be run by the opposition party. He
                            explained that the Liberal Party did well in 1957, with economic
                            stabilization, a large crop and other favorable factors. They also did
                            well in the May 1958 elections, when they succeeded in electing a clear
                            majority in the National Assembly even though the Democratic Party more
                            than doubled the number of seats it held. However, in recent weeks the
                            Liberal Party has lost heavily in terms of public opinion. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> concluded his
                            evaluation by saying that he is convinced that the United States must
                            take actions to deflect the Liberal Party from pursuing the course which
                            it started on December 24, 1958 (the date of enactment of the National
                            Security Law).</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the problem in Korea was similar to that
                            appearing throughout the world in many of the new countries, where the
                            people seem not to be ready, in terms of education particularly, to
                            operate under the very fine constitutions which had been written for the
                            countries in question. In several countries in the last few months
                            military dictators had taken over as a result of lack of popular support
                            of the government in power.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> responded that,
                            except for the Japanese, the Koreans are among the most literate of all
                            Asian peoples. In addition, democracy was working well in Korea until
                            the recent excesses. He explained further that the situation can best be
                            described as one in which the party in power wants to retain its power
                            and is willing to go to considerable <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533"
                                facs="0563"/>lengths to serve that end. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> explained that analyses of the
                            election in May showed those Assemblymen who had the reputation for
                            serving their constituents well won reelection almost without exception.
                            However, if the immoderate elements of the Liberal Party are permitted
                            to continue a course which enables them to retain their position in
                            government without regard to the type of actions which must be taken to
                            accomplish such purpose, the Korean people will become so disillusioned
                            that they will become susceptible to extreme solutions. He explained
                            that in spite of President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s assertions that
                            the Democratic Party is a communist party, in fact it is probably less
                            infiltrated than is the Liberal Party. However, President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> has obviously been convinced by
                            individuals wishing to retain power that the Democratic Party does have
                            communists in it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the opposition members in Korea were afraid
                            for their lives.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> indicated that
                            the leaders were; in fact, at one time there had been an attempt made on
                            the Vice President’s life. In addition, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPCP1"
                                >Cho Pung-ok</persName>, leader of the Democratic Party, is in a
                            position of possible danger to his life. Those members of the Democratic

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> reinforced his
                            conclusion that the Koreans were capable of operating a democracy by
                            referring to the devotion and earnestness of the Korean youth. He added,
                            however, that these are the individuals who can be most affected by a
                            continued deterioration of the democratic processes in Korea and they
                            are the group that could quickly turn to violence. The Ambassador
                            concluded by referring to his personal conviction that if we are
                            determined it is possible to deflect the Liberal Party from its present
                            course. However, we must be prepared to use all the resources at our
                            disposal if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> had a program. When answered in the affirmative,

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the
                            absence of a normal relationship among the various agencies in Korea was
                            an obstacle to efficient and effective operation of the United States
                            Government in Korea and to any effective implementation of a program to

                            is decided to take such action. He further commented that had we had a

                        <p>The results of the 1958 elections and other reports indicate a growing
                            popular dissatisfaction with and opposition to the Republic of Korea
                            Government and the dominant Liberal Party. The political opposition has
                            been growing in strength. Faced with a presidential election in 1960 the
                            Liberal Party has turned to undemocratic tactics to cope with the
                            situation and to maintain itself in power. As a result, the future
                            course of events in the Republic of Korea will have a serious impact on
                            the <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0565"/>achievement of United
                            States (and United Nations) objectives in the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Considerable progress has been achieved in the development of democratic
                            institutions and processes. This has been due in great part to the
                            moderate leadership of the Liberal Party since 1954 by Assembly Speaker
                            and Party Chairman <persName corresp="#p_YK2">Yi Ki-pung</persName>.
                            This moderate leadership sought to bring about improvements in
                            government and economic conditions which would regain popular support
                            for the Liberal Party. Despite some evidence of modest successes in this
                            regard, the moderate elements have now been pushed aside by the tough
                            faction of the Liberal Party who seem determined to retain political
                            power through any means, including undemocratic and authoritarian
                            tactics as evidenced by the recent passage of amendments to the National
                            Security Law, ostensibly directed against Communist subversion and
                            infiltration but in reality designed for use against the opposition and
                            the free press in connection with the presidential election of 1960. The
                            growing influence over party affairs by this hard faction has become
                            possible as a result of Speaker <persName corresp="#p_YK2"
                            >Yi</persName>’s declining health, which has led to his increasing
                            withdrawal from active guidance of the Party, and the electoral setback
                            suffered by the Party under moderate leadership. For the moment, at
                            least, this hard faction has President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s
                            support, and moderate elements can not be expected to oppose the Party’s
                            moves towards authoritarian rule so long as they seem to be succeeding.
                            If, however, it can be made plain that the United States will resist any
                            departure from democratic methods, then there is a reasonable hope that
                            the moderate elements will reassert themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Korean people have developed a remarkable degree of political
                            consciousness. Their experience with representative government since
                            1948 has demonstrated to them that political power can be determined by
                            the ballot (they have had six national elections). In this political
                            sophistication lies an important difference between Korea and other
                            countries, such as Pakistan or Burma. The Koreans, despite serious
                            adversities, have been developing a democratic system of government; and
                            the current crisis arises not from the failure of democracy in Korea but
                            rather from its growing success.</p>
                        <p>In this situation the mood of the Korean people is no longer such that it
                            will passively accept and submit to undemocratic and authoritarian
                            measures of political control. They now have in the freedom of the
                            press, in the Democratic Party and in the elections provided by their
                            Constitution, the channels through which they can express their views,
                            their criticism of the Government and their opposition to the Liberal
                            Party. A large segment of the Korean population looks to 1960 as an
                            opportunity to elect a government (through the presidency) more
                            responsive to the popular will. Attempts, therefore, to stifle freedom
                            of the <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0566"/>press, to curtail
                            opposition political activity, or to tamper with the Constitution, will
                            very likely lead to a strong popular reaction, including violent
                            actions, against those responsible for these measures.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Probable Tactics of the Liberal
                                Party’s Tough Faction.</hi></p>
                        <p>From my talks with President <persName>Rhee</persName>, I have concluded
                            that the tough faction of the Liberal Party has convinced him that the
                            Democratic Party is Communist-infiltrated. Although the Democratic Party
                            leaders are noted for their anti-Communist vigor, it was probably not
                            difficult to persuade President <persName>Rhee</persName> to the
                            contrary, since his is inclined to suspect any opposition to him as
                            being Communist-inspired. It must be expected, too, that the tough
                            faction can gain President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s consent to
                            suppression of the opposition. The ruthless tactics employed by them in
                            pushing through the National Security Act amendment were probably
                            intended to provoke the Democratic Party into extra parliamentary,
                            violent action, and were thus a first step in laying a basis for
                            subsequent moves against them.</p>
                        <p>My supposition is that the Liberal Party leaders propose to eliminate the
                            opposition from the National Assembly and thereafter amend the
                            Constitution to provide for indirect election of the President in 1960.
                            If this be so, then in the process they will have to curb the press,
                            which will undoubtedly go all out in their exposure of the Liberal Party
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>These tactics are roughly analogous to those employed in 1952, which
                            succeeded, due largely perhaps to preoccupation with the war, which
                            served to excuse strong measures.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. The United States Role.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the eyes of the Koreans, the United States has a definite role to play
                            in this situation. A feeling is widespread that, if the United States is
                            really concerned for the welfare of Korea, its influence should be used
                            for the promotion of the political good, as well as for the development
                            of economic and military strength. And there is no doubt in the minds of
                            the Koreans as to our power to influence the Republic of Korea
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government is faced with two alternatives: (a) a
                            passive disinterested role or (b) a positive course of action to
                            influence the situation.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that in the short run a passive United States role is
                            unlikely to have seriously adverse repercussions. President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and the hard elements of the Liberal Party
                            can probably keep the situation under control through strong police
                            methods, although popular unrest will undoubtedly increase.</p>
                        <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>However, in the longer run, a passive United States role in the face of
                            undemocratic actions by the Liberal Party would have serious
                            consequences in terms of United States interests in Korea. When
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> is no longer on the scene (he is now
                            84 years old), the Liberal Party will probably be unable for long to
                            maintain control even by the continued use of forceful measures.
                            Conditions in Korea would therefore deteriorate further, and it would
                            become more difficult to cope with them as time passes.</p>
                        <p>Some of the specific consequences of United States inaction are outlined
                            below:</p>

                                United States to support the Republic of Korea internationally and
                                specifically in the United Nations.</item>

                        <p>The problem before us is two-fold: (1) to restore normal parliamentary
                            functions and the operation of the political party system; and (2) to
                            prevent the eventual use of authoritarian actions to suppress the
                            opposition and curb the free press, which would in time lead to such
                            deterioration of the situation as to endanger the achievement of United
                            States objectives in Korea.</p>
                        <p>There are indications that the United States attitude already evinced is
                            being effective, the first move towards a compromise between the
                            Liberals and Democrats which would restore parliamentary functions
                            having been taken shortly after my recall for consultation and the
                            appearance of critical editorials in the American press. Should this
                            compromise move not succeed, or should the Liberal Party now accept a
                            compromise and subsequently embark upon repressive measures, I would
                            recommend the following course of actions, to be pursued ad seriatim.
                            Needless to say, should democratic processes be restored at any stage of
                            the suggested course, our pressures should be relaxed and positive
                            actions taken to demonstrate our satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>I have endeavored to set out below those actions which I believe would be
                            effective but which would avoid weakening the effectiveness and combat
                            readiness of the Republic of Korea armed forces. We should not, of
                            course, exclude additional actions which might subsequently appear
                            useful, the criteria for decision always being that we are prepared to
                            carry through actions which we begin, and that there be no impairment of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength.</p>

                                possible. A wide representation of the United States press, not only
                                in Seoul but throughout the provinces, should be arranged to cover
                                the 1960 electoral campaign. Even if democratic processes have been
                                restored prior to that period, the tough faction of the Liberal
                                Party will undoubtedly be tempted to revert to a hard line and
                                engage in election irregularities. The presence of American newsmen

                            displeasure, with the consequences which may flow therefrom. But to
                            adopt a passive role will mean that we must face a constantly
                            deteriorating situation leading almost certainly to civil turmoil–a
                            situation which the Communists will be quick to exploit.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if we move positively, we shall have the support, for what it

                            streak of political realism. He has, for instance, been careful not to

                                visited Korea February 6–11. In presentations made to the committee,
                                Korean officials requested defense support aid of $250 million
                                annually “for next few years,” and asked that a “stepped up effort”
                                be made to remedy the equipment deficiencies of Korean forces, while
                                implying that Korean force levels should not be further reduced.

                                development plan for Korea should be prepared and implemented, and
                                that, as the Korean armed forces were provided with modern
                                equipment, a number of active divisions could be replaced by reserve

                            great tact Draper cautioned President massive U.S. aid could not
                            continue indefinitely and first emphasis must now be placed on
                            developing export industries and export markets. He asserted prelude
                            this step must be establishment realistic exchange rate permitting
                            Korean goods and services compete in world market. While President
                            obviously did not welcome this advice, he listened attentively and
                            respectfully. Without Embassy foreknowledge General Hull then introduced
                            thesis that over two to three-year period further reduction active
                            divisions armed forces might be accomplished without sacrificing
                            military strength if number of reserve divisions increased
                            correspondingly and complete equipment therefore provided plus
                            intensified training to insure combat readiness. Minister Defense
                            frankly opposed this suggestion though perhaps in self-defense since he
                            roundly criticized by President for acquiescence last reduction two
                            active divisions. In discussion which lasted nearly hour and half
                            President agreed to consider these proposals carefully. Believed here

                            preliminary conclusions resulting from his recent trip to Japan, Korea,
                            and Taiwan.<note n="1" xml:id="d270fn1">See <ref target="#d268fn1"

                        <p>[Here follows a discussion of the visit to Japan.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. Draper said that he saw President <persName>Rhee</persName> three
                            times, once with General Hull. Both General Hull and he are convinced
                            that a reduction in the number of Korean troops is both possible and
                            desirable. He proposes that equipment from de-activated divisions be
                            used for training reserve divisions to place them on a thirty day basis.
                            Starting next year further divisions would be deactivated and equipment
                            so utilized until the total is reduced from eighteen to twelve divisions
                            or from 650,000 to 400,000, or better than 5,000 per month over a period
                            of the next three years. He added that General Hull considered that from
                            a tactical stand-point troops should be trained and equipped on a more
                            mobile basis; that therefore the present situation with fourteen
                            divisions at the front line and four in reserve would be about reversed;
                            that this would permit the bulk of the troops to be used for a mobile
                            defense with which he understands General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> agrees.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired whether the
                            basis of his recommendations to reduce the forces was to save money or
                            for better defense. Mr. Draper responded that Korean economy would be
                            strengthened and the civilian labor force increased. In rebuttal, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that there
                            wouldn’t be any economy if the communists came in. Mr. Draper said there
                            are now eighteen divisions in the Korean army plus one Marine division
                            plus two U.S. divisions, making a total of twenty-one in all <pb n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546" facs="0576"/>Under his plan one division would be
                            converted into reserve every six months beginning next year, if
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> agrees; he added this planned
                            reduction could be stopped at any time if changed circumstances so
                            dictated. Mr. Draper agreed that we must maintain a strong military
                            posture and also with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s observation that the communists are probing
                            everywhere, not only in the Far East. Mr. Draper said in political terms
                            he was thinking that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might
                            announce some reduction of its forces and ask that the communist North
                            Korea do likewise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            thought this would be inadvisable because of the adverse effect of such
                            action on other Asian countries. He added that on the basis of their
                            past record, agreements of the communists were not kept anyway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Draper then turned to the economic situation in Korea, pointing out
                            that imports were over $400 million while exports totaled only $16
                            million supplemented by offshore procurement approximating $100 million.
                            He said that an excellent recovery job had been done by <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, but that he felt more progress could
                            be made toward viability. In this connection he said that the Koreans
                            had 200 thousand tons of rice for export, but that not enough effort had
                            been made by either the Koreans or the U.S. to dispose of it, although
                            some small amount had been sold to Okinawa through military channels. He
                            mentioned that Korean fish should be sold to Japan, and that textiles
                            should be sold generally abroad but were prevented from moving primarily
                            by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> rules. He said that a rice
                            agreement with Japan was essential since Korea has an excess of high
                            grade rice and no access to the Japanese market. He said that with a
                            surplus of rice in the Far East and the failure to export, the Korean
                            farmer was hurt by lowered prices. Although admitting that it was a long
                            haul toward viability in Korea, more effort should be made and a long
                            range plan for exports is needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that as
                            long as such a high percentage of gross national product goes for
                            military costs, there is no chance for economic viability, and the main
                            economic job is to hold the line against a runaway inflation. Mr. Draper
                            then touched on the exchange rate which he said was not conducive to
                            exports. He said that the American businessmen indicated that there were
                            different rates at present of 1500 hwan per U.S. dollar for dollars,
                            1200 hwan for $1 equivalent of Japanese yen, and 900 to 1000 for other
                            currencies despite the fact that the official rate is 500 plus 150 hwan
                            tax on imports. He added that President <persName>Rhee</persName> had
                            mentioned to him that he wished Mr. Dodge could come over and spend
                            three or four months on this problem. Mr. Draper said that he recognizes
                            the great difference between Korea and Japan, where Mr. Dodge worked on
                            financial problems. He questions, however, whether Mr. Dodge’s health
                            would permit him to go to Korea, although he has passed the information
                            on to him. Mr. Draper finished Korea by <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547"

                            provide policy guidance for the period beginning July 1, 1959 on the
                            level of United States forces to be retained in Korea and on the level
                            of Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) armed forces.
                            We understand informally that Defense has not yet reached a firm
                            position on any changes it may wish to recommend regarding basic United
                            States policy toward Korea as reflected in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5817. The following are the general views we will wish
                            to express at such time as the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            undertakes its review of our basic policy on Korea: <list>

                                <item>Paragraph 2d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817
                                    defines the current United States objective of maintaining the
                                    combat readiness of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                                    forces vis-à-vis the threat of Communist aggression. The
                                    paragraph should be amended to take into account the withdrawal
                                    of Chinese Communist forces, accepted as having been completed
                                    last October. In addition, paragraph 6 of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Report on Korea indicates the
                                    possibility that the combat readiness of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                        >ROK</gloss> armed forces may not be at the level envisaged
                                    by paragraph 2d of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817. For
                                    example, paragraph 2d calls for maintaining <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces capable of assuring
                                    internal security and, together with United States forces in
                                    Korea, capable of deterring or successfully resisting aggression
                                    from the North Korean forces alone. Paragraph 6 of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Report, however, indicates that
                                    a lack of logistical backup and worn-out condition of much of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> equipment would preclude
                                    a sustained defense by those forces against an attack from north
                                    Korean forces alone without prompt additional logistical and air
                                    support. We recommend that paragraph 2d be retained in its
                                    present form (with the one change indicated to take into account
                                    the withdrawal of Chinese Communist forces) with a view to
                                    retaining the <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0581"

                                    authorized and actual ceiling of 630,000. This paragraph should
                                    be revised to reflect the successful termination of these
                                    negotiations last November. It is also recommended that this
                                    policy be updated to provide for assistance in supporting <gloss

                                    1960. The paragraph also calls for the planning during <gloss
                                        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 for gradual further
                                    reduction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army forces
                                    as soon as practical, taking into account the international and
                                    enemy situation, the effect of the initial reductions (which
                                    have already been effected), the effect on the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, the modernization of
                                    United States forces in Korea, and the over-all level of United
                                    States military assistance programs world-wide. We believe that
                                    we cannot now afford a further reduction in <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels and that any
                                    planning for further reductions must be undertaken with great
                                    care. This section of paragraph 10 should be updated to provide
                                    policy guidance through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960.
                                    We concur that military assistance should be continued to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to carry out the

                                    provides for the actions the United States should consider in

                                    renew hostilities unilaterally with the Communists. We believe

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HKGJ1">Harr</persName> then mentioned various
                            “problem areas” in Korea: The internal political situation had been
                            complicated by a resurgence of undemocratic tactics. The economic
                            situation had been marked by a decline in exports, by inflationary
                            tendencies, and by Development Loan Fund activity. Congress had been
                            requested to provide additional technical assistance funds for Korea.
                            Relations between Korea and other Free World countries, with the
                            exception of Japan, were good. However, the military capabilities of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces were at a somewhat lower
                            level than the policy prescribes (see par. 6 of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> Report). Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HKGJ1">Harr</persName> then referred briefly to cost
                            studies of alternative levels of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces now under way, to the revised US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            to the delivery to Korea of a second wing of jet aircraft, and to the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> expressed the feeling that
                            the Planning Board should address itself immediately to the problem of
                            the expiring paragraphs in the Korea policy, without awaiting the
                            full-dress review of Far East policy which it would be undertaking a
                            little later.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> requested that
                            the Planning Board in the course of its review consider paragraph 24 of
                            the existing policy, which provides for actions to be taken if <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should renew hostilities
                            unilaterally. The present paragraph 24 omits any consideration of the
                            territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> accordingly thought it would be
                            desirable to restudy the paragraph with a view to the possible inclusion
                            of a definite provision for protecting <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> territorial integrity, even if <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            outlining certain requirements under U.S. Military Government Ordinance

                            governing the regulation of political parties. Presumably, a similar
                            memorandum was also sent to the Liberal Party. According to press
                            reports available to Embassy Seoul, the memorandum detailed such
                            requirements as a report to the <gloss target="#t_OPI1">OPI</gloss> ten
                            days in advance of the intention to hold a rally or other “political
                            gathering”, a report of the “results” within five days, a report on the
                            location of all party branch offices, submission of personal histories
                            of party officers, submission of a journal of meetings and a list of
                            party members, a report on sources of income and expenditures, and
                            submission of quarterly reports on party activities and “future
                            plans”.</p>
                        <p>Embassy Seoul points out that certain of these requirements had already
                            been stipulated under the U.S. Military Government Ordinance but that,
                            according to a <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> member, the reporting
                            requirements have never been enforced and, since its inauguration, the
                                <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> has never complied with
                            regulations regarding submission of reports. The Embassy notes that the
                            requirements for advance notice and subsequent reports on party
                            meetings, and quarterly reports on party activities and future plans,
                            however, are not stipulated in the original ordinance. These additional
                                <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0585"/>requirements apparently
                            have been instituted in accordance with a section of the ordinance under
                            which the <gloss target="#t_OPI1">OPI</gloss> may issue “additional
                            regulations governing political parties”.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy comments that it is unlikely that the Government will attempt
                            to dissolve the <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> but that strict
                            enforcement of the regulations, however, could provide the Government
                            with a strong weapon for harrassing the opposition and a means to
                            intimidate persons now affiliated with or sympathetic to the <gloss
                                target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss>.</p>

                            highly likely that this latest move by the Korean Government will
                            attract widespread critical press attention and may be used in some
                            quarters to attempt to justify the allegation made in connection with
                            the December 24, 1958, incident that the Government was moving to
                            suppress the political opposition in anticipation of the 1960
                            Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections. <gloss target="#t_AP1"

                            submit reports to the Government on political activities”. Although we,
                            of course, do not know what action the Government may or may not take
                            under these regulations, we are concerned not only with the possibility
                            of critical press reaction with its attendant problems but with the fact
                            that the Korean Government has seen fit to issue this memorandum to the

                        <p>We consider that it would be highly inappropriate for us to comment

                            of the clearly domestic nature of the issue involved, we do not believe

                            from this Government<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> resigned as Assistant
                                Secretary on June 30. He was succeeded on July 1 by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PJG1">J. Graham Parsons</persName>.</note> and to
                            convey his appreciation for all that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> had done for Korea. He emphasized President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s appreciation of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s strong convictions and firm
                            stand against Communism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said that he greatly valued President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s opinion and asked Dr.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> to give the President his warm regards. If
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> were less stalwart, he said, there
                            would not be a Korea today. Korea’s cause is the cause of the free world
                            and Korea is one of the stalwart defenders of the free world. Dr.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> said he wished to assure Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that Korea would remain the
                            true and faithful ally of the United States and would stand by it in
                            time of need. Dr. <persName>Cho</persName> said that although Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> was leaving his
                            important post he was sure that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s influence would remain and that he would
                            continue to work for the free world. Korea, he said, would continue to
                            count on him as a strong friend. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> emphasized that Korea had many friends in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>While emphasizing that he had no desire to interfere in the internal
                            affairs of the Korean Government but speaking as a true friend of Korea
                            and as one who appreciates Korea’s stalwart role in the free world’s
                            fight against Communism, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said he felt compelled to say that the thing
                            that has embarrassed us most and embarrasses us today has been the
                            Korean Government’s action to close the leading opposition newspaper,
                            the “Kyonghyang Sinmun”. He said that he was working <pb n="557"
                                xml:id="pg_557" facs="0587"/>at that moment on an answer to a
                                letter<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                            from a prominent Senator who had expressed his strong concern over the
                            closure of this paper. It is difficult for us, however, to explain or
                            defend this action. In the United States freedom of the press is one of
                            the foundation stones of our democracy. He said that both Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> and Minister Han had
                            given us the Korean Government’s reasons for taking this action.
                            Nevertheless, we could not explain or defend this action since it puts
                            Korea in the position of doing the very thing which Korea is fighting
                            against. Korea has developed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said, a degree of democracy not exceeded by
                            any Asian nation. However, this action cancels out much of what Korea
                            stands for in the eyes of its friends. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said he regretted, therefore, that he could
                            neither explain nor defend this action in the letter he was presently
                            writing. He said that he had hoped that the Korean Government would have
                            taken some action to remove the basis of this criticism by this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName>Cho</persName> said he appreciated the
                            friendly advice tendered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and he was sorry to cause a friend concern. He
                            said that he feared that the Korean Government’s action in this case was
                            misunderstood. He said that while Korea had made remarkable progress in
                            democracy and while it was a great admirer of the traditions of the
                            United States, we must bear in mind that it had only had ten years of
                            democracy and those years had been interrupted by the Korean conflict.
                            The Korean Government, he said, has tried its best to preserve the
                            freedom of the press in Korea to the maximum extent possible and he
                            expressed the hope that it could perfect a completely free system in
                            time. He said that he hoped the United States would also understand the
                            security situation confronting the Korean Government and the problems
                            posed by the intensification in Communist infiltration and subversive
                            activities. He said the Government had tried hard to persuade the
                            “Kyonghyang Sinmun” to avoid the willful publication of false
                            information in its paper to the detriment of the Korean Government. The
                            Communists, he said, exploited falsehoods and distortions appearing in
                            the opposition press. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> pointed out that the Korean opposition,
                            however, was not Communist. He emphasized that the closure of the
                            “Kyonghyang Sinmun” moreover was the type situation that the Communist
                            propagandists could exploit effectively since it was difficult for
                            Korea’s friends to defend the Korean Government’s action. Further-more,
                            it was difficult for us to understand why the leading opposition paper,
                            which was supported by the Seoul Catholic diocese, was closed as
                            representing a threat to the Government since the Government party had
                            won a large majority in the free elections held last year. He pointed
                            out that the closure action provided ammunition to those in Congress <pb
                                n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0588"/>opposed to our aid program for
                            Korea and thereby complicates our problem of obtaining the necessary
                            funds to continue the fight against Communism. He emphasized again that
                            we could not adequately defend this action before Congress because it
                            runs counter to what Korea stands for. To the many friends of Korea in
                            the United States this action is out of character.</p>
                        <p>Minister Han said that perhaps he and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> had failed to make their
                            Government’s position clear. He said that the news-paper had been closed
                            not because it had engaged in legitimate criticism of the Korean
                            Government but because it had openly defied the Government and had
                            willfully sought to falsify information with the aim of causing the
                            people to lose confidence in their Government. In this connection,
                            Minister Han said that Korea had applied for membership in the
                            International Press Institute (<gloss target="#t_IPI1">IPI</gloss>) and
                            that six Korean press representatives had attended the recent meeting in
                            Germany at the invitation of the Institute. While recognizing that there
                            were shortcomings in the press situation in Korea, the <gloss
                                target="#t_IPI1">IPI</gloss> accepted the fact that there was
                            considerable freedom of the press in Korea. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that there had
                            previously been complete freedom of the press in Korea. However, we
                            could not possibly explain to Congress the Korean Government action in
                            closing the leading opposition paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said that he found it difficult to understand
                            the distinction between “legitimate criticism” and “defiance” of the
                            Korean Government in this instance, and he asked who determined what was
                            “legitimate criticism”. He stated that no political party of Government
                            is immune to criticism; the important thing, however, is that the
                            criticism be used constructively. He pointed out that distortions and
                            false information appear in our press as well as in the press of every
                            democracy. This is a price we pay for freedom of the press. However, we
                            feel strongly that the closure of a newspaper is not the way to deal
                            with press abuses. The extent and intensity of reaction in the United
                            States to the closure, which had had wave-like proportions, was due to
                            the fact that this occurred in an operating democracy in Asia and in a
                            country in which we considered democracy to have made remarkable
                            progress. Such an action would have only caused a ripple, he said, in a
                            country which did not know democracy. He concluded by saying that he had
                            not heard a single one of Korea’s many friends in the United States
                            defend the closure action which is a reflection of our deep concern. Dr.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> said he would probably not be able to
                            understand this action either if he were an American in view of the
                            difference in the two countries’ background and the fact that Korea was
                            not a fully developed democracy.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> explained that it seemed
                            to him and some members of the Planning Board that the bracketed
                            language proposed by the Department of State actually constituted a new
                            mission for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. He then
                            asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> to speak
                            to the proposed additional language.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> explained that
                            the language in the brackets, proposed by the State Department, had been
                            very carefully discussed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> who felt strongly that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should continue to have military
                            capabilities of a character that would give confidence to the rest of
                            Free Asia that we mean business. Therefore, the State Department did not
                            feel that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military capabilities
                            should be reduced. While Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said he did not object to the deletion of the
                            word “determination” from the State proposal, he felt that the rest of
                            the language was significant and should be included in the revised
                            Paragraph 2–d.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out in
                            the first instance that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in their written
                            comments upon this paper, supported the State Department proposal. The
                            Department of Defense on the other hand did not support the inclusion of
                            the State proposal because it seemed to Defense that there was implicit
                            in the State language a directive that the present force levels of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces should be
                            continued. To continue these forces at their present level might or
                            might not be what this Government would actually want to do in the
                            future. There was also the suggestion, continued Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>, that these <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces might be used outside of the
                            territory of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> intervened to
                            state that no such implication was intended by the State proposal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> also stated
                            that the Defense Department held very strong views on the proposed
                            revision of Paragraph 10 also bearing on <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> force levels. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1"
                                >McElroy</persName> said that it seemed to Defense that there was no
                            need to determine at this precise time whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should be maintained at their
                            current level or whether the level should be decreased in Calendar Year
                            1960. He thought it would <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0591"/>be
                            wiser to let this question be decided later in the light of the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> suggested that inasmuch as
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> had not
                            referred to Paragraph 10, it might be sensible for the Council to
                            consider this paragraph. He read the paragraph as follows: <quote

                                >Gray</persName> again solicited the views of Secretary <persName

                                corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said that the Department of
                            Defense was favorably disposed to Paragraph 10, provided the bracketed
                            language in sub-paragraph b, proposed by Treasury, Budget and <gloss
                                target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>, were deleted. The size of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in the future, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>, would depend on
                            financial resources available to us and on various other factors which
                            were not determinable. The Defense Department felt that it was necessary
                            to retain some flexibility in dealing with this problem even though it
                            was quite prepared to state the general desire of the U.S. to reduce
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels when such a
                            reduction appeared to be practicable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then referred the Council
                            to the comments of the Defense Department on the Financial Appendix
                            which accompanied the proposed new revisions in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5817. He cited particularly the Defense comment that
                            “in view of reduced Military Assistance Program resources <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0592"/>and the prospect of still further
                            reductions, fiscal limitations have become an increasingly significant
                            determinate of country programs. Korea has had to share in these overall
                            reductions and the Korean program must now generally conform to an
                            order-of-magnitude dollar limitation as well as support <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> force objectives.” In short, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>, the Defense Department
                            acknowledged that the problem of modernization was a world-wide problem.
                            Modernization furthermore would be costly and would have to be applied
                            to smaller forces than at present existed unless more funds for
                            modernization became available than could now be foreseen.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName>, speaking for the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff, explained the excruciating difficulties which had been involved
                            in inducing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to reduce
                            its armed forces to the current level of 18 divisions and 630,000 men.
                            The Joint Chiefs of Staff felt that this level of forces was required by
                            the situation in Korea and that if we put more heavy pressure on the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government, we would involve
                            ourselves in a serious political problem without being able to achieve
                            the desired reduction. While Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> pointed
                            out that most of the 18 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions
                            were 9 per cent under strength, he admitted that the cost of
                            modernization was heavy and that we would therefore be obliged to
                            modernize <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces only to the degree
                            that we could afford to do so and had the financing available. All in
                            all, Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> concluded that it was best to
                            leave the force levels as they were.</p>
                        <p>Agreeing with Admiral <persName>Burke</persName>, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out that we had a
                            certain amount of money available with which to pay for personnel in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces or to modernize the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. Such funds as we have
                            must be divided between these two requirements.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> warned that if
                            we did proceed now to cut the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            levels, we would automatically increase the already serious unemployment
                            situation in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Putting soldiers
                            into the army was perhaps the least expensive way to deal with South
                            Korean unemployment.</p>
                        <p>The President speculated as to whether we were not tacitly assuming that
                            the North Korean armed forces were going to be armed with the very
                            latest weapons. The President doubted that this would be the case.
                            Moreover, in general, the President said, he found it hard to reconcile
                            the policy suggested by the bracketed portion of Paragraph 2–d and the
                            directive in Paragraph 10–b. The language in Paragraph 2–d plainly
                            suggested no reduction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            levels whereas the language in Paragraph 10–b clearly looked forward to
                            a gradual further reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                            forces. These seemed to the President contradictory policy concepts.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> said that this was precisely why the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that the whole of Paragraph 10–b
                            should be deleted.</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>The Director of the Budget stated that of course he realized the military
                            and political difficulties involved in any further effort to reduce the
                            size of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces.
                            Nevertheless, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> felt that
                            he should point out that our policy on this subject, adopted in 1957,
                            had called for an effort to reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions to 16 active divisions. We had failed to
                            achieve this objective and moreover we had proceeded to modernize not
                            only our own U.S. forces in Korea but also some of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. We were now accordingly faced
                            with a grave financial problem. Apropos of this problem Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> cited the recommendation in the
                            Interim Report of the so-called Draper Committee<note n="10"
                                xml:id="d277fn10">See <ref target="#d268fn1">footnote 1. Document
                                    268</ref>.</note> that the number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions should be reduced to 12 although Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> pointed out also that
                            the Draper Committee recommendations called for greater modernization of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. All the same, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> insisted that it took
                            less money to modernize 12 divisions than it did to modernize 16 or 18.
                            He therefore expressed the belief that the revised paragraph should
                            contain a clear directive for further gradual reduction in the level of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>The President disagreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                                >Stans</persName> and explained that it seemed better to him that we
                            should keep the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces at their
                            present level of 630,000 men, proceeding to provide what modernization
                            for these forces we could afford to provide. Such modernization did not
                            necessarily mean that we would have to provide these <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions with all the latest weapons.
                            We would simply provide what we could afford. If we thus kept the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces at their present level of
                            strength, we would not have to face the new problem of perhaps another
                            100,000 unemployed men in South Korea. The President expressed his view
                            that he did not want the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to
                            deteriorate in their capabilities and that therefore some modernization
                            was indicated. This did not alter the fact, according to the President,
                            that it was our own U.S. forces deployed in Korea that should be the
                            main focus of modernization.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s comment on the apparent conflict between
                            the directive in the last part of Paragraph 2–d and the directive in
                            Paragraph 10 with respect to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            levels, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he
                            was obliged to concede that the language proposed by the State
                            Department in Paragraph 2–d was probably not much more than a pious
                            hope.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> suggested a revision in
                            the State proposal in Paragraph 2–d which both Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> said would be satisfactory. The Council
                            appeared to agree with this revised proposal.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon the President suggested the deletion of all of Paragraph 10–b
                            as recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The President explained
                            that while our best plan was ultimately achieving a gradual reduction
                                <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0594"/>in <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> force levels, this goal was not feasible in the
                            immediate future. Furthermore, the President expressed irritation at
                            having a large number of staff people in the Pentagon making plans which
                            no one really believed were going to be carried out in the near future.
                            In the President’s view there were just too many staff people in
                            Washington making too many staff plans.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President expressed the opinion that the level and character of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces was essentially a
                            psychological problem applying not only to South Korea but to all of
                            Free Asia. The Vice President asked which meant the most to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and the governments of the
                            other Free Asian states–men or modernization? The general answer to the
                            Vice President was that the size of the forces was thought to have
                            greater significance than their degree of modernization. If that were
                            the case, continued the Vice President, could we not cut back on the
                            resources we applied to modernization to a point where it would cost us
                            no more overall than as if we had cut back the force levels to 16
                            divisions? After all, it was clearly U.S. military power in Korea that
                            was going to be really decisive if the issue were ever joined with the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Burke</persName> observed that he was inclined to agree
                            with the Vice President’s view. Most of the savings that we could
                            anticipate making would come from the equipment item. The pay and food
                            cost for personnel in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                            forces was relatively not very high.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> said he wished
                            to make it quite clear that we were not doing very much that could be
                            described as rapid modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces. In point of fact, most of the new equipment we
                            gave them consisted of replacements for worn-out equipment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> inquired whether he
                            could persist in making one more reference to the recommendations of the
                            Draper Committee with respect to Korea. He then referred to one of the
                            recommendations of the Committee that we attempt to reduce tensions in
                            Korea by reaching some kind of an agreement with the North Korean
                            Communists which might permit a substantial reduction both in the North
                            Korean and in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> went on to urge that
                            the National Security Council suspend action on revising <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817 until the Planning Board had had
                            an opportunity to consider this and the other recommendations regarding
                            South Korea made in the Interim Report of the Draper Committee. Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> explained
                            that except for the bracketed portion which was new all the rest of
                            Paragraph 10–b was already in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817.
                            The Treasury Department felt that if we eliminated all of Paragraph
                            10–b, we would in point of fact be changing the whole direction of our
                            policy with respect to gradual reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces. If Paragraph 10–b were omitted, we would not
                            only plan no further reductions, we might indeed even find ourselves
                            shifting to plans for increasing <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0595"
                            />the level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. This, at any
                            rate, seemed the implication of deleting Paragraph 10–b entirely.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Secretary Scribner’s views, the President said he felt
                            compelled to point out one important aspect of the matter. It seemed
                            clear to him that we could not consider the Republic of Korea in a
                            vacuum. It had to be considered in the context of the world situation.
                            To illustrate his point, the President read a portion of a cable just
                            received this morning on the most recent discussion between Averell
                            Harriman and Khrushchev. Harriman had written that this interview was
                            positively terrifying and that Khrushchev had seemed to him an even more
                            dangerous enemy than Stalin. Khrushchev had talked threateningly about
                            what he would do if hostilities arose about Berlin or about Formosa. He
                            boasted that the Soviet Union had an effective <gloss target="#t_ICBM1"
                                >ICBM</gloss> while the U.S. did not. He had also boasted that he
                            had given rockets to Communist China which could effectively destroy the
                            power of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. This kind of intelligence meant to the
                            President that we could not sit down and coolly calculate whether the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was to have 16 or 19 divisions
                            without regard to other situations in the world. The President strongly
                            emphasized his view that the U.S. could not afford to be weak anywhere.
                            The U.S. could not retreat piece-meal here and there. If it did the end
                            of the process would be a “Fortress America” position. The President
                            insisted that he was not arguing that it was necessarily wrong to reduce
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces but he did insist that
                            there was a real danger that the U.S. would display weakness in too many
                            critical places in the world. While, said the President, he realized
                            that we were trying to match the Soviets in missiles, we could not
                            afford to let ourselves become weak in other areas of the struggle with
                            the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said that despite the
                            President’s view, he felt that it would be desirable for the paper to
                            state the objective of reducing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces as soon as such a course of action became practicable.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>
                            whether or not the Planning Board had made a study of the Interim Report
                            of the Draper Committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>
                            replied that the Planning Board had not considered the Draper Committee
                            Interim Report as such although the views of the Draper Committee’s
                            report with respect to Korea had been taken into account by the Planning
                            Board in presenting these proposals for a revision of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that it was extremely difficult to get any
                            real feel of the Asian complex without actually visiting Asia. This was
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s view. The
                            Vice President went on to say that the primary concern in the problem
                            under discussion was not so much the military effects but the political
                            and psychological effects of a further <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566"
                                facs="0596"/>reduction of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces. The impact of such a reduction would strike not only South Korea
                            but all of Free Asia.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName>
                            asked the President if General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> could speak to the problem. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> described the extreme
                            difficulty of negotiating the last reduction in the level of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces. He went on to say that he
                            had not personally studied the conclusions and recommendations of the
                            Draper Committee with respect to the Republic of Korea but he felt that
                            any deal with the Communists involving mutual reduction and withdrawal
                            of forces would have no basis in fact. The Communists have repeatedly
                            broken all their promises and in General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>’s view it was impossible to make a deal with
                            them as the Draper recommendations alluded to by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> appeared to recommend. Likewise
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> expressed
                            himself as strongly opposed to any further reduction in the level of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. Actually, he argued, we
                            got more for our dollar in terms of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            soldiers than we got for our dollar anywhere else in the world. He said
                            he felt very strongly on this point. He also added that actually there
                            was very little going on in the way of modernization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces as we in the U.S. understood the
                            term modernization as applied to our own forces. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces mostly got military equipment
                            that was being phased out of our own Army. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces were austere in their equipment and in every
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces had “47" tanks. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> replied that tanks of this type were being
                            moved in. The President then asked that when one calculated our military
                            assistance to Korea and provided such items as these old tanks, what do
                            we charge for such items? General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> answered that the cost was based on a reduced
                            price derived from a formula worked out in the Department of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> then resumed
                            his statement by emphasizing the need of all the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces now authorized in order to protect a frontier of
                            155 miles in length between North and South Korea. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGH1">Decker</persName> had stated that this number was
                            essential to frustrate the constant efforts of the North Koreans to
                            infiltrate South Korea and subvert the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>, with a smile, asked the
                            President’s indulgence if he read one more sentence from the Interim
                            Report of the Draper Committee. He read a sentence of which the essence
                            was that the time had come to reduce the drain both on <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S. resources. He again added his
                            previous recommendations that the Planning Board should be directed to
                            study the Draper Committee Report insofar as it related to Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that if it was the mature military judgment that we
                            need the number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces that we
                            now have to hold the line in South Korea, he could think of nothing more
                            costly than to proceed to cut the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            force levels. Let us not, said the President, make mistakes in <pb
                                n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0597"/>a hurry. Just because things at
                            the moment are quiet on the Korean front did not mean that they would
                            remain so. While the President said he was all for having the Planning
                            Board proceed to study the Draper Committee Report, he would prefer now
                            to follow the line of policy provided in General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s statement in favor of
                            maintaining the status quo in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            force levels and modernizing these <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions with phased-out U.S. equipment.</p>
                        <p>(The Vice President left the meeting at 10:05 a.m.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCone observed that he was around Washington in 1949 and 1950 when
                            we pulled most of our forces out of Korea with the well-known results.
                            This, he feared, could happen again. He thought that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldier was pretty cheap in terms of
                            what we were actually buying with him, and he expressed himself as well
                            impressed by General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then stated that Paragraph
                            10–b would be deleted and that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Planning Board would proceed to study those sections of the Draper
                            Report relating to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then invited the Council’s
                            attention to the proposed new Paragraph 9–a reading as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Continue to deploy in Korea a minimum of two U.S. infantry
                                    divisions, one U.S. Army missile command, one U.S. Air Force
                                    tactical missile unit, and U.S. Air Force units, rotating on a
                                    continuing basis, with an over-all capability at least as great
                                    as the capability of the U.S. fighter-bomber wing on station in
                                    Korea throughout <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958,
                                    together with necessary support forces.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The President studied the text of Paragraph 9–a for a moment and then
                            asked whether the military people present really liked to see so much
                            tactical detail in a general policy statement. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> replied that in general our
                            military people disapproved of paragraphs going into such detail as
                            Paragraph 9–a but since something like this paragraph was already in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5817, the Defense Department had
                            thought it would be unwise to seek its removal. Admittedly, inclusion of
                            this paragraph would make it harder to change the types of units which
                            the U.S. would deploy in Korea and would in general tend to much
                            rigidity. Still, in this instance, Defense thought it best to have the
                            paragraph included. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> commented that if the paragraph remained in the
                            paper, its punctuation should be cleaned up. Attorney General Rogers
                            thought that the paragraph could be eliminated and a footnote in
                            explanation inserted. The President, however, suggested new and more
                            general language for Paragraph 9–a which met with the approval of the
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then turned to the
                            proposed Paragraph 14 reading as follows: <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568"
                                facs="0598"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Continue to strengthen the governmental and democratic

                                    to make clear to the Government of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                        >ROK</gloss> the importance with which the United States

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The President immediately commented that he thought he saw the hand of
                            the State Department in the phraseology in Paragraph 14. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>, however, explained that the
                            original source of the language was the Bureau of the Budget which had
                            suggested originally U.S. assistance to Korea be made contingent upon
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government’s strengthening
                            democratic institutions. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> commented that he had no objection to Paragraph
                            14 as now written although he would have objected to the qualification
                            on U.S. assistance originally proposed by the Budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then turned to the last
                            proposed Paragraphs, 24 and 24–A.</p>
                        <p>The President, upon reviewing the new language suggested by the State
                            Department for Paragraph 24, stated that it seemed to him that we would
                            be asking for trouble if President <persName>Rhee</persName> were ever
                            to learn that if he moved unilaterally against North Korea, it was U.S.
                            policy to bail him out and defend South Korea against the inevitable
                            Communist counter-attack. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> likewise shared the President’s anxiety lest
                            knowledge of this policy become an invitation to
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> to march north unilaterally. In reply Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> pointed out that this
                            policy guidance would be contained in an Annex with the same extremely
                            limited distribution now given to Annex F of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5817. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>
                            agreed that if <persName>Rhee</persName> should ever get wind of this
                            policy, it could serve as an invitation to him to march north.
                            Nevertheless, it seemed to be the view of the Government that we would
                            have to undertake to protect the integrity of South Korea against
                            Communist counter-attack even if <persName>Rhee</persName> ordered his
                            troops to march into North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether in fact this would be our policy?
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> pointed out
                            that there were lots of other things we could do if
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> started to march north, including throwing
                            out the <persName>Rhee</persName> regime. The President insisted that
                            the only hope of preventing <persName>Rhee</persName> from taking such
                            an action would be a clear and forceful U.S. disavowal of
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s action.</p>
                        <p>Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MENH1">McElroy</persName> agreed with
                            the last statement that the President had made but said that the
                            statement did not answer the problem of what we would do in the event
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> marched north and the result was a
                            Communist counter-attack against the Republic of Korea. We certainly
                            could not let the Communists take over South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether it was really possible, given the general
                            loyalty of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command, for President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> to launch an attack unilaterally against
                            North Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName><pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0599"
                            />replied that the contingency was highly unlikely. The danger of such
                            unilateral action was more remote now than it had ever been and insisted
                            that no major attack could be started by President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> without the prompt knowledge of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> then proposed a
                            new revision of Paragraph 24–A and read it. The President commented with
                            respect to the new proposal that if we became aware that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> was moving north to attack North Korea, we
                            would simply have to remove <persName>Rhee</persName> and his
                            government. Such a move would simply have to be stopped. Again Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> agreed with the
                            President but asked how we proposed to keep the Communists from
                            counter-attacking and seizing South Korea. The President stated with
                            emphasis that everything possible must be done to stop a unilateral
                            South Korean move on North Korea before it started, including deposing
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>. Thereafter, if South Korea wanted to go
                            on to commit suicide, we would say go ahead and do it. Nevertheless,
                            said the President, he thought this whole problem highly academic. If
                            ever this attack on North Korea occurred, the President said that the
                            military alliance between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea would be
                            broken at that moment. We would then have to decide what was necessary
                            to do in defense of our own interests. Admiral
                                <persName>Burke</persName> suggested that this last statement of the
                            President’s might very well provide for a new version of Paragraph 24–A.
                            This view was accepted and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> also suggested a drafting change in Paragraph
                            24–f.</p>

                        <p>On June 29 and 30, the Liberal Party held its ninth national convention
                            in Seoul. The convention was the first held since 1957 and was attended
                            by over 1,000 delegates. On June 29 the delegates nominated President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> for a fourth term and decided to leave to
                            the Chief Executive the choice of a running mate.
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> selected Assembly Speaker <persName
                                corresp="#p_YK2">Yi Ki-pung</persName> as the party’s Vice
                            Presidential candidate and the convention confirmed his choice. In
                            despatch 51 from Seoul, August 3, the Embassy analyzed what was seen as
                            the “surprising” decision to hold the Liberal Party convention almost a
                            year in advance of the scheduled elections: “The prime reasons for this
                            action are thought to be an <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> attempt to
                            head off intraparty rivalry over the Vice Presidential nomination and to
                            generate increased dissension with the opposition Democratic Party, by
                            forcing it to nominate its own candidates before it would have wanted to
                            do so.” (Department of State, Central Files, 795B.00/8–359) See

                            <p>5. U.S. interests are deeply involved in Korea. Unless the United
                                States continues to provide strong political, military and economic
                                support to the Republic of Korea, the Communist bloc probably will
                                ultimately succeed in extending its control over the whole of Korea.
                                Such a development would undermine Free World security in the
                                Northeast Asia area, and (because of the symbolic importance of
                                Korea with respect to alliances and collective security) would be
                                seriously detrimental to U.S. policy of supporting peace and justice
                                through the United Nations and to the general struggle against
                                Communism throughout the Far East.</p>
                            <p>6. In the light of the above, U.S. objectives should also take into
                                account the importance of reducing Korean dependence on U.S.
                                assistance and making greater progress toward the ultimate goal of a
                                self-supporting economy.</p>
                            <p>7. The United Nations’ role with respect to Korea is an asset in the
                                struggle against Communism. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                provided the principal legal basis for successful resistance against
                                Communist aggression. Initiatives have come from the United States,
                                but the general support of the United Nations and the allies of the
                                United States is of great psychological force, both with respect to
                                world opinion and the attitudes of the Republic of Korea.</p>

                            <p>8. Pending a political settlement, and in the absence of a renewal of

                                requested to prepare an assessment of President

                                light of reports that he was failing and that decisions in Korea
                                were being made by a palace guard. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,
                                795B.11/7–3159) See Supplement.</note> Statement that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s personal control over <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> policies and operations is weakening,
                            while true, needs explanation, for in literal sense it can be asserted
                            that his control remains absolute.</p>
                        <p>It has long been practice of Mrs. <persName>Rhee</persName>, with
                            collaboration presidential assistant Park Chan-il, to try to shield
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> from problems which may disturb him,
                            at times taking decisions in his name when it is fairly certain that he
                            will not become aware of them. Recently with <persName>Rhee</persName>’s
                            physical and mental powers diminishing, and with uncontrolled outside
                            sources of information less readily available to him (he reads fewer
                            papers and sees fewer people), opportunity for such practice is greater,
                            and I surmise that Park Chan-il is now playing increasingly powerful
                            role, probably with tacit consent of Mrs. <persName>Rhee</persName>.
                            This is not to say that final decision, particularly in significant or
                            controversial matters, does not lie with <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            himself, but with tendentious presentation of case, I believe Park
                            Chan-il can generally obtain decisions he advocates, at least within
                            frame-work of <persName>Rhee</persName>’s long-established policies and
                            prejudices.</p>
                        <p>I surmise too that Cabinet Ministers are now frequently resorting to same
                            tactics to obtain desired decisions. As I have reported,
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> has encouraged his Ministers to assume
                            more responsibility, and this they are doing, although generally only in
                            matters which in most governments would be regarded as purely routine.
                            To some extent, this has been forced upon them, since with exception of
                            Ministers of Home Affairs, Finance, Defense and Justice and Vice
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, their contacts with
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> are now confined largely to Cabinet
                            meetings. (Another consequence is that Cabinet Ministers must often rely
                            on Park Chan-il to obtain <persName>Rhee</persName>’s decision on
                            written briefs submitted to him, thus enhancing Park’s influence in
                            these fields.)</p>
                        <p>There are, however, checks and balances to this system of decision
                            making. General Won Yon Duu is still used by <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            as an informant though perhaps less extensively than formerly. Kwak,
                            Chief of Kyung <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0611"/>Mu Dae police
                            and devoted to <persName>Rhee</persName>, exerts great personal
                            influence on him in an informal way through private conversations, for
                            which there are daily opportunities. <persName corresp="#p_HC4">Huh
                                Chung</persName>, one of <persName>Rhee</persName>’s oldest friends,
                            who always re-emerges after periodic eclipses, is reputed to be able to
                            speak frankly and persuasively with <persName>Rhee</persName> when he is
                            in favor. Finally, Yi Kipoong’s influence apparently remains second only
                            to that of <persName>Rhee</persName> himself. Although <persName
                                corresp="#p_YK2">Yi</persName> sees President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> far less frequently than formerly
                            (allegedly because he fears too close observation by
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> of his growing infirmities) Cabinet
                            Ministers as well as Park Chan-il formally report fully to him, and he
                            often uses Home and Justice Ministers as envoys to
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> on domestic political matters.</p>
                        <p>In fact, it can be said that increasing number of decisions are being
                            taken by <persName>Rhee</persName>’s subordinates, notably Park Chan-il,
                            and that even in vital matters, where <persName>Rhee</persName> is
                            always consulted, there is no doubt that his decisions are often taken
                            without benefit of full information. It must be emphasized, however,
                            that if for some reason <persName>Rhee</persName> makes a decision on
                            his own initiative, or contrary to that desired or expected by his
                            subordinates, such decisions would be carried out without question or at
                            minimum regarding as binding until <persName>Rhee</persName> could be
                            persuaded to accept some other course.</p>
                        <p>As for President <persName>Rhee</persName> himself, reports alleging his
                            mental deterioration deserve, as <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>
                            is aware, from <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials in
                            regular contact with him and from visitors who have known him
                            previously. All agree that, as confirmed by doctor’s reports he is in
                            remarkable physical condition for a man of 84 years, although noticeably
                            feebler in voice and gait, but they see clear evidence of reduction in
                            mental acuity. My own observation is that compared with three years ago,
                            there has been marked deterioration both mentally and physically, though
                            this deterioration may be painfully obvious one day and far less evident
                            the next. To me, one of most significant indications is his preference
                            now for exchange of pleasantries with visitors, and his inclination
                            towards reminiscences, whereas formerly he was apt to utilize every
                            occasion for substantive discussion or for expounding his views. My
                            recent conversations confirm that he is increasingly forgetful, and that
                            it is necessary to explain and re-explain ideas and suggestions before
                            grasps meaning or significance, although if his interest or ire is
                            sufficiently aroused his performance can still be impressive.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces has become matter urgent
                            necessity. Not only amount several serious deficiencies anticipated
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for 1960, as detailed below, but
                            anticipated local currency support for military program falls short of
                            what both <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US military
                            authorities consider minimum required. Overly optimistic tax and
                            counterpart estimates contained in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            1960 budget make it problematical whether defense budget now before

                            can be fully supported. In light growing counterpart shortage, Country

                            1961 and allocation for military budget support 1960 must be reduced
                            from 53 to 50 billion hwan. Even this reduced figure for military budget
                            support is now questionable in light deeper cut in <gloss

                        <p>In view these circumstances, I believe that, rather than try to hold on
                            to force level which appears to be larger than our combined resources
                            can maintain adequately and which almost certainly will have to be
                            reduced sooner or later, we should be using available resources to
                            develop and maintain somewhat smaller force with increased fire-power. I
                            recommend, therefore, that Washington agencies, as matter of urgency,
                                <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0613"/>reach some conclusion on

                            resources for 1960 and beyond be devoted to that end. We cannot afford

                            concern over “lagging” US interest in defense of Korea and are worried

                            cutback in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and counterpart support.
                            We cannot expect <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to maintain
                            high morale, state of alertness and training standards if cutback in
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and counterpart support requires
                            maintenance forces at bare subistence level or less.</p>
                        <p>Military leaders are likely be particularly disappointed and discouraged
                            by lack of progress in force improvement and modernization which will
                            add to their fear of “being left behind” and forgotten. Official
                            government reaction undoubtedly will be critical and we can expect
                            statements in government controlled press to effect defenses this
                            critical area being weakened in face Communist buildup and US being
                            taken in by Russia’s pretensions of peaceful goals. I do not expect,
                            however, that adverse reaction will have any serious effect on our basic
                            relationships. On positive side, reduced <gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                        <p>If US decides that further reduction <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces is necessary, reaction on part <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> military leader and government would be one of strong
                            opposition. As <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> aware, President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> is insistent on need maintain present
                            level forces. Although number of military and government leaders are
                            increasingly aware of problems outlined above, and are tending to look
                            to modernization of smaller force as answer, we must expect them fully
                            to support <persName>Rhee</persName>’s position. If, therefore, US
                            decides force reduction is advisable, we can expect long and frustrating
                            negotiations to ensue. On other hand if <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s become convinced that alternatives are between austere
                            maintenance of present force–with possibility of gradual

                            reluctant choice will almost certainly be latter alternative. In working
                            toward this objective, I think <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            should be designed to meet maintenance and training requirements of

                        <p>To sum up, my view is that if U.S. is unable provide more adequately for

                            indicated by <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>s and therefore

                            this decision by reducing funds for force maintenance and training and

                            suggested above. Such a shift of emphasis, however, would not reduce

                            however, and as 1960 campaign approaches and lines harden this
                            possibility becomes even more remote. Split in Democratic ranks might be
                            conducive such development; but if Democrats emerge united from October
                            nominating convention, I believe such realignment before 1960 elections
                            very unlikely.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that in period up to and through 1960 elections we
                            must be prepared for further political crises in which <gloss

                            maintain itself in power. While <persName>Rhee</persName>’s chances
                            victory in relatively fair contest are reasonably good, obviously
                            greater difficulty electing <persName corresp="#p_YK2">Yi

                            extensive interference in campaign and subversion ballot. This almost

                        <p>My views on US role under those circumstances, consequences our inaction,
                            and risks involved in attempting influence <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> domestic political situation continue be those outlined
                            in my memorandum of January 23. Our recent prodding <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, mentioned <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss>, has evoked customary defensive reaction from
                            government. But I do not feel this situation has limited our capacity
                            for bringing influence to bear on domestic front provided we choose our
                            weapons carefully and employ them firmly but discreetly. Moreover,
                            unlike situations involving <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese
                            repatriation dispute, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership,

                            within <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> and government.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend, therefore, following courses of action, again within
                            context indicated my earlier memorandum: 1) encourage widest possible US
                            and international news and editorial coverage as soon as possible and
                            certainly immediately before and during 1960 elections, including
                            presence in Korea maximum number newsmen at election times; 2) visits to
                            Korea by leading members Congress and other prominent public figures,
                            who can be depended upon to speak out in support our policies. Effort
                            should be made through such visits impress <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            with concern American Government and people re recent political trends
                            Korea and real possibility such concern may affect ability US continue

                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Particularly, it should be made clear
                            to President <persName>Rhee</persName> that continued undemocratic
                            actions certain to evoke widespread criticism in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> which US will not be in position to restrain; 3) <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> activities should give particular
                            emphasis to dissemination information basic requirements free elections
                            and responsibilities individual citizens. Where possible this should be
                            facilitated by visits of US lecturers and experts, and to extent
                            possible private Korean groups should be encouraged to participate in a
                            program of citizenship education; 4) we should continue cautious
                            attitude on aid to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> police and
                            consideration should be given possibility temporary increase carefully
                            selected US police advisors who can determine whether police being used
                            for partisan purposes. It should be made clear to <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that use police for such purposes would
                            result in cancellation projected police aid program; 5) widest possible
                            observation campaign and balloting by Embassy and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> observers. I would also suggest,
                            Department might consider consultations with other members “sixteen
                            nations,” particularly <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australia,
                            concerning ways they may assist in this or make any other contribution
                            free elections 1960; 6) if, in addition to above, we decide to apply
                            economic pressure, it must be of sort which would have major impact. One
                            possibility would be to announce $150 or $160 million DS aid level
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 60 with balance Korean allocation
                            held in contingency reserve. We could explain publicly reserve is for
                            possible use meet emergency requirements elsewhere. At some time we
                            would inform Government that US public and congressional concern over
                            recent political deterioration <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has
                            made it impossible Executive Branch maintain program level but that, if
                            all goes well, supplemental amount might be made available towards end
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> (viz after May elections). This
                            kind of pressure might not work, but I think it would be worth economic
                            risks involved. It is most effective way I know to demonstrate our deep
                            concern over recent trends.</p>

                            decade from which Korea can move toward effective and stable democratic
                            government. Koreans display a degree of political consciousness the more
                            remarkable against a background prolonged Japanese occupation and
                            Korea’s own political and cultural traditions. We must also not forget
                            that there is significantly large group, including many those who will
                            furnish Korea’s future leaders, who are intellectually and emotionally
                            committed to success democratic experiment Korea. These favorable
                            factors, however, highly vulnerable to disillusionment born of

                            views. As I suggested in my memorandum, such disillusionment could offer
                            fertile field for exploitation by extremists of left and right.</p>
                        <p>In this context, 1960 elections take on especial significance. These
                            elections will undoubtedly be last in era dominated by personality
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> and may well determine political
                            course Korea will take when that turning point reached. If, therefore,
                            they are characterized by flagrant abuse democratic institutions, there
                            is real danger that many those now committed development democratic
                            government will conclude it a futile cause.</p>
                        <p>Little time remains, however, in which we can effectively bring our
                            influence to bear on this situation. We must either decide now what we
                            intend to do and move forward promptly or risk by default a development
                            which in longer pull can only run counter our national interests.</p>

                        <p>YOU will recall that former Ambassador to Korea, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Walter Dowling</persName>, was recalled to the
                            Department early last January for consultation in connection with the
                            undemocratic methods used to pass a revised National Security Law and
                            other legislation in the Korea National Assembly on December 24 and the
                            resulting political crisis. In response to Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ request, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> submitted an analysis of the
                            situation and proposed plan of action on January 24 [23] (Tab A).<note

                            <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0620"/>Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> pointed out that considerable
                            progress had been achieved in the development of democratic institutions
                            and processes in the Republic of Korea. He continued, however, that the
                            success of the opposition Democratic Party in the May 1958 elections and
                            the declining popularity of the Liberal Party had convinced certain
                            elements of the Liberal Party (known as the “hard faction”) that this
                            Party could only retain political power by authoritarian methods.
                            Furthermore, it appeared that this faction had succeeded in convincing
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> that suppressive measures must be
                            taken against the Democratic Party and other opposition elements in
                            order to ensure his re-election in the 1960 Presidential election.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> continued that
                            the United States Government was faced with two alternatives, either a
                            passive disinterested role or a positive course of action to influence
                            the situation. Despite the serious risks which the latter entailed, he
                            believed that the United States’ interests in Korea would suffer
                            disastrously if the United States remained passive in the face of the
                            situation. He therefore recommended that certain actions be undertaken
                            to restore normal parliamentary functions and the operation of the
                            political party system and to prevent the eventual use of totalitarian
                            actions to suppress the opposition and cure the free press. Among his
                            specific recommendations were (a) the encouragement of the stationing of
                            American reporters in Seoul, (b) the visiting of the Republic of Korea
                            by prominent members of Congress, (c) formal protests to the Korean
                            Government of various violations of the Republic of Korea-United States
                            financial stabilization agreement, combined with discreet indications
                            that additional aid might be withheld until corrective action was taken,
                            (d) procrastination on negotiations for new <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >P.L.</gloss> 480 agreement, (e) the withdrawal of our aid program
                            for the Republic of Korea police, (f) other dilatory actions with
                            respect to aid expenditures, and (g) the complete coordination of the
                            actions and statements regarding Korea within the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>’s courses of
                            action were approved on January 27 by Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> but were only incompletely put into
                            operation. On February 16, the chairman of the Operations Coordinating
                            Board forwarded a memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">Not printed.

                            and other members of the Operations Coordinating Board requesting the

                                >Not found attached; printed as <ref target="#d282">Document
                                    282</ref>.</note> the Ambassador pointed out that, although
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName>’s chances of victory in a relatively
                            fair contest are reasonably good, this is almost certainly the last
                            election in which he will participate. Liberal Party leaders are
                            therefore more acutely conscious than ever of the problems of succession
                            and, consequently, are sparing no effort to prevent a repetition of the
                            1956 defeat of their vice-presidential candidate. Within the past six
                            months, there has been a slow but steady tightening at every level of
                            the Administration’s governmental and political controls. This has been
                            accompanied by plans for an all-out propaganda and organizational
                            campaign in order to reverse the growing popular dissatisfaction with
                            the Administration and particularly to intensify the psychological and
                            material pressures against those sympathetic to the opposition.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> has indicated
                            that he believes we still have a chance to bring influence to bear on
                            the domestic political front to prevent flagrant abuses of democratic
                            institutions and processes provided we choose our weapons carefully and
                            employ them firmly but discreetly. Such actions would have the support
                            of the majority of the Korean people and moderate leadership groups even
                            within the Liberal Party and Government. He therefore has recommended
                            (1) the widest possible United States and international news and
                            editorial coverage of the Korean scene, (2) visits by the members of
                            Congress and other prominent figures to impress upon President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and others the dangers inherent in the
                            present situation which may affect the United States ability to continue
                            to actively support the Republic of Korea, (3) emphasis by <gloss
                                target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> on the dissemination of information
                            on the basic requirements of free elections and democracy, (4) the
                            re-examination of our aid to the Republic of Korea police, and (5) the
                            widest possible observation of election campaign by Embassy and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> observers.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued that, in addition to the above, if the decision
                            to apply economic pressure is made, it must necessarily be of the sort
                            which would have a major impact. One possibility he outlined would be to
                            announce a $150–160 million Defense Support Aid Level for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960, with the balance of the Korean
                            allocation held in an undisclosed contingency reserve, and an intimation
                            to the Republic of Korea Government that supplemental aid might be made
                            available after the elections if all goes well. These subsequent
                            proposals are very similar to those made by the Ambassador in his
                            January memorandum.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the time has come when we must take action in Korea to
                            prevent further deterioration of the political situation. In such a <pb
                                n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0622"/>country as the Republic of
                            Korea with our massive military and economic aid, the United States is
                            deeply involved in the situation and development of the country. We have
                            become identified not only throughout Korea but throughout most of the
                            world as the sponsor of the Republic of Korea. Consequently, the failure
                            of democracy in Korea would be considered by many nations as the total
                            failure of the applicability of our system for the nations of Afro-Asia,
                            with the subsequent decline of American influence and prestige within
                            this area. Our immediate objective must therefore be to halt and reverse
                            the trend toward a totalitarian regime in Korea and assure as far as
                            possible that a fair and free election for President will be held in
                            1960 by bringing the weight of United States influence upon the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and the pro-Government
                            Liberal Party to the extent that it is not self-defeating. At a minimum,
                            our actions must include nothing which could be construed by President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and the Liberal Party as endorsing their
                            undemocratic actions. As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> has emphasized, the 1960 elections will
                            undoubtedly be the last in the era dominated by the personality of
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> and well may determine the political
                            course that Korea will take when that turning point is reached. The
                            failure of democracy in Korea at this critical juncture can only lead to
                            the disillusionment of the Korean people, not only with democratic
                            principles and practices, but with the United States to whom these
                            people for over the past decade looked for leadership and guidance. In
                            the ensuing vacuum, we fear that only extremist solutions can
                            result.</p>
                        <p>The courses of action which we propose are based mainly on Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>’s recommendations and
                            on the premise that we must be prepared to carry through any actions
                            initiated and that under no circumstances can there be any impairment of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength. We submit the
                            following courses of action, therefore, for your approval. (Additional
                            courses of action which might subsequently appear useful should not, of
                            course, be excluded.)</p>

                                officials are particularly sensitive to press criticism, especially
                                by the American press, we should endeavor to encourage not only the
                                stationing of American reporters in Seoul (there are none there now)
                                but the widest possible news and editorial coverage of the political
                                scene. This might be combined with editorial and perhaps magazine
                                articles in leading periodicals. The presence in Korea of a maximum
                                number of newspapermen, expecially before and during the 1960
                                elections, should be encouraged. Foreign resources can expose
                                government interference in electoral processes to international
                                opinion, while at the same time, such actions might encourage
                                domestic reporters to provide a more accurate coverage of the

                                year 1960 (from $211 million to $182.5 million) were partly due to
                                the difficulties of arousing enthusiastic support for Korea in
                                Congress because of recent political developments and, if matters

                                such future aid cuts as may occur would almost as a matter of course
                                be increased in severity. On the other hand, if the American people
                                and the Congress were convinced that real progress has been made
                                toward democracy and economic viability in Korea, support for Korea
                                would be much easier to engender.</item>

                                not believe it advisable or probably necessary at the present time
                                to consider further aid reductions. The threat of withdrawal of
                                future aid, combined with the actual reductions in <gloss
                                    target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 aid, should exert a wholesome

                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. Further cutting the
                                United States aid level for political reasons is likely in our
                                opinion to create more problems than it would solve. However, if it
                                becomes necessary to exert economic pressure on the Korean
                                Government, the United States refused to permit the use of aid funds
                                for such political purposes as certain irrigation projects and the
                                rice lien program and our strict insistence on <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Jack</persName></hi>: In the last few
                            months, discussions have been held by members of your staff and mine in
                            the course of which we have been asked to express our views on the
                            question of the provision of dual-capable weapons to the Republic of
                            Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.) I have been informed <pb
                                n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0627"/>that some time ago <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> proposed the transfer to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army of one Nike-Hercules
                            battalion, but that the Department of Defense subsequently withdrew this
                            proposal from the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Korea because of fund limitations.
                            Nevertheless, members of your staff have requested an expression of this
                            Department’s views on the subject of transferring certain dual-capable
                            weapons to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces in
                            anticipation, when budgetary conditions permit, of providing such
                            weapons as the Nike-Hercules and Hawk to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Army.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the current <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for Korea includes the programming of
                            one Nike-Hercules and one Hawk battalion to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Army and we have given our general agreement to the
                            overall program, reserving our decision regarding the inclusion of such
                            new weapons pending complete justification by the Department of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>We fully appreciate the seriousness of the air threat from north Korea in
                            view of the current estimate indicating a four or five to one
                            superiority of the north Korean air force over that of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and we agree that there is a genuine
                            need to provide the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with the
                            Nike-Hercules and Hawk systems in order to strengthen its air defense.
                            We feel strongly that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            establishment must be maintained as a conventional force and that it
                            should be understood that the provision of these weapons constitutes
                            nothing more than the equipping of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> with more modern and powerful, but conventional,
                            weapons. In our view, a conventional capability is highly important from
                            the stand-point of a time-phased reaction to a Communist probe. As was
                            demonstrated at Quemoy, tranquilization can be achieved by a graduated
                            conventional response which may be stepped up until the degree of risk
                            for the Communist aggressor becomes greater than that which he was
                            prepared to accept. If we were to lack conventional strength, our choice
                            of withdrawal in the face of Communist attack or resort to nuclear
                            retaliation must be faced at once, without the advantage of time in
                            which graduated military plus diplomatic and psychological measures
                            could prove effective. Thus, there should be no question but that the
                            Nike-Hercules and Hawk would be provided as <hi rend="italic">defensive,
                                non-nuclear</hi> weapons. We, of course, presume that if the
                            Communists should mount an attack from outside the Korean peninsula
                            utilizing non-Korean forces, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            could not long survive without massive assistance from our own
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Well before the subject of these weapons is broached with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, we consider it incumbent upon us to
                            consult with the “Sixteen”, starting first with the United Kingdom and
                            other Commonwealth members. In 1957 and in 1958 we assured several of
                            the “Sixteen” that we did not intend to provide the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with dual-capable weapons. Moreover, we
                            so informed the United Kingdom in writing at its request. All of the
                            “Sixteen” have a deep interest and vital concern in what we do in the
                            military <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0628"/>field in Korea and it
                            is certainly in our best interests to maintain the maximum international
                            support for our policies in Korea and to do our utmost to avoid any
                            reduction in participation in the United Nations Command. We believe
                            that the concern of the United Kingdom and others of the “Sixteen”
                            stems, in large part at least, from the fear that by providing such
                            weapons we would actually be undertaking to convert the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces into a nuclear-equipped
                            establishment. This, of course, is a mistaken idea and we would wish to
                            make this point to them at the appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>We are also convinced that it is imperative for us to avoid any premature
                            disclosure of our internal planning for the provision of these weapons
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>–not only in regard to public
                            statements but also in regard to any intimation to Korean officials.
                            This position is dictated by a desire not to allow the present Korean
                            administration, by premature knowledge and publicity, (1) to use such a
                            step on our part for its own domestic political purposes in connection
                            with the forthcoming Korean presidential election, (2) to arouse fears
                            among the “Sixteen” that we might be in effect encouraging President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>’s military ambitions or converting the
                            Korean military establishment to a nuclear force, or (3) to assume a
                            more threatening posture vis-à-vis Japan and thus play into the hands of
                            the left wing in Japan in a crucial period prior to the ratification of
                            the revised United States-Japan Security Treaty. Our concern about any
                            disclosure is, of course, temporary, inasmuch as the consultations with
                            the “Sixteen”, the ratification of the new United States-Japan Security
                            Treaty and the next Korean presidential election should all be completed
                            by the end of next spring. Thereafter, we would naturally assume that
                            the necessary confidential discussions with <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> officials could begin in order to implement this
                            program–assuming funds have been made available.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your reaction to the points I have made, and I know
                            that you will keep me informed as your planning regarding this matter
                            develops.</p>
                        <p>With best personal regards,</p>

                            of the direction in which the Liberal Party is moving. At the same time,
                            activities have been undertaken to solicit the military vote for the
                            Liberal Party, including the formulation by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss><gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> of a detailed

                            Party.</p>
                        <p>Over the past half year several re-elections were held for National
                            Assembly seats which had been invalidated by the Supreme Court because
                            of irregularities in the 1958 elections. In all of these elections the
                            Liberal Party won by ever-increasing majorities. Our Embassy has
                            affirmed that the most recent re-elections were marked by the
                            application of intensive pressures by the government, Liberal Party and
                            the Korean Anti-Communist Youth Corps. Special plain clothes police were
                                <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0631"/>brought into the districts
                            and governmental officials, including school teachers and village
                            chiefs, actively canvassed for Liberal Party nominees. On election day
                            the majority of the voters wore Liberal Party arm bands and cast ballots
                            by teams. Whole villages voted at specific times and many voters cast
                            open ballots (showing of marked ballots to election officials or the
                            voting team). The Embassy commented that these tactics may represent
                            “outstanding successful dress rehearsals for the 1960 attempt to win
                            huge majorities and thus overwhelm [expected]<note n="2"

                        <p>There is little doubt that the <persName>Rhee</persName> Administration’s
                            decision to hold the elections earlier than usual on March 15 was a
                            political move to capitalize on the Liberal Party’s advance preparations
                            and to take advantage of the disorganization in the faction-ridden
                            opposition party. Moreover, this move was taken after the announcement
                            of the departure for medical treatment of the opposition party’s
                            candidate, although it appears that this move may have been decided some
                            time before Dr. <persName>Cho</persName>’s illness became known.</p>
                        <p>During the past two weeks further evidence of the Liberal Party’s
                            determination to secure victory for its candidates has developed. In
                            addition to requiring students to attend school last Sunday during a
                            Democratic Party rally in a major city, the National Police were
                            apparently employed to post pictures of <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1"
                                >Chang Myon</persName> smearing him as a former Japanese
                            collaborator. A tour of the two southern provinces by Embassy officers
                            March 1–6 led Embassy Seoul to conclude that, on the basis of
                            observations made on this trip, it is apparent that the opposition is

                        <p>On March 1 the Democratic Party publicly disclosed that it had uncovered
                            details of Liberal Party plans to perpetrate massive election frauds.
                            The target was to obtain 85 percent of the vote for the Liberal Party.
                            According to this report, methods to be used included stuffing of the
                            ballot boxes, double votes by government supporters, open voting,
                            barring of many known opposition supporters from the polls, restriction
                            of the activities of opposition election committee representatives and
                            observers, and mobilization of the Korean Anti-Communist Youth Corps.
                            Although these charges were denied by the Home Minister, a U.S. Eighth
                            Army G2 report<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4">Not found.</note> intimates
                            that the information may be authentic. Considering the past record of
                            the <persName>Rhee</persName> Administration, it is <pb n="602"
                                xml:id="pg_602" facs="0632"/>indeed quite probable that there is a
                            large element of truth in these charges.</p>
                        <p>We understand that most of the major wire services and many leading
                            journals will send reporters to cover the elections. At the same time
                            the Embassy is planning a comprehensive observation of the campaign and
                            election day activities. <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>,
                            which has received <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
                            assurances of cooperation, plans to send out five observation teams
                            during the final days of the campaign and the British and French
                            Embassies may also participate on a very limited basis. We are under no
                            illusions, however, that such participation of outside observers will
                            have any inhibiting effect whatever on the determination of the
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> Administration and the Liberal Party to
                            let nothing stand in the way of a landslide victory at the polls.
                            Previous intimations to President <persName>Rhee</persName> and Liberal
                            Party officials by Congressmen and other United States officials
                            concerning prevailing undemocratic practices have not had any tangible
                            deterring effect. It does not appear that the United States can take
                            further steps to prevent further abuse of democratic processes in Korea
                            without doing violence to our own principle of non-intervention in
                            domestic affairs of foreign sovereign states.</p>

                            appear that the March 15 elections will have at least the following
                            effects: (1) a serious setback to the operation of democratic

                            involving the mass frustration of the opposition minority party to an

                            will be particularly reflected in the United Nations, (3) a decrease in

                            Congress, particularly in connection with the economic aid program, and
                            (4) a compounding of the Department’s problems in dealing with the
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> Government, which, by reason of the

                                taken by Democratic Party leaders in Seoul on March 15 to withdraw
                                officially from the election in protest against election abuses by
                                the Liberal Party. Rioting developed when police attempted to
                                disperse a large crowd, composed largely of students, which had
                                gathered in front of the local Democratic Party headquarters.

                        <p>The Secretary stated that he first wanted to talk to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> about the presidential elections
                            in Korea. He said he wished to emphasize our concern over the reports
                            which we have received concerning <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607"
                                facs="0637"/>riots and incidents of violence as well as charges of
                            irregularities occurring in the course of the elections. The Secretary
                            expressed particular concern with respect to the United States public
                            reaction and especially that of the Congress to these reports. He
                            indicated that they might affect adversely our Korean aid program. The
                            trend of events in Korea with respect to the elections has been
                            distressing to us particularly in view of the absence of an opposition
                            candidate to President <persName>Rhee</persName>. Pressures appear to
                            have been used in the electoral campaign which the Secretary said he was
                            sure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> would agree
                            exceeded the norm of democratic practices and processes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said that he had
                            also been concerned by the reports of violence in connection with the
                            elections in Korea. He said that he had sent telegrams to President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> regarding these reports since President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> is not always informed about what is going
                            on in Korea. President <persName>Rhee</persName>, he said, has
                            repeatedly stated that the culprits involved in these incidents must be
                            arrested and punished. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> stated these riots are not “just a result of
                            intimidation”. He recalled that while Dr. <persName>Cho</persName> was
                            at <persName>Walter</persName> Reed Hospital he had asked him for his
                            views on the outcome of the elections and that Dr.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> had said that he was sure that he would not
                            be elected President of Korea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> stressed that President <persName>Rhee</persName>
                            did not need to campaign to be reelected. The fight, he said, was
                            between the opposing vice presidential candidates. Unfortunately, he
                            said, the question of religion had been introduced into the campaign.
                            The Catholics in Korea had said that they were being persecuted.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said that
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> had written to him to say that the
                            Catholics were doing good work in Korea and that there was no reason why
                            he should persecute them. President <persName>Rhee</persName>, he
                            continued, has sent a number of telegrams saying that there is no
                            religious persecution in Korea and that he would take necessary action
                            if any evidence of persecution were to come to his attention. President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> had asked how he could stop incidents of
                            violence erupting between local political groups and had said that all
                            he could do was say that this sort of thing was not good for Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary intervened to say that the most disturbing aspect of the
                            matter was that the incidents occurring were not just spontaneous
                            eruptions of violence but rather violence arising as a result of
                            intimidation. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>
                            responded, saying this was not true. He said that Keyes Beech, for
                            example, is only reporting the opposition side of the story. Keyes Beech
                            had been talking too much to Democratic Party vice presidential
                            candidate <persName>Chang</persName>. The latter’s tactics, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> emphasized, were wrong
                            and were only helping the Communists. Moreover, the Catholic Bishop in
                            Korea, Bishop Ro, had actively and openly taken part in the electoral
                            campaign. The Protestants in Korea had not taken such a role according
                            to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>. He believed
                                <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0638"/>that Keyes Beech had talked
                            too much to Bishop Ro as well. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> intervened to say that he, of course, was not
                            basing his opinions solely on what one writer had to say about the
                            situation. However, this appeared to be the worst election in the
                            Republic’s history and one marred by widespread violence and charges of
                            irregularities. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>
                            agreed that this election had been the worst in the history of the
                            Republic and he said he could not understand how it had happened.
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName>, he said, is the only man who can
                            hold things together in Korea and any young country needs a strong man
                            to hold things together. At this point Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said he would like to digress on
                            several aspects of the electoral situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary intervened to say that he wanted Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> to understand that we fully
                            appreciate the domestic nature of this problem but we are concerned with
                            the repercussions flowing from the manner in which the elections
                            apparently were conducted, particularly in terms of their impact on
                            public opinion here and in the Congress. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> emphasized that he and President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> lean heavily on the judgment of the
                            Secretary and of this Government and that the Republic of Korea would
                            always try to work fully with the United States.</p>

                            While we have not yet fully evaluated election proceedings, there is
                            growing evidence that <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss>-administration
                            employed on wide scale various coercive devices to ensure landslide
                            victory. Reaction of many Koreans likely to be one of intensifying
                            though submerged discontent with <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> and
                            administration, and Koreans will be highly sensitive to indications of
                            US Govt’s attitude on elections. Any actions we take which lend
                            themselves in interpretation of denoting US approval or indifference to
                            conduct of elections likely to bewilder and engender resentment among
                            many Koreans and might encourage Govt to feel it could take further
                            repressive actions with impunity.</p>
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0639"/>
                        <p>Obviously US must in circumstances avoid statements and actions which
                            could be interpreted as indications of US approval or indifference, but
                            until thorough-going analysis of elections completed and matter
                            considered further here and in Washington obviously premature to attempt
                            recommend exact course of action to be followed by US.</p>
                        <p>We nevertheless recommend that there be delay in announcements that any
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans or major program decisions
                            at least during next two or more weeks which, coming so soon after
                            elections, might be regarded as indicators of US reaction to elections.
                            Certainly <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss> administration will be
                            seeking to convey to Korean public impression that US is not unfavorable
                            to these elections. For same reasons, we believe that dedication
                            Chung-ju fertilizer plant should be postponed until at least mid-April
                            so as to separate event from elections. Such would have adverse economic
                            effects but they might reduce any possibility of US appearing, or being
                            made to appear, as condoning handling of Korean elections.</p>
                        <p>Embassy believes that opportunities should be seized by US official and
                            unofficial spokesmen to comment constructively and express concern in
                            press, etc. regarding elections. In this connection, we consider <gloss
                                target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s statement to press March 14<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d292fn1">Telegram 696 to Seoul, March 14, contained
                                the text of Lincoln White’s statement on March 14. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 795B.00/3–1460)</note> useful and
                            balanced. Meanwhile we can expect that US press and perhaps
                            Congressional and other US comments will (and should) supply ominous
                            warning to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> of trends in American
                            opinion and, played up here in local non-<gloss target="#t_LP1"
                                >LP</gloss> press, will help show Korean people at this critical
                            juncture that US is concerned with fate of democracy in Korea. Moreover,
                            any evidence of US concern and of possible rethinking of policies may
                            have sobering, salutary impact on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            and even upon positions it may take in international field.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing relates to immediate situation and to posture we planning to
                            take in face of it. Looking beyond, however, we believe present
                            political picture (in which elections may be regarded as merely the
                            latest in a series of repressive measures going back over a year) likely
                            deteriorate further in terms of political stability. Although a tactical
                            easing of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government pressure likely
                            in the immediate post-election period, we do not believe this will
                            represent basic deviation from present Liberal Party determination
                            maintain absolute control of political scene at all costs. If we define
                            basis US objectives in Korea as the encouragement of a politically
                            stable and militarily strong nation which is pro-US and anti-Communist
                            in character, then these objectives fundamentally threatened by
                            direction of current trends. Any reversal of these trends <pb n="610"
                                xml:id="pg_610" facs="0640"/>will be a difficult and delicate
                            maneuver requiring time and willingness to assume risk of reaction from
                            those elements of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> whose equities
                            will be affected. Alternative, however, is to stand by and watch while
                            Korean political scene may further corrode, while Korea’s international
                            standing is compromised, while resentment mounts, and while US prestige
                            and recognized authority may become target of a hostile public.</p>
                        <p>Before submitting any recommendations on how to meet this situation, we

                            stand against these trends and we undertook to submit recommendations on
                            how this situation might best be met.</p>
                        <p>Before making specific recommendations, we wish first to highlight
                            certain precepts and principles which we believe should serve as
                            guidelines to any actions we take in helping prevent further dangerous
                            erosion in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> domestic and
                            international positions.</p>
                        <p>It is our first precept that this cannot be done unless there is full
                            coordinated support from all US agencies concerned and unless we have
                            adequate coordination with Congress. As Washington is aware, <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s tend to feel that State Department
                            positions and pronouncements are not necessarily those of US Government
                            as a whole, and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have developed
                            elaborate and not ineffective means for circumventing Department and of
                            playing one US branch or agency against another. As long as this process
                            is allowed to continue, the weight of our statements and démarches will
                            not be adequately felt here in Seoul. It is therefore important that
                            Washington and US officials in Seoul speak with one voice, enlisting the
                            support of Americans having influence with President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            in conveying US concern and suggesting moves for corrective action.</p>
                        <p>Not only should the US speak with one voice but it should speak with a
                            clear voice. Plain speaking is essential at this time when many Koreans
                            are confused as to where we stand. Although we should for-bear from
                            interference in domestic affairs, this principle should not be carried
                            to point where we fail to give a reasonably clear view of our position
                            and of what we recommend. Fact is, of course, that we bear heavy
                            responsibility for what Korea is today and same will be true of what
                            Korea is tomorrow. Our blood, money, reputation and security are heavily
                            invested in Korea. We have perhaps less reason to be passive observers
                            here than anywhere else and the times call for a more vigorous effort to
                                <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0642"/>convey a clearer
                            understanding of our viewpoint. We agree with Department that it is high
                            time <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> came to understanding how their
                            line of credit in the US is becoming depleted and how their
                            international standing is fading.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, through making our views more clearly known as a US viewpoint,
                            we could hope to encourage Koreans to speak up and rally in support of
                            actions we consider it to be in their own interests to pursue. There is
                            already widespread latent support in Korea for those positions, just as
                            there is widespread dissatisfaction there among government officials,
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military and others regarding
                            (A) Korea’s unrealistic foreign policy, especially toward Japan and (B)
                            coercively–administration measures to retain power at any cost. While
                            Koreans by and large are straining to learn what the US proposes to do
                            and while we should convey a clearer understanding of our viewpoint, it
                            nevertheless is up to the Koreans to take the initiative and to carry
                            through with the necessary actions. Our “solutions” cannot be imposed on
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, this Embassy is opposed to economic sanctions or moves to cut
                            back the military assistance program. This might cause irreparable
                            damages to long-term economic and military programs serving basic US
                            interests. It might also injure innocent parties, not only the Korean
                            people, and cause opinion here to turn against the US. It would invite
                            counter-measures by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> leading to
                            harsh antagonistic atmosphere where the kind of remedial measures we
                            have in mind might have little chance of gaining acceptance. This is not
                            to argue against cutting back on certain programs such as our support of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> police and the office of public
                            information, which are making use of US funds in a way damaging to US
                            interests as in the last elections, or against a general tightening up
                            of our aid administration to ensure program is not misused for political
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>In line with this precept, we question wisdom delaying cotton,
                            fertilizer, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> and machinery
                            procurement as suggested <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                                724.<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">See <ref target="#d292fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 292</ref>.</note> These delays would not get at
                            basic political problem and might adversely affect our aid program
                            objectives and penalize ordinary Koreans whom we are trying to help. We
                            therefore urge Washington proceed with these program actions in normal
                            manner. Further, we would not recommend delay in approval first quarter
                            counterpart allotment to military budget, which is overdue. Nor, as a
                            fifth precept, do we recommend tactic of maintaining a cold, aloof
                            attitude towards <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officialdom in
                            order to express our displeasure. This would also create a bad
                            atmosphere for pursuing corrective actions we have in mind, would weaken
                            contacts at time when contacts should be firmest, and is in any <pb
                                n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0643"/>event a rather ineffective and
                            self-demeaning approach. At same time, however, as stated in the first
                            paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, we believe we
                            should avoid as far as feasible doing or saying anything that could be
                            interpreted by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, or be made by
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to appear, that we endorse
                            measures we obviously do not.</p>
                        <p>As a sixth precept, we believe we should avoid blundering into the
                            pitfall of making threats and then having our bluff called. We must be
                            prepared to follow through and make good on any threatened action. This
                            has not always been the case heretofore, and has contributed to an
                            impression that our warnings can be ignored.</p>
                        <p>As a final precept we wish to repeat what was said in <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> regarding a probable tactical
                            easing by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> of certain
                            repressive measures in the immediate post-election period. We do not
                            believe such an easing will represent any fundamental deviation unless
                            concerted action is taken to strike at basic ills in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> picture. This is not to deny the
                            importance of encouraging and applauding corrective actions taken by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s but to point to the need for
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s coming to understand that
                            current remedial measures fall far short of what we regard as necessary.
                            Certainly on domestic side, recent firing of Home Minister and various
                            police chiefs is inadequate.</p>
                        <p>Against background of these general precepts and principles and within
                            context of current US policies, specific Country Team recommendations
                            will be made. These now under active consideration and will probably be
                            wired in by mid-April.<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">On April 6 the
                                Department of State responded in telegrams 783 and 784 by urging the

                                telegram 794 from Seoul. Department officials wanted Embassy

                                from the rioting at Masan was probably higher than authorities had
                                indicated. The Embassy noted that the government had backed away
                                from allegations that the riots were Communist-inspired, and that
                                President <persName>Rhee</persName> had issued a statement in which

                            and sequence events. After short memorial services
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s body returned Masan provincial hospital

                            body for conveyance to Seoul. When refused, crowd moved through city
                            streets toward local police station, snowballing in strength as it
                            moved; reported to have reached strength of 10,000 or more and to have
                            consisted largely of adults by 2130 hours. Crowd shouted “Death to

                            on police and one grenade thrown by crowd wounded estimated eleven

                            Chief actually severely beaten by demonstrators.) By 2130 hours crowd
                            was out of hand, throwing bamboo spears, overturning police vehicles and

                            demonstrations when students took lead and adults stood by. Police
                            retired before rioters and avoided firing for some time. Eventually they
                            did fire 200–500 rounds and succeeded in dispersing crowd. Since only
                            one demonstrator reported killed and only <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615"

                            been firing to intimidate and not for effect. Although <gloss

                            to use the troops was granted. (Telegram 878 from Seoul; Department of

                            also reported that demonstrations had spread to Taegu and Kwangju.

                        <p>President tired, somewhat nervous and shocked by crisis but mind
                            functioning as well as usual. When I opened by expressing my sorrow at
                            tragic events of today he agreed but his following remarks confirmed he
                            is substantially out of touch with realities of present situation and
                            wrong in his assessment of causes, nature and probable consequences of
                            uprisings. He assured me that troubles fomented by small group
                            masterminded by subversives and disorder had now been thoroughly
                            scotched by firm measures taken this afternoon with no likelihood
                            recurrence. When I expressed disagreement and outlined evidence that
                            manifestations were spontaneous upwelling of deeply held feelings of
                            large group representative Korean people, he voiced his certainty that
                                <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0651"/>people were not alienated
                            from him and that he had done right thing in approving drastic action to
                            control mobs when situation got out of hand. He condemned Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName> in bitter terms,
                            along with secondary <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> leaders, as
                            fomenters and abettors of uprising. He refrained from calling them
                            subversives but indicated they were perhaps unwittingly in league with
                            unidentified subversive ringleaders who had planned entire movement.
                            President said he was grieved over death of students killed today but
                            had no idea of numbers involved until I gave him Embassy estimate based
                            on late canvass of hospitals and newspapers of probably 21 dead and at
                            least 27 critically wounded.</p>
                        <p>Ministers pointed to destruction of anti-Communist center, destruction of
                            2 newspaper buildings, attacks on two broadcasting stations and strong
                            mob action directed at presidential palace and Home Ministry as evidence
                            Communist direction.</p>
                        <p>My objectives were (1) prevent bloodshed incident to troops taking over
                            administration of martial law in Seoul tonight, (2) dissuade President
                            from taking punitive action against leaders Democratic Party and any
                            drastic punishment of student demonstrators, (3) convince him of
                            authentic nature of protest by people and necessity for taking positive
                            action to meet in some measure their complaints, (4) demonstrate that
                            Communist participation not now present but real danger of Communist
                            exploitation of current situation which still explosive, if prompt
                            remedial action not taken, (5) remind him of our <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> responsibility, which gave US vital interest in
                            maintenance of secure and stable operating base, which now jeopardized,
                            and (6) bring him to accept undoubted fact that widespread and gross
                            frauds and police coercion in March 15 election is principal source of
                            people’s disaffection. I broached all these subjects in most restrained
                            and conciliatory nature I could consonant with nature of
                            representations. I believe I had some limited measure of success in
                            making President at least temporarily aware of depth of challenge and
                            the consequent threat to his government and the country. He professed
                            ignorance of election fraud allegations saying he could not believe that
                            his trusted Ministers such as Hong and <persName>Kim</persName> could
                            have lied to him or concealed such a bad situation from him. I was able
                            to get limited admissions from <persName>Kim</persName> and Hong that
                            appreciable election irregularities had occurred. This seemed visibly to
                            shake the President although they assured him that in their view frauds
                            were not so bad as to have affected the outcome of the election. Hong,
                            by stating that at least theoretical possibility existed that Supreme
                            Court could declare election null and void, gave me opening to tell
                            President that in my view any official action setting aside the election
                            and calling for new election for President would do more to relieve
                            immediate situation than anything else.</p>

                        <p>I urged President to issue personally recorded broadcast message to
                            Korean people which would restore confidence in him by his expressing
                            regret at recent occurrences, sympathy with legitimate aspirations of
                            people and assurance that government would seek to redress rightful
                            grievances. President said he would consider recommendation.<note n="2"

                                issued a statement in which he noted that the previous day’s
                                demonstrations had been a shock to him. It was too soon, he felt, to
                                discuss causes or to fix blame. Rather, he called for a restoration
                                of order and promised that those who were guilty would be punished
                                and those with legitimate grievances could be certain of redress.

                        <p>President said he had affection for students and would not want to see
                            them shot. President, <persName>Kim</persName> and Hong all expressed
                            confidence that 15th <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Division moving
                            in tonight could and would control situation without resort to firearms.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> assured me that officers were trained and
                            instructed to go to greatest lengths to control situation without
                            shooting. President said he recognized inadvisability of taking action
                            against <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> leaders or ordinary
                            demonstrators and gave me grounds for hope that government will show
                            moderation in these respects.</p>
                        <p>I told President I had instructions from Washington which referred to our
                            deep concern at some of the basic issues which required attention, but
                            would defer a meeting with him on this fundamental subject in view of
                            the lateness of the hour and his preoccupation with the crisis. He
                            thanked me, said he wanted to talk with me again on the subject and
                            indicated he was glad I had come. I believe I retained his confidence
                            and good will.</p>
                        <p>On balance I think visit did some good at least in that it had limited
                            informational and warning effect on President, put Cabinet on defensive
                            as to election practices, highlighted our immediate concern from
                            security standpoint and possibly influenced government to show some
                            moderation and restraint in dealing with immediate aftermath of today’s
                            events. However, I saw no evidence of recognition of basic issues or any
                            disposition or capability to come up with answers to them.<note n="3"

                            AUGUSTA</p>
                        <p>The Secretary telephoned the President with regard to several
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Korea</hi>. The Secretary referred to the serious
                            situation in Korea with riots in most of the major cities and the
                            declaration of martial law. The Secretary said this has all come about
                            as a protest against <persName>Rhee</persName>’s conduct of the
                            elections and his suppression of critics of the elections. The Secretary
                            said he is seeing the Korean Ambassador this afternoon and plans to hand
                            him a very stiff aide-mémoire;<note n="1" xml:id="d301fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d302">Document 302</ref>.</note> that depending on how
                            things develop, it might be desirable for the President to communicate
                            with <persName>Rhee</persName> in a day or two. The President said we
                            just have to get tough with <persName>Rhee</persName> and tell him that
                            we fought for the freedom of South Korea and that unless
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> permits free elections and the people are
                            given the right to vote, there is just no sense in our being in Korea.
                            The Secretary said that while we are technically interfering with the
                            internal affairs of Korea, there are special justifications in this
                            case. The President agreed and said it was at
                            <persName>Rhee</persName>’s insistence that we have kept troops there to
                            defend him. The Secretary said the note he plans to hand the Korean
                            Ambassador is pretty rough, but the Secretary said he didn’t see that we
                            had any choice, and the President agreed that was right. The Secretary
                            said our Ambassador thinks nothing but a new election, at least for the
                            Vice President, would save the situation. The President said that the
                            Secretary should tell our Ambassador to say this to
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>.</p>

                        <p>848. Your 872.<note n="1" xml:id="d302fn1">In telegram 872 from Seoul,
                                April 18, the Embassy proposed several revisions in the aide-mémoire
                                that the Department instructed the Ambassador to present to
                                President <persName>Rhee</persName> to express U.S. concern over the
                                impact of the March 15 elections. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.) The
                                text of that aide-mémoire was transmitted to Seoul in telegram 840,
                                April 15, and was similar but not as pointed or urgent as the
                                revised aide-mémoire transmitted on April 19 in telegram 848. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 795B.00/4–1560) See Supplement. The
                                initial aide-mémoire was overtaken by the events of April 19 before
                                it could be delivered. In telegram 879 from Seoul, sent at 4 p.m.
                                April 19, <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> urged

                                buildings in flames, the Ambassador did not know when he would get a
                                chance to deliver a similar note to President

                            which follows:</p>
                        <p>“The United States Government is most seriously concerned at (a) numerous
                            unprejudiced reports of the undemocratic manner in which the March 15
                            elections and preparations therefor were carried out, and with (b) the
                            resulting aftermath of riots and acts of violence in which a number of
                            deaths have occurred.</p>
                        <p>Although these matters are of primary concern to the Government of the
                            Republic of Korea, this Government feels itself obliged to take
                            cognizance of them as the principal sponsor of the Republic of Korea as
                            an applicant for United Nations membership and because, in the eyes of
                            the world, the United States is associated with Korea as a close friend
                            and ally. The United States believes that the demonstrations are a
                            reflection of popular anger and that the current situation, if not
                            corrected so as to restore public confidence, could easily provide a
                            fertile ground for Communist manipulation.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government also feels obliged to take cognizance of
                            these matters in view of its responsibilities toward maintaining
                            security in Korea and the western Pacific area generally. The stability
                            and security of the Republic of Korea likewise appear to have been
                            compromised through involvement of the police and military in politics.
                            This could seriously detract from their efficiency, alienate the public
                            from law enforcement agencies, and contribute to an atmosphere
                            exploitable by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>This Government considers it necessary to draw the attention of the
                            Government of the Republic of Korea to the seriousness of the
                            international <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0655"/>repercussions
                            which must be anticipated, and many of which have already been
                            manifested, as a result of the conduct of the March 15 elections and the
                            subsequent riots and acts of violence. Among these are: <list>

                        <p>The United States Government, therefore, believes that the interests of
                            Korea will be served if the Government of the Republic of Korea takes
                            action to counteract effectively the adverse developments noted above.
                            The United States Government is convinced that such action should be
                            aimed at restoring confidence in the intention of the Government of the
                            Republic of Korea to protect democratic rights of freedom of speech, of
                            assembly, and of the press; to preserve the secrecy of the ballot; and
                            to prevent unfair discrimination against political opponents of a party
                            in power. This Government does not consider that martial law provides a
                            solution to the present situation in Korea. There are, however, certain
                            actions which this Government believes the Government of the Republic of
                            Korea might well consider taking: <list>

                                    elections, it is important that the Government of the Republic
                                    of Korea take actions, such as those following, which would
                                    serve to counter these allegations and renew the people’s
                                    confidence in the fact that the Government of the Republic of
                                    Korea genuinely endorses a democratic two-party system: <list>

                            Ambassador Yang could well imagine, we were greatly distressed by the
                            most serious trend of events in Korea. He stated that he had prepared an
                            aide-mémoire expressing our views as regards the situation in Korea and
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> had
                            been instructed to deliver an identical aide-mémoire to President

                            so. The Secretary then read with emphasis the aide-mémoire transmitted
                            by the Department’s telegram 848 of April 19.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d303fn1"><ref target="#d302">Document 302</ref>.</note> In
                            the course of reading the aide-mémoire, the Secretary pointed out that
                            the American public and Congress had already questioned the propriety of
                            the President visiting the Republic of Korea this summer. The Secretary
                            concluded, saying that as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> realized we would not be delivering an aide-mémoire
                            of this nature unless we were most seriously concerned by the situation
                            in Korea and that we were doing so as a close friend and ally of the
                            Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> stated that some
                            of the points raised by the Secretary were already being taken care of
                            by the Korean Government. The Home Minister had been replaced. A new
                            Chief of Police as well as a new Director of <gloss target="#t_OPI1"
                                >OPI</gloss> had been installed and the Mayor of Seoul had been
                            replaced. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said he
                            was sure that the Secretary had noted <gloss target="#t_UPI1"
                                >UPI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> reports
                            indicating that the Korean police had exercised restraint in dealing
                            with the demonstrators. The Secretary pointed out, however, that many
                            people had been killed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> responded saying that many of the students had
                            acquired firearms which they were using and which forced the police to
                            fire to protect themselves. The student demonstrators in Seoul, he said,
                            were operating as <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0658"/>mobs and
                            engaging in irresponsible acts of violence. The mobs have burned the <hi
                                rend="italic">Kyonghyang Sinmun</hi> newspaper building as well as
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss> and anti-Communist league
                            buildings. The latter, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> said, had nothing to do with politics. The mobs, he
                            said, had even tried to destroy General <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName>’s statue.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> continued, saying
                            that the Korean Government had found leaflets distributed by the mobs
                            calling for the withdrawal of United States and United Nations troops
                            from Korea. The mobs had also thrown stones indiscriminately through
                            shop windows. All these actions, Ambassador Yang said, had nothing to do
                            with the political situation. It was a case, he said, of mob psychology
                            prevailing. President <persName>Rhee</persName>, he said, agreed with
                            what the Secretary had had to say and was doing everything in his power
                            to correct the situation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the allegations that the presidential elections had been
                            “rigged”, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said
                            that he had no proof one way or the other, nor was he in a position to
                            say whether the ballot boxes had been stuffed or other fraudulent
                            practices employed. He emphasized that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> would have been elected in any event and
                            recalled that Dr. <persName>Cho</persName> had said the same thing to
                            him while in the hospital at Washington and that Dr.
                                <persName>Cho</persName> did not consider that he had a chance in
                            running against President <persName>Rhee</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said that he not
                            only would send the aide-mémoire to his Government but that he would
                            express his own feelings as well since the situation deeply concerns the
                            Korean people. He said that he had sent a message to Korea April 18 for
                            publication in the Korean press appealing to the Korean people to let
                            law and order prevail and to permit an investigation to be made of the
                            recent elections. He said that the Democratic Party had filed a petition
                            with the Supreme Court to declare the March 15 elections null and void.
                            The Supreme Court, he said, would undertake an investigation and in the
                            process would likely open the ballot boxes and recount the ballots cast.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> said that he was
                            urging the Korean people to be “good sports” and let law and order
                            determine whether any fraudulent acts were employed in the recent
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1"
                                >Yang</persName> that we deplore violence in any form. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> stated that President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> also deplores resort to violence. He said
                            the Secretary could be sure something can and will be done to rectify
                            the situation in Korea. He emphasized that the Communists look for
                            trouble spots to infiltrate and exploit. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> pointed out that Pyongyang was
                            broadcasting that north Korea was prepared to come to the help of the
                            demonstrators. The Secretary intervened to say that the Korean
                            Government <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0659"/>should not give the
                            Communists an excuse or an opportunity to infiltrate or exploit the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> concluded, stating
                            that the exchange of views had been helpful and, in reference to the
                            President’s visit, stated that he thought this would be very helpful and
                            would be welcomed by all Koreans regardless of political
                                affiliation.<note n="2" xml:id="d303fn2">Following the Secretary’s
                                meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>,
                                the Department of State issued a statement that noted that the
                                purpose of the meeting was to impress upon the Ambassador the
                                growing concern of the United States over continuing public unrest
                                and acts of violence in Korea. “Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> was informed that this
                                Government believes that the demonstrations in Korea are a
                                reflection of popular dissatisfaction over the conduct of the recent
                                elections and repressive measures unsuited to a free democracy.”

                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> this morning, also attended by
                            Acting <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and <gloss

                            aide-mémoire. Meeting was unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Evidently anticipating nature of my mission, President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> launched immediately forth with expression
                            of surprise and concern over Washington’s reaction to events of past
                            three days, reactions which he termed “the opposite” of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. When I interposed that our
                            statements and all other actions were based upon deep friendship and
                            regard for Korea, President commented that “sometimes good will is
                            misused and creates a difficult situation.”</p>
                        <p>President’s principal theme was that disorders in Korea not a reflection
                            of popular dissatisfaction but rather the handiwork of Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName>, supported by
                            Catholic Bishop Ro, who was seeking to use Catholic Church influence for
                            advancing Chang’s political ambitions. He was at pains not to say that
                            this was a Catholic Church <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0660"
                            />conspiracy, emphasizing that Catholics continually express friendship
                            and support for government but rather Chang’s using his membership in
                            Catholic Church for trying to stir up students and others in revolt
                            against constituted authority. He further alleged that, with his term of
                            office rapidly running out, <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                Myon</persName> had been driven to even more desperate political
                            measures than he had been employing previously. He insisted that
                            Catholic Church membership generally, including Apostolic Delegate
                            Lambertini and Bishop Quinlan, is opposed to Vice President’s so-called
                            political maneuvering. He regretted he said that he had not told me
                            about all this before.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> continued that Washington’s version
                            of Korean developments is entirely at odds with the facts. If Washington
                            continues to base its policy on such a failure to understand true facts
                            “it will all be a terrible mess” and Korean people will not know what to
                            do. He continued: “Mr. Ambassador, you can save us if you realize these
                            facts and help calm things down.” He also complained that US newspapers
                            are agitating matters, making them worse, that guileless youth of Korea
                            are being misled by <persName>Chang</persName> and others and that it
                            would now take long, long time to establish peace and order. He said
                            time would be required to get all the evidence together adequately to
                            prove the “facts” about Chang’s conspiracy.</p>
                        <p>I told President <persName>Rhee</persName> that I was always receptive to
                            hearing his side of the story and having his information and
                            interpretation. However, I could not agree that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName> is or has been conspiring
                            against government. From all our many US sources of information, we know
                            him to be loyal leader of loyal opposition; that we do not believe for
                            one minute that he is the fomenter of this nation-wide movement which is
                            spontaneous, deriving from the grass roots and based on justifiable
                            grievances. Nor do we believe that <persName>Chang</persName> is kind of
                            man who could fire up nation this way, any more than we believe him to
                            be anything but a full respecter of law and order.</p>
                        <p>I continued that there have been some bad abuses in Korea which have
                            created general popular anger and that demonstrations are a bona fide
                            expression of people’s outrage. Because President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> was growing more and more agitated I
                            hastened to interpose that these manifestations of anger were not, I
                            believed, directed against him who was regarded as saviour of his
                            country, but there is widespread feeling that he does not know all that
                            is going on and that important facts are being withheld from him.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> retorted with vehemence that I seemed
                            to place greater confidence in opponents of his government than in his
                            government, that this would make it difficult for him to deal with
                            me.</p>
                        <p>I interrupted to say that it was quite the contrary; I wished to talk
                            things over with him, to have his views and confidence and to help him
                                <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0661"/>cope with situation.
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName>, mollified, said that with US help
                            the situation could be tranquilized. He said he would show US all the
                            evidence when it was assembled of where the true cause lay, but that if
                            I did not believe what he said, then “where do we go?”</p>
                        <p>I replied that we sought to be fair-minded and certainly thought we were;
                            we wanted to hear whatever evidence of conspiracy President had and we
                            did not seek to pressure him. However, we believe our assessment of
                            situation to be correct and believe that steps could be taken and must
                            be taken by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to restore full
                            support of populace for government.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName>’s recent meeting with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> and said that I was under
                            instructions to deliver an aide-mémoire which had already been given
                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>. I asked permission to
                            read aide-mémoire.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> replied that he would like to see it
                            except that “it is so far away from the truth.” President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> said that few people in the State
                            Department had any real understanding of Far East situation, and that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> is newcomer to
                            this field and too pro-Japanese, that for many years State Department
                            had opposed him when he warned US people of growing Japanese threat and,
                            even though that threat had erupted into war, there was still tendency
                            in State Department to trust Japanese more than Koreans.</p>
                        <p>(President <persName>Rhee</persName> repeated these charges against State
                            Department in three subsequent parts of conversation.) I dismissed this
                            latter charge as groundless. I then strongly emphasized to
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> two points: (1) That all US Government
                            agencies are agreed in their assessment of Korean problem and of
                            remedial steps needed immediately to be taken, (2) that US and Korea
                            have common understanding of Communist threat and basic steps to meet
                            that threat. With <persName>Rhee</persName>’s permission, I then read
                            full text of aide-mémoire slowly (but omitting last paragraphs spelling
                            out specific measures which might be taken, merely referring to them in
                            general. I felt that reference to specific measures would only lead to
                            discussions obscuring main points and might leave him with impression
                            that his government’s taking only certain limited steps would
                            suffice).</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> listened impassively, though acting
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Choi snorted occasionally,
                            and I quickly followed up with another expression of our friendship and
                            desire to cooperate with President <persName>Rhee</persName>. I said I
                            continued to be disturbed that he might not be adequately informed by
                            his advisors. I said I hoped he would accept aide-mémoire in friendly
                            cooperative spirit in which it was given, that we were not dictating but
                            rather counseling a close ally and fellow democracy.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> inquired what he could now do to make
                            it “easier for the State Department.” I rejoined that this was not an
                            expression of <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0662"/>State Department
                            thinking but rather of US Government thinking. Question was what could
                            be done expeditiously by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to
                            relieve dangerous pressures which are building up without resort to
                            repressive measures. Basic causes were way these last elections
                            conducted and way that police involved in politics and in their
                            employment harsh repressive measures to point where they now hated by
                            people. I said that if <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> failed to
                            understand these to be basic causes and grievances and to act
                            accordingly then situation would explode; otherwise it could be calmed
                            down and people’s confidence restored in government.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> stated that, given time, he would be
                            able to prove to US the whole story behind <persName>Chang</persName>’s
                            conspiracy and we will see through the measures to be taken by his
                            government that all will be cleared up.</p>
                        <p><persName>Rhee</persName> enjoined that I inform President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> how sorry he was about this
                            “unexpected disturbance” and that everything would be done to settle it
                            long before President came here on visit so warmly anticipated by <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people. He was sorry that some school
                            boys seemed to be doing everything they could to spoil President
                            Eisenhower’s visit.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was sure he would do everything necessary to permit
                            visit to take place and that this would necessarily include taking steps
                            to remove basic causes of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            instability. I said l had right along recommended President Eisenhower’s
                            visit and I sincerely trusted there would be no reason for President
                            having to change his plans. That would be most unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> said that he would see to it that
                            there were no “untoward incidents” which might mar visit. I responded
                            that it wasn’t an incident that might occur during visit which presented
                            problem but whether or not basic grievances in this nation had been
                            redressed in way which would permit visit.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that it would be helpful if aide-mémoire could be kept strictly
                            confidential. Minister Choi then criticized State Department

                                <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName>’s visit to receive
                            aide-mémoire. Choi claimed that US had in effect released “gist” of
                            aide-mémoire to which I took decided exception. Choi also complained
                            that State Department statement was issued even before <gloss
                                target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> had received report of Yang’s
                            conversation with Secretary. Choi went on to deliver what appeared to be
                            carefully planned reprimand to Embassy regarding the press release
                            issued while the demonstration was at its height.<note n="3"

                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> was silent during exchange between
                            Choi and me regarding proprieties of statement, but my concluding
                            statement that <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0663"/>our release had
                            not interfered with restoration of law and order and might have assisted
                            it went without effective challenge even from Choi. I emphasized that
                            our statement was intended to be helpful to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss>, that it deplored resort to violence, that it seemed
                            to have had a stabilizing effect, that I had carefully read statement to
                            senior minister (Defense Minister) who was with President in beleaguered
                            Presidential palace at time of issuance and that this senior minister
                            had signified our statement would be useful. Choi weakly replied,
                            without being specific, that translation of phrase into Korean of
                            “justifiable grievances” twisted press statement in way “which was
                            surprising and embarrassing” to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                            >ROKG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Since Choi also indicated his view that our aide-mémoire had been
                            delivered to <persName corresp="#p_YYC1">Yang</persName> precipitately
                            in moment of stress, I replied that this aide-mémoire had been long in
                            preparation and would have been delivered anyway regardless of April 19
                            events. Latter merely underscored tenability of points made in
                            aide-mémoire. President <persName>Rhee</persName> returned to his
                            allegation of State Department naiveté and concluded with request that
                            we re-examine the “facts” and that for his part he would present “true
                            facts” as soon as they could be assembled.</p>
                        <p>He indicated he wished to see me again. We left on ostensibly amicable
                            note though I have no doubt but that my visit has placed some strain,
                            which may be temporary, on our personal relations.</p>

                            at State Council to stress extreme seriousness of situation (at least
                            50,000 demonstrators marching toward center of city), urged that

                            President immediately receive delegation of students and that President
                            issue statement relating to question of holding new elections; that
                            President would certainly wish to consider his future political role.
                            Ambassador stressed his willingness to call on President soonest.
                            Minister <persName>Kim</persName> said “I need your help” to convince
                            President, but would call me back as soon as he could get President’s
                            permission for me to come.</p>
                        <p>At 0920 Ambassador told General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1"

                            re-establish public order.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> observed that he had just come from
                            meeting with group student representatives. He described them as being
                            good young men who eager do right thing, and who simply want know truth.
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> had told them it only on evening
                            April 25 that he had learned of illegal way in which March 15 election
                            conducted. He further told them he will do whatever people want of him,
                            and that he will thus serve people as had in past. He said he asked
                            students tell him what they wanted him do and they had criticised
                            elections. President <persName>Rhee</persName> told them he had decided
                            elections must be corrected, and that he would accomplish this.</p>

                            emphatically pointed out to President <persName>Rhee</persName> that he
                            considered situation Seoul this day be highly dangerous and explosive
                            and that situation definitely required clear and satisfying statements
                            intent. He asked President <persName>Rhee</persName> if he thought these
                            four points went far enough in direction people’s demands. President
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> said ‘we doing all we can’ and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> repeated, in

                            intent. He went on say that further equivocation and temporizing, he was
                            convinced, would be dangerous in present situation. President responded
                            by repeating that government doing all it could and by suggesting that
                            implementation corrective actions be left them. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> then stated that not only

                            interests as well, and that we were concerned lest government’s actions
                            not be adequate.</p>
                        <p>At this point Minister <persName>Kim</persName> interposed to state
                            firmly that government completely sincere, and would definitely carry
                            out actions above described. Also much needed he went on, was public
                            statement by American Ambassador supporting actions outlined by
                            government, and, to convince Korean people that it, the American
                            Government, believes that Korean Government’s statements are sincere and
                            will be carried out. He thought it of vital importance that name United

                            by saying that he would at once consider this request and would let
                            Minister <persName>Kim</persName> know, but that he believed such
                            statement could be made.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> turned to
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> and eulogized him as true father
                            Korean nation and man who had in lifetime been revered and respected as
                            no other Korean. He said we indeed have viewed President

                            his country and wished, with sympathy and deep understanding to help him
                            preserve his proper and honored place history. He said however that it
                            happens in life that time comes when people believe that elder
                            statesman, having carried so many burdens for so many years, should step
                            away from his responsibilities, retire to position respect, and turn

                            over to younger men. He said that in his opinion this time had come
                            Korea. President <persName>Rhee</persName> replied by stating he deeply
                            appreciated these expressions American concern, and he viewed them as
                            representing America desire help Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> turned to
                            ask if Minister Kim felt that President <persName>Rhee</persName> truly
                            understood mood of population Seoul and mood people now in streets.
                            President <persName>Rhee</persName> observed that in his younger days he

                            one of them. At this point Minister <persName>Kim</persName> interrupted
                            to state he considered time be of great importance, and that United

                                >McConaughy</persName> stated that it commonly felt that national

                            must be completely fair.</p>
                        <p>President <persName>Rhee</persName> responded specifically this point by
                            saying he had already announced that new election would be held fairly,

                            reelections should be held, that the constitution should be amended to
                            provide for a system of cabinet government, and that elections for a new

                            constitutional amendment. (Telegram 984 from Seoul, April 26; Department

                            overwhelming desire of Korean people that he do so and reflected in

                        <p>We are aware there will be many and difficult problems to deal with in

                            establishment of caretaker government. At same time we feel that

                            development broadly based Korean administration dedicated to Free World
                            principles and security objectives and to effective operation genuinely

                            Additionally we believe also that situation holds hope that way can now

                            rapidly restored and an early return to law and order achieved. We would
                            hope every effort would be made by his government to ensure that
                            situation in Korea does not now degenerate into one of internal
                            political discord accompanied by further and possibly more violent
                            demonstrations. Believe this can best be avoided by Ho and his
                            government moving promptly toward holding of new elections which we
                            assume will assure freedom secret ballot and development broadly based

                            could retire to position respect and honor in his country which he so
                            richly deserves on basis long historical record.</p>
                        <p>We would also wish you indicate to General <persName>Song</persName> that

                        <p>We believe it would also be useful if you could talk to university

                            settlement, and stated his views this point would be communicated to

                            I strongly welcomed his views on importance reaching prompt settlement

                            position. I also suggested that such statement indicate his

                            stability. Referring President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                            receptive to my suggestion statement along these lines.</p>
                        <p>In connection my remarks re prompt restoration law and order, I urged

                            now being held responsible by many for many wrongful acts committed by
                            government. I emphasized that such acts mob retribution could only have
                            adverse impact on his efforts maintain law and order and on world
                            opinion toward Korea, and I urged that, if necessary, individuals likely

                            be misconstrued. His manner conveys impression of integrity,
                            deliberation, objectivity, balance, probably somewhat lacking in

                                        corresp="#p_HC4">Huh Chung</persName> had displayed a great
                                    deal of competence in recent negotiations with Japan. Mr.

                                        <persName corresp="#p_HC4">Huh Chung</persName> had shown a
                                    genuine desire to reach an agreement with the Japanese in the
                                    recent negotiations, contrary to the attitude displayed by
                                    President <persName>Rhee</persName>. Continuing, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> said the Korean populace might
                                    be aroused to take further mob action if it feels that reforms
                                    are proceeding too slowly. At present the attitude of the Korean
                                    population is very friendly toward the U.S. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> was of the opinion that the U.S.
                                    Ambassador to Korea handled the situation with great skill. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> then read an extract [<hi

                                    the Korean crisis came with the entry of the U.S. Ambassador
                                    into the palace to interview <persName>Rhee</persName>. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that our Ambassador and
                                    General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1">Magruder</persName> had
                                    been cheered in Korea. The President was not sure that the
                                    applause of the Korean crowd was an unmixed blessing. He said
                                    this applause could easily turn to condemnation as soon as we
                                    did something the crowds did not like. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> agreed that it was
                                    dangerous to allow mobs to have an influence on decisions. The
                                    Vice President asked whether our activities in Korea had made
                                    us, in the minds of the people, responsible for the new Korean
                                    government. The President said we had warned
                                        <persName>Rhee</persName> about the consequences of his
                                    course of action. However, he (the President) was not aware that
                                    we were about to be made responsible in the eyes of the Korean
                                    people for the change in the Korean government. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> did not believe that the Korean
                                    crowds did give us credit for the change in the Korean
                                    government.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss

                            resolution is moving to seize control of situation and in effect is

                            decisively on political plane by announcing date for new presidential

                            regain political initiative before it too late. We unaware any legal or

                        <p>As Embassy points out, present Constitutional amendment schedule runs
                            very close to June 17 Constitutional deadline for announcement
                            presidential elections. (In view unfavorable developments reported your
                            1051, would appear there is no assurance that National Assembly, with
                            obvious vested interests, will in fact approve Constitutional amendment
                            by June 17 or any other date. Moreover the longer this Assembly
                            continues to exist, the more opportunity is given as you suggest for

                            that the course of action being pursued by National Assembly with

                            and elimination corruption, legislative action on such issues as <gloss

                            strengthen his resistance to these influences. We question whether the
                            present Assembly is likely, at least short of motivation which doubtless
                            would have to come from us, to resist temptation to salvage what they
                            can of the <gloss target="#t_LP1">LP</gloss>’s damaged position. It is
                            perhaps asking too much for majority to vote for its own demise–again,
                            short of strong motivation.</p>
                        <p>Somehow <persName corresp="#p_HC4">Huh Chung</persName> must be given
                            clearly to understand that while our stakes are viewed as large in
                            Korea, they are even larger world-wide in relation to Korea, and we have
                            no intention of jeopardizing recent gains made (on the side of heeding
                            popular determination and resulting favorable side-effects) if we can
                            help it. At least in our own minds we must keep actively before us
                            possibility that another explosion, when and if it comes, must require
                            Ne Win-type of interim control, in clear intent to support people’s
                            intent, unless those objectives can be now obtained under more
                            desirable, if more cumbersome, democratic management. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HC4">Huh Chung</persName> should realize in full force
                            that we consider we are on threshold not only of great gains in Korea,

                            concomitant advance in principles which we consider we are defending in
                            having fought in Korea in first place. We are further mindful that gains
                            already made, and those yet to come, are being watched by an attentive,
                            anxious, large, world-wide audience which is aware that we have rights
                            and indeed obligations fully corollary to our heavy responsibilities in
                            Korea, and that we can overlook none of these. At same time we are
                            extremely mindful of importance of avoiding appearance of intervention
                            or indeed of interfering any more than essential with internal dynamism
                            of Korean national life. As a result, exercise of our great
                            responsibility, deeply involved as we are through economic aid, military
                            support and our military presence, requires extremely sensitive and
                            quick adjustment to daily events but with clear concept in mind of what
                            we now have in train and are already partly responsible for.</p>

                            for Dr. <persName>Rhee</persName> and herself. She explained that
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> was under great pressure from friends and
                            former political associates to reenter the political arena, and wanted
                            to remove himself from that strain. (Telegram 1215 from Seoul, May 25;

                            imperative that the Rhees leave Korea as quickly as possible, in that
                            their presence in the country was unsettling and destabilizing.

                            deal of muckraking was going on and purges may be in preparation. A

                            but apparently it did not presage any unusual development such as an

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the Republic of

                            June 10. He believed the constitution would be adopted. Elections could
                            be held 45 days after adoption of the constitution. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt that we must wait until the
                            elections had taken place to form a firm idea of the political future in
                            Korea. The caretaker government was cooperating with us, the situation
                            in the country was reasonably good, and the President’s visit should be
                            a good one, especially if the Assembly acts on the constitution first.
                            The President said that except for his visit to Taiwan, his trip
                            appeared to be an adventure into the unknown.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> asked whether any change
                            in U.S. economic assistance to Korea was contemplated. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said no dramatic change was
                            contemplated. There would be a reduction of about $10 million in
                            economic aid in next year’s program; last year the reduction amounted to
                            $22 million. A change in the exchange rate would permit a larger
                            reduction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought
                            that the publicity given certain scandals in the Korean Government had
                            led some observers to conclude that we were providing too much aid to
                            Korea. While our aid was under investigation, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> was of the opinion that the
                            projects for which assistance was provided were sound and worthwhile
                            projects, beneficial to the country, even though some of them were used
                            for political purposes in rewarding <persName>Rhee</persName>’s
                            adherents.</p>
                        <p>The President said that during the last few months there had been an
                            epidemic of difficulties–Cuba, Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Turkey, and
                            Indonesia. It was discouraging to try to help various countries achieve
                            stability and then find that the countries which received the most
                            assistance became the most unstable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> believed that education and improvement in the
                            standard of living would not necessarily produce conservatism or
                            stability.</p>

                        <p>1160. For Ambassador from <persName>Parsons</persName>. In anticipation
                            Assembly approval Constitutional amendment, believe it would be useful
                            to develop concept of role US Govt can most usefully play in ensuring
                            that aspirations of April 19 movement, free world interests, and our own
                            national interest best served. Views which follow purely exploratory to
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>We believe, as does Embassy, that experiment with parliamentary
                            government should be tried, in view not only of apparent sentiment
                            Korean <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"/>people but also of lack
                            clear identification leadership talent at present time. Parliamentary
                            system may well bring leaders to fore, and offers opportunity for some
                            reshuffling. At same time political maneuverings in National Assembly
                            will provide excellent means for US to observe and possibly to influence
                            course of Korean development for immediate future. Nevertheless
                            parliamentary system has obvious handicaps: (1) risk of unstable and
                            shifting coalition government, depending upon purchasable support of
                            considerable number Assembly members, without clear majority any one
                            political group; (2) at opposite extreme, possible degeneration into
                            one-party system and consequent renewed danger corruption and abuses
                            liberty.</p>
                        <p>Short-run success parliamentary government from viewpoint US objectives
                            and Korean stability depends in large measure upon existence organized
                            moderately-oriented majority in Assembly, with access to experienced
                            politicians and technicians for effective conduct government. This
                            particularly true in light absence expected one-year moratorium on
                            non-confidence votes. Only group which can provide at least core of such
                            majority at present is Democratic Party. Accordingly we should
                            discreetly support <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> in election
                            campaign in hope ensuring <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> majority,

                            widespread rumor of US intervention. On other hand manifestation now of

                            Korean opinion. Best outcome might be Assembly composed of (1) <gloss

                                >Eisenhower</persName> on the failure of the Summit Conference in
                            Paris in May and his discussions with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei.]</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_HC4">Huh Chung</persName> expressed
                            his appreciation for the President’s exposition and agreed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would not start a large scale
                            global war immediately. He asked the President if he did not think the
                            Communists might not start limited wars, however, in order to discover
                            weak spots.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he thought Khrushchev would refrain from
                            starting small wars that might readily become big wars. He might use
                            some of the satellite countries to fight small wars for him, believing
                            that the risks would be less. Khrushchev probably believes that he has
                            better ways than warfare to achieve his objectives.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister turned to issues between the Republic of Korea and
                            Japan. He said he wanted to make some mention of U.S. policy and
                            attitudes toward Japan. He said that as a Korean who had worked for
                            eight or nine years for normalization of relations with Japan, he feels
                            keen regrets that his efforts have had no results.</p>
                        <p>Ex-President <persName>Rhee</persName> had given him an unexpected
                            appointment last October as the head of the Korean mission to negotiate
                            with the Japanese. He had headed the mission for three or four months.
                            At first he had considerable optimism that he might be able to solve the
                            outstanding problems. Unhappily his enthusiasm and optimism were not
                            well founded. The improvement he had hoped for was not achieved. He had
                            met a number of Japanese people, had done extensive research on the
                            issues, had devoted much effort to the problems of the “peace line”,
                            property restoration and the legal status of Korean residents of Japan.
                            He had concluded that these issues could be settled with the exercise of
                            “good common sense.” However, these did not constitute the fundamental
                            problem in Japan-Korea relations. He had met with Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName>, Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA8">Fujiyama</persName> and others. He had
                            found that the Japanese did not fully understand or appreciate the deep
                            national sentiment of the Korean people on Japanese questions. The
                            Japanese did not take full account of the inevitable hatred and
                            resentment of the Korean people growing out of the years of Japanese
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>Japan has profited from generous United States aid and has grown
                            prosperous despite the fact that it was a defeated nation. With the
                            benefit of American assistance Japan has become one of the most advanced
                            countries. This has given the Japanese an attitude of superiority and
                            they look down on the Koreans. He said these elements are basic factors
                            in the situation. The Prime Minister said he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_KN1">Kishi</persName> that the problem could not be
                            solved until the Japanese understood the national sentiment of the
                            Korean people and made some effort to “soothe” the Korean people. Unless
                            this were done a serious situation would be <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670"
                                facs="0700"/>created. The Prime Minister said that the Japanese
                            instead of trying to help the situation had made it worse by sending
                            Korean residents to Communist North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that when he took over the Government at the end
                            of April, he had hoped to solve the outstanding issues in one or two
                            months. He had discussed the situation repeatedly and at length with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>. He had
                            felt that if the United States could influence Japan to stop sending
                            Koreans to the Communist north, he could resume the negotiations with
                            Japan with prospects of success. The Prime Minister said he had expected
                            and waited for some US action. But the US had failed to act.</p>
                        <p>He said that Japan was claiming that the Koreans had a “free choice of
                            residence.” They are pretending that the repatriation scheme is a
                            humanitarian endeavor. He said, “This is not exactly so.” He said that
                            “free choice” is just a mask used by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>If the United States had shown that it was not fully in accord with the
                            Japanese action, the Japanese program for shipping Koreans to the north
                            would not have been successful. In the beginning of the negotiations
                            when the U.S. expressed objections the agreement was blocked; but when
                            the United States “kept silent” the Japanese were encouraged to reach
                            the Calcutta Agreement of last August<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">On
                                August 13, 1959, an agreement was concluded in Calcutta, India,
                                between the Japanese and North Korean Red Cross societies, providing
                                for a repatriation program to North Korea of those Koreans in Japan
                                who so elected. The agreement was to be implemented under the

                            regime. Even after that, if the United States had exerted its influence
                            on the Japanese, the shipments could have been stopped. Then the
                            situation in Japan would have developed differently. Now the situation
                            has changed and he has little hope of finding a solution. He expressed
                            deep concern. He felt that the Japanese are likely to “turn to a
                            neutralist trend,” if not an actual pro-Communist orientation. Then
                            negotiations between Japan and Korea would become “more difficult.” Also
                            a “non-Communist system” in Asia would become “more difficult to
                            maintain.”</p>
                        <p>He said that if the emphasis which the Department of State has placed on
                            Japan in an effort to bring about stabilization there could instead be
                            placed on a staunch anti-Communist country such as Korea, Free China,
                            Viet Nam or the Philippines, that would be the best way to preserve a
                            strong anti-Communist system in Asia. Korea was strongly anti-Communist
                            “to the last person” and U.S. efforts to further strengthen Korea
                            economically or militarily would be well justified.</p>
                        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0701"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that finally in view of recent developments in
                            Japan, especially the reactions against the Security Treaty, he would
                            like to know if there was any change in the U.S. attitude towards
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that the consequences of adoption of a pro-Communist
                            or even a neutralist policy by Japan would be most serious. He felt that
                            no security system we could set up in the Far East without Japanese
                            participation would work satisfactorily. The military burden that would
                            have to be assumed would be back-breaking. He felt that it must not be
                            allowed to happen and that Japan must and can be saved.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could see some justification in the grievances
                            voiced by the Prime Minister. He expressed regret that the right formula
                            for solving the problems had not yet been found. He felt that a way must
                            be found to cooperate on fundamental matters without waiting for a
                            solution of all outstanding problems. He felt we must all try to prevent
                            the development of an adverse situation in Japan which would call for a
                            far reaching reappraisal.</p>
                        <p>The President recognized the need to help the Republic of Korea to
                            develop economically and otherwise–but not at the expense of Japan. He
                            said that we must all put our minds to the urgent problem of keeping
                            Japan in the right camp. With a population approaching 100 million
                            people and with a high stage of industrial development, Japan by joining
                            up with Communist China even in the economic field alone could place the
                            rest of the countries in the free world alignment in an extremely
                            adverse position.</p>
                        <p>The President thought we should all consult together on the problem since
                            we face a tricky situation in the light of the new elections which
                            presumably will be held soon in Japan. We must not give up trying to
                            make the Japanese recognize the realities of the current situation.</p>
                        <p>He hoped the Japanese could be brought to respect the national attitudes
                            of neighboring countries. He would be glad to have the further views of
                            the Korean Government on this problem which could be expressed either
                            through the Korean Ambassador in Washington or the American Ambassador
                            in Seoul. He added that we did not want to take any action in Japan
                            which would have the effect of driving the Japanese further in the wrong
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he agreed completely. He had not meant to
                            imply that the U.S. should abandon Japan. He said that we should
                            certainly do our best to hold the line in Japan. He assured the
                            President of the Korean intent to cooperate fully with the United States
                            but he could not help but express his deep concern as to the future of
                            Japan. He said that if Japan became pro-Communist or even neutralist it
                            was a life or death matter for Korea. So the Republic of Korea was
                            understandably more concerned than any other country with the <pb
                                n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0702"/>developments in Japan. While
                            not considering it inevitable that the worst would occur, he thought we
                            must be prepared for that.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Prime Minister said he would like to call in the
                            Ministers of Reconstruction and Defense to brief the President on
                            economic assistance and military matters.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that the allotted time was already used up and
                            that a continuation would mean that he would be late. He said he would
                            continue if the Prime Minister requested it, but he would ask that the
                            National Assembly be notified of the delay. He felt that he owed this to
                            the National Assembly. He did not wish to be guilty of a discourtesy to
                            the Speaker and the Members of the National Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister assured the President that he would notify the
                            National Assembly of the delay and that the Assembly would not object.
                            He said that the briefing would be made as short as possible.</p>

                            which threaten such development. In Embassy view however extent our
                            ability influence directly emergence certain individuals to particular
                            positions responsibility or affect configurations power within and
                            between polit parties is decidedly marginal. Moreover extent to which we

                            exert even this limited influence, presents serious dangers not only of
                            evoking adverse criticism of our interference but encouraging polit
                            leadership shift or evade responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Further our experience in Korea suggests that however much particular

                            values of effective representative democracy, they function within a
                            total situation which is uncongenial to their realization. Longer-range
                            polit stability within democratic framework therefore depends
                            essentially upon changes in such aspects of total situation as
                            psychological climate, patterns and values polit behavior, and economic
                            situation as will encourage: A) development of experienced and
                            responsible leadership in Govt and polit parties; B) greater concern for
                            translating realizable <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0705"/>popular
                            aspirations into sound national policies together with higher standards

                        <p>In Embassy view therefore it essential US influence be brought bear more
                            effectively in direction encouraging such changes in total situation. In

                            Koreans particularly younger citizens and Govt officials including

                            our capacity to influence short-term developments is limited. Moreover
                            some Democratic Party leaders, having been told for many years of our

                        <p>At same time we believe that if short-range Korean instability is too

                            so serious, and so basic to Korea’s future, that I believe US should do

                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Meet with leaders of both factions of Democratic Party in an
                                    informal context, such as luncheon, and stress to them
                                    importance that Korean people, United States, and entire Free
                                    World attach to their efforts in months ahead. You might refer
                                    to party’s successful record so far in overcoming traditional
                                    Korean tendency toward factionalism and point out how heavily
                                    their own future, as well as Korea’s depends upon continued
                                    unity, broad-mindedness, and attention to national rather than
                                    factional interests. You might also point out traditional
                                    tendency of political ruling groups to disregard and lose touch
                                    with desires and aspirations of common people until revolt or
                                    revolution topples them, and stress that capacity of a nation to
                                    develop politically depends in large part upon responsiveness of
                                    leadership to people’s needs, as well as upon popular image of
                                    leadership as effective and dedicated to national welfare.

                                    offer channel of communication and interaction between leaders
                                    and people far better than shifting conglomeration of small
                                    blocs in Assembly without grass-roots connections. Thirdly, you
                                    might emphasize need to encourage development of leadership
                                    talent among younger people, both to ensure continuity in future
                                    years and to demonstrate to young men of April Nineteenth

                                    renew cautions against factional strife if it reaches serious

                        <p>Regarding basic long-range recommendations in <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss>, agree all are sound, essential, and deserve
                            support. With particular reference to point (1), we believe that prompt
                            attention to development of an effective, motivated, adequately paid
                            bureaucracy would be highly productive in terms of prospects for Korean
                            stability and progress, both short-run and long-run. Believe Embassy
                            already at work on this <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0708"/>problem
                            and suggest assigning top priority to it. In this connection we have
                            recently reviewed Embdes 641 of April, 1958,<note n="4" xml:id="d325fn4"
                                >Not found.</note> many points in which seem valid in present
                            context. Your own extensive <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> experience
                            makes hardly necessary the caveat that efforts at change in Korea must
                            be made by and through Koreans if they are to have validity and impact
                            on general public. US can supply impetus, support and some advice from
                            usefully objective viewpoint, but our capacity for directly producing
                            permanent Korean social change, except in special areas like technology
                            and military science, is extremely limited. Subject of social change
                            itself now under study in several American universities, notably MIT,
                            and this field might be useful one for Fulbright-sponsored group.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that short-term actions above proposed, especially meetings
                            with political parties, might expose US to charges of intervention in
                            domestic affairs, but believe they are worth risk. (Somewhat similar
                            meetings were held with Liberal and Democratic leaders in 1956, with no
                            known repercussions.) Moreover, if meetings held in context next
                            preceding paragraph, with judicious flattery re accomplishments of April
                            revolution, any impression of intervention could be softened and made to
                            appear as benevolent and constructive interest in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> success.</p>
                        <p>It also recognized that indications of a post-election split in the
                            Democratic Party are multiplying, and that our efforts to hold it
                            together may be unsuccessful in immediate terms. Nevertheless points
                            about dangers of factionalism and need for broad base of stable party
                            organization would be equally valid in any regrouping of alignments–such
                            as merger of <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> “old faction” and
                            ex-Liberal reformists–which might subsequently emerge. The suggested
                            meetings might help to underline in leaders’ minds the importance of
                            these considerations, and thus help to stabilize a new political
                            spectrum if the <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> breaks up.</p>

                                that a climate of determined independence had been engendered by the
                                April revolution, and that Koreans were watching the U.S. Embassy
                                for signs of unwarranted efforts to influence Korean political
                                developments, particularly during the election campaign. He added
                                that U.S. efforts to “start cleaning up Korea’s economic augean
                                stable,” including proposals adopted by the Combined Economic Board
                                for U.S.-Korean cooperation in formulating the South Korean budget,
                                had reinforced growing Korean concern about U.S. interference in
                                internal Korean affairs. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            problem we face in attempting influence current Korean political picture
                            as outlined <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> I accept your
                            judgment that our best course of action is through informal contacts of
                            Embassy officers and yourself with political leaders as occasion arises.
                            Continue however to believe that political developments in next few
                            months are of critical importance from standpoint our objectives in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Democratic Party unity agree that emergence two conservative
                            parties from DP factions and other conservative elements would be
                            excellent basis long-term stability. Danger as we see it is that if
                                <gloss target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> splits neither faction will have
                            broad popular support or adequate grass-roots organization and that
                            National Assembly will become collection of power-seeking cliques. Even
                            if two conservative parties emerge, they may have to form coalition to
                            control Assembly majority. Result again would be situation in which
                            popular support would be subordinated to short-sighted political
                            maneuvering with resultant loss of public confidence. On other hand
                            optimum stability might result as Embassy suggests if <gloss
                                target="#t_DP1">DP</gloss> forms first government and control
                            subsequently passes to new conservative party if latter by that time
                            organized at grass roots. If this analysis valid, <gloss target="#t_DP1"
                                >DP</gloss> split immediately after election on anything like
                            fifty-fifty basis would add to prospect of political instability,
                            ineffective leadership, popular disillusionment with democratic process
                            and consequent opportunity for Communist agitation. As you point out our
                            capacity to avoid this outcome is severely limited, but within this
                            limitation I think we should exert such informal influence as <pb

                        <p>On July 29 elections were held for the reconstituted South Korean
                            National Assembly. Despite demonstrations that disrupted results in a
                            limited number of districts, the elections were viewed by Embassy
                            observers as “free and orderly,” and resulted in a sweeping victory for
                            the Democratic Party. (Telegram 114 from Seoul, July 29; Department of
                            State, Central Files, 795B.00/7–2960) Final results from the 233
                            electoral districts established a commanding majority for the Democratic
                            Party of 177 seats in the House of Representatives, while the Liberal
                            Party shrunk to 12 seats. The remainder were scattered among a variety
                            of minor parties, not one of which was strong enough to constitute a
                            credible opposition. The Democratic Party also dominated the balloting
                            for the new House of Councillors, with 31 of 58 seats and no significant
                            opposition. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BDM2">Bane</persName>

                        <p>The Democratic Party created its own opposition by splitting along “old”
                            and “new” faction lines shortly after the election. Reports from the
                            Embassy in Seoul indicated that the Democratic majority broke down in
                            the House of Representatives into 83 members of the old faction, 79
                            members of the new faction, and 15 members who were difficult to
                            classify. (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.) The legislature met for the
                            first time after the elections on August 8, and the factional breakdown
                            became evident in the election of officers. Paek Nak-jun (L. George
                            Paik), an independent, was elected Chairman of the House of Councillors
                            when old and new faction members of the Democratic Party could not agree
                            on a candidate. (Telegram <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0711"/>159

                        <p>Perhaps a useful way to respond to your letter would be to follow your
                            example and explain some of the considerations underlying our out-going
                            messages, then to analyze the differences between our basic assumptions
                            and yours as a means of bringing our respective positions closer
                            together. I shall do so somewhat at length, and perhaps at the risk of
                            laboring the obvious.</p>
                        <p>For both of us, of course, the point of departure is the basic U.S.
                            objective of a free and stable Korean society and economy, which will at
                            minimum compare favorably with what the Communists are able to do in
                            providing for the basic material and spiritual needs of the Korean
                            people, and at maximum will make of Korea a showcase of what Free World
                            ideals can bring about in Asia by way of realizing economic well-being
                            and social justice.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that the fundamental problems of Korea are social as much
                            as economic and political. The rate of social change in Korea has been
                            so great as to confuse both leaders and people as to the basic values
                            and goals of their national existence. The material and sociological
                            impact of the West–the principal agent of this change–has had much
                            greater influence upon the leaders than upon the agrarian majority, and
                            has therefore increased the leaders’ isolation, both material and
                            social, from their own people. This isolation blocks the channels of
                            communication through which the leaders might keep themselves attuned to
                            popular needs and feelings. It also means that there are not adequate
                            institutional restraints upon the leaders’ conduct such as more mature
                            democracies have developed. The people therefore tend to feel, as they
                            have traditionally felt, that they are impotent to control their
                            government until they finally rise in revolt, and regard their
                            leadership and government as something beyond their ken; the average
                            man, who does not identify himself with the leadership group, finds them
                            a handy target upon which to project the blame for his discontent and
                            deprivations. By the same token, the leaders often do not identify
                            themselves with the people, and tend to look upon them as witless
                            rabble, to be coerced and exploited rather than served.</p>
                        <p>We believe, of course, that our basic concepts of representative
                            democracy and social justice have universal human validity and offer the
                            best means of bringing leaders and people together in a common effort
                            for the national welfare, if these concepts can be firmly rooted in a
                            Korean context. But, as your telegrams make clear, such ideas are not
                            yet firmly integrated into the basic cultural framework, despite the
                            considerable progress which has been made. So far there has not been a
                            leader or group in Korea with the imagination, vision, and energy to
                            give to the nation the definite and believable national ideals, goals,
                            and programs which are essential to give meaning to this democratic
                            framework, to end the Korean spiritual and social confusion, to
                            ameliorate the deep <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0713"/>discontent
                            and even spiritual hunger which underlies so many of Korea’s problems,
                            and to give the country a sense of unity, direction, and destiny. Social
                            progress of this sort is, of course, a precondition of the economic and
                            technical progress which is also essential to the national welfare.
                            Until adequate native leadership emerges, it is incumbent upon us to do
                            what we can to encourage the development of the Republic of Korea in the
                            face of social inertia and ignorance until it can ultimately go it alone
                            as a self-sustaining member of the Free World. We must offer the sort of
                            guidance, inspiration, and support which will avert the ever-present
                            danger of social disintegration, widespread revolution, or subversion,
                            and will bring Korea to the stage labeled by Rostow the “take-off
                                point”.<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">See W. W. Rostow, <hi

                        <p>It is obviously extremely difficult for us to fulfill this mission, and
                            at the same time keep within the limits set by our own ideals of
                            self-sufficiency, self-help, and the right of all peoples to
                            self-determination. As you point out, there is also the danger that if
                            the Koreans depend on us too much, they will not develop in
                            self-government. Furthermore, ideals aside, deep Korean feelings of
                            nationalism and ethnocentrism limit our freedom of action, as do the
                            watchful eyes of the Communist propagandists and Free World opinion
                            generally. I agree that the Constitutional amendment shows the ability
                            of the Koreans to solve a political problem for themselves in their own
                            way, and can be taken as an encouraging sign of progress. I am not sure
                            that in more ordinary times we can yet be sure of similarly fortunate
                            decisions upon the many problems which lie ahead; but to the extent we
                            can expect it, I entirely agree that we can and should reduce our own
                            role accordingly. Nevertheless, the Koreans themselves expect that we
                            will provide guidance, and Americans have often been told throughout the
                            history of our post-war relations with Korea that our correct stand of
                            non-intervention can be misunderstood as lack of friendship and support.
                            During their long period of opposition, leaders of the Democratic Party
                            repeated to Embassy officers ad nauseam their feelings that the United
                            States should somehow prevent the political and economic excesses of the
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> regime and promote the cause of democracy
                            and social justice, while the people themselves were impotent. (One
                            example of this is Embassy despatch 218 of October 20, 1958.<note n="4"

                            and should play a useful role of advice, guidance, and gentle restraint
                            in the fluid Korean political and social situation of the moment, if we
                            had a carefully-conceived and definite concept of how the political
                            picture should evolve in the best interests of Korea and the Free World,
                            and exerted whatever informal pressures we gracefully could to bring it
                            about. I felt that the post-revolution politicians, insufficiently
                            checked by still immature governmental institutions, might otherwise
                            build the same old empire of political advantage, corruption, and
                            disregard for the common welfare which was all too characteristic of the
                            previous regime. In essence, what Koreans have been asking of us is that
                            we are as yet nearly powerless to do so, and help insure that the
                            blessings of our political philosophy and our economic assistance reach
                            down to which the motivation and the sense of urgency can be conveyed to
                            Korean leaders to formulate the necessary national goals, programs, and
                            organizations. Only the Koreans themselves can be a believable source of
                            these requirements; but if the leaders bicker and temporize and
                            unabashedly seek short-run personal advantage at the expense of national
                            welfare for another twelve years, the currents of history may wash over
                            them and remove our brief democratic experiment in Korea without
                            trace.</p>
                        <p>If I interpret correctly our telegrams and your letter, you would have no
                            basic fault to find with the majority of the assumptions and lines of
                            reasoning I have set forth. You suggest, however, that we run the risk
                            of throwing our influence behind a dubious political course of action
                            which would subsequently prove inappropriate, and that we would then
                            bear the onus of having forced undesirable political developments. On
                            this point, I think the difference in our respective points of view is a
                            matter of degree rather than kind. If our advice and influence were to
                            be in terms too specific, or too energetic, or too obviously out of
                            phase with prevailing currents of Korean thought, then we would indeed
                            run unacceptable risks. On the other hand, if our suggestions are
                            soundly conceived, tactfully conveyed, and are obviously directed at the
                            best interests of Korea, then I think on balance our actions will be
                            justified in most Korean eyes and, not being intended as intervention,
                            will not be taken as such except by extremists and the lunatic fringe.
                            As you suggest, we should not expend our ammunition unnecessarily, nor
                            should we be too specific in our suggestions. (In this connection, I
                            hold no strong brief for the proposal of pushing Chang for President,
                            and agree with your analysis that it is too risky.) If we maintain our
                            channels of communication with all segments of Korean opinion, it will
                            be difficult for any one group to charge us with undue influence or
                            intervention. To <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0715"/>some extent we
                            will have to bear such charges anyway–as witness the numerous charges
                            that we supported the <persName>Rhee</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YYC1">You</persName> speak of the necessity of
                            playing the situation by ear. I wholeheartedly agree that inflexibility
                            in politics is indefensible, and that we, like the Korean politicians,
                            must be prepared to shift our ground. The apparent overwhelming
                            Democratic victory, for instance, may well call for a review of our
                            strategy. However, although a ship riding at anchor shifts its position
                            with the tidal currents, it does not drift like a hulk. I think there
                            are certain basic positions which both we and the Koreans should decide
                            upon and take up; our flexibility should take due cognizance of these
                            basic positions, which should be changed only after careful thought has
                            demonstrated the necessity of doing so, and if possible only after new
                            positions have been prepared.</p>
                        <p>In specific reference to the problem of political parties, I agree with
                            you that it may well prove impossible to prevent the split of the
                            Democratic Party either now or later. I believe, however, that too much
                            shifting and splitting of political alignments might well result in the
                            complete breakdown of the new system of government, and if not that,
                            then an atmosphere of disillusioned and cynical political self-seeking
                            which would utterly destroy the splendid spirit engendered by the events
                            of last April. The Koreans have already been through such a cycle of
                            disillusionment; there was a certain enthusiastic fervor in the air in
                            the days immediately following the establishment of the Republic in 1948
                            (notwithstanding fairly widespread admiration at that time for the north
                            Korean regime), but somehow all that enthusiasm had been lost by the
                            time of the Armistice, and some of the excesses of the
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> administration resulted from the general
                            air of cynicism and hopelessness which followed. If the same revulsion
                            of feeling should occur a second time, the anti-Communist ardor of the
                            Koreans may not be strong enough to withstand the temptation to try
                            something new in the hope of finding better social answers to national
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>In summary, it seems to me that there are certain basic principles, the
                            validity of which both we and the Koreans can be sure of, and with which
                            responsible Koreans will agree, in guiding our course of action in the
                            months to come: (1) that basic planning by the national leadership in
                            terms of national goals, programs, and organizations is mandatory; (2)
                            that the new leadership will face a challenge even greater than the
                            previous administration, and must respond to it if democracy is to
                            survive in Korea; (3) that it is essential to the leadership’s success
                            that there be inter-communication with the common people and a sense of
                            participation by both leaders and people in national progress; (4) that
                            in the absence of general prosperity, the only possible substitute must
                            be a general feeling of participation in the common struggle and
                            equitable disposition of deprivations–particularly in respect to
                            tendencies of the <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0716"/>leadership
                            toward conspicuous consumption; (5) that the leadership group must be
                            aware of its responsibilities to the nation in order to maintain itself
                            in power (its consciousness of this fact, I suspect, can disappear
                            surprisingly fast despite the April revolution); (6) that the
                            development of Western democratic institutions, including political
                            parties, is far enough advanced in Korea so that a stable, national
                            organization of a small number of parties offers the best hope at the
                            moment of realizing the necessary participation and inter-communication
                            mentioned above; (7) that a resumption of earlier factionalism,
                            bickering, and self-seeking among politicians in a parliamentary
                            government is unquestionably the greatest danger which faces the Korean
                            body politic at the present time and it must at all costs be held to a
                            minimum. So long as our influence is directed toward Korean developments
                            in accordance with these principles, and is exerted within the limits
                            you have pointed out, it can be of benefit to both the Koreans’ and our
                            own national interests and is, I believe, well worth the risks involved.
                            Our role, as I see it, is one of restraint and inspiration, and as you
                            correctly emphasize, should be carried out in such a way as to promote
                            and encourage the already far-developed capacity of the Koreans to
                            manage for themselves, a self-sustaining society and economy with
                            liberty and justice for all.</p>
                        <p>As you have no doubt surmised, this letter was drafted for me in <gloss
                                target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> but I have studied it carefully against
                            the file and hope that it provides an evocative contribution to our
                            mutual consideration of the problem. In the meantime we are grateful for
                            your luncheon effort with the Democratic leaders which seems to have
                            gone well and, so far as we know, not to have provoked any unfavorable
                            overtones of intervention. The circumstance that the leaders were so
                            unmindful, except in a superficial way, of the magnitude of the problems
                            to be faced emboldens me to think we should continue to explore for
                            discreet means to inspire them to rise above their factional
                                maneuvers.<note n="6" xml:id="d328fn6">On September 6 <persName

                                political, economic, and social sectors, continuing in spirit of
                                April revolution and providing wise, energetic, dedicated leadership
                                and administration, free of corruption and internal dissension, and
                                responsive to people through legislature and party. Success will

                                and bring nation closer to goal of unification, peace, and political
                                and economic freedom. Failure will disillusion both Korean people
                                and those of friendly nations, including US, and might result in
                                worse internal confusion than that of this Spring.</item>

                            <item>Prime requisite of effective administration, in US belief, is
                                effective, dedicated, incorrupt career civil service, police force
                                and military establishment. In this connection US hopes (a) that
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will move promptly to make
                                plans for thoroughgoing reforms these three services to achieve
                                these objectives, (b) that in meantime new Govt will not destroy
                                existing competence of civil service or jeopardize opportunities for
                                reform by hasty purges of working-level personnel based on political
                                considerations rather than evaluation of merit. US will be prepared
                                furnish all appropriate assistance to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                    >ROKG</gloss> in promptly realizing such reforms.</item>

                            <item>US will continue furnish economic and military support. However it
                                virtually impossible that aid level will be increased by Congress,
                                and possibility may have to be faced that aid level for Korea may
                                therefore have be reduced. Therefore we hope <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will avoid undue public emphasis
                                on increased aid, which might cause subsequent embarrassment to Govt
                                before Korean people, and will rest assured that US will do all it
                                possibly can to assist. Positive accomplishments by new Govt will
                                constitute best possible argument for continued aid.</item>

                        <p>After amenities, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1"
                                >McConaughy</persName> said there is a lot going on in Korea and
                            that the government is doing well. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName>, whom the President knows,
                            is turning out to be a good man who wants to work with the Americans.
                            Factionalism exists but this must be expected in oriental countries. The
                            Ambassador himself has tried to stress the fundamentals of national
                            unity in the national interest. The Koreans of course hope that he can
                            secure additional aid for them on this trip.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Korea gets a disproportionate share now of
                            available U.S. foreign aid. In answer to the President’s question, the
                            Ambassador said that $165 million in military support funds are planned
                            for Korea during this fiscal year. The Koreans are working on an
                            exchange rate reform and would like to have a stabilization fund from
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a further question, the Ambassador said the Koreans export
                            rice and a low grade of coal. Possibly they could export fish, minerals
                            and seaweed, but these latter commodities are rather second-rate
                            exports. There is no way of getting around the fact that Korea is a poor
                            country. Their main resource is cheap labor. With it all, they are fine
                            people and he himself harbors warm feelings for them.</p>
                        <p>The President, while expressing his admiration for the Korean people
                            also, said they have got to find a way to work themselves up the
                            economic ladder. We must convince them that their nation is not
                            sovereign if it continues incapable of supporting itself. This is a fact
                            the Koreans do not like to face. The Ambassador agreed but said the
                            Koreans emphasize the unnatural split of their country. Most of their
                            resources are north of the 38th parallel and the manpower is south. The
                            President said he did not understand how Roosevelt and Churchill allowed
                            the Communists into North Korea at the Yalta agreements. He himself had
                            begged Truman at the time of Potsdam not to demean himself by asking the
                            Soviets into the Far Eastern war. The President said that the Russians
                            being in the Kurile Islands does not make sense.</p>
                        <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0722"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> said that
                            Khrushchev plans to visit North Korea on the way back from his present
                            trip. It is surmised that Khrushchev considers it necessary to counter
                            the President’s visit. The thing to watch out for is a unification
                            proposal which Khrushchev might make, which of course would be phoney.
                            The President said that if the Chinese ever ended their domination of
                            North Korea, the North Koreans would be desirous of joining the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s to obtain the benefits that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s enjoy.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1"
                                >McConaughy</persName>’s schedule which will include a visit to
                            Canada in the vicinity of Mt. <persName>Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that his wife as well as he had felt the
                            President’s visit to South Korea had been a great success. The President
                            expressed as his only disappointment the fact that the Japanese failed
                            to cancel his visit before his departure from the United States. All in
                            all, he considered the Far Eastern trip a plus. The Ambassador again
                            agreed and said his wife hopes to communicate with Mrs.
                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName> while here on a two-week stay. The
                            President told me to arrange for Mrs. <persName>Eisenhower</persName> to
                            see Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName>. (This has
                            been arranged for Monday, September 19th.)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> then
                            expressed great satisfaction with the way his country team is working in
                            Korea and expressed admiration for General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1"
                                >Magruder</persName> and Dr. <persName>Moyer</persName> of <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1"
                                >Magruder</persName>, in particular, is having problems with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army, which needs a pay raise
                            beyond the financial capabilities of the government. The President said
                            he feared getting a bunch of mendicants on our hands. He has no
                            suggestions as to what to do to bolster the Korean economy, but thought
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s might examine their military
                            strength. A country cannot thrive if it keeps a large proportion of its
                            population “on the front.” Six or seven years ago he had proposed a
                            scheme which we considered reasonable but which had been rejected by
                                <persName>Rhee</persName>. Given his choice,
                                <persName>Rhee</persName> would have had an army of forty divisions.
                            Like Chiang Kai-shek, he nurtured dreams of attack against the
                            North.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the President’s question, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCWPJ1">McConaughy</persName> said that the army pay
                            scale is comparable to that in the rest of the country. Their
                            top-ranking generals are paid the equivalent of $70-80 per month. This
                            fact produces a temptation to corruption–the selling of tires and
                            gasoline and the like. The situation is better, thanks to the work of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1">Magruder</persName> who is a
                            logistics expert. The Ambassador said he feels that with it all the
                            Koreans must keep a strong military position. The President agreed. The
                            Ambassador said the new government would like to cut military strength
                            by 100,000 men. General <persName corresp="#p_MLGCB1"
                                >Magruder</persName><pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0723"
                            />considers this too high a figure under his present instructions and
                            would prefer the cut restricted to 50,000.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to the subject of bureaucracy, in which the
                            President mentioned with some feeling the salaries and expense accounts
                            and privileges which the Congress sees fit to vote to itself. The
                            Ambassador agreed.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President said he assumed our government would try to
                            help the Koreans a little more. Our aid is spread thin and it is
                            difficult to justify disproportionate aid to a little jut on the
                            continent of Asia. This location is important principally because we
                            have given our word that we will defend it. He agreed that, given our
                            existing conditions, it is necessary for us to stand behind the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. He agreed with the Ambassador that
                            South Korea in the hands of the Communists would be an extremely
                            distressing thing for the Japanese. The Ambassador said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> is trying his best to
                            improve relations between Japan and South Korea.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, the meeting ended.</p>

                                from Seoul, October 12, the Embassy concurred with the Department’s
                                assessment of the importance of encouraging the Chang government to
                                take the measures necessary to achieve political stability. The
                                problem had been highlighted by student demonstrations in Seoul,
                                which began on October 8 to protest court decisions resulting in
                                mild sentences for former members of the <persName>Rhee</persName>
                                government, and culminated on October 11 with a brief takeover of
                                the National Assembly by student leaders. The key to the problem
                                facing the Chang government, the Embassy felt, was to establish a
                                working majority in the Assembly. Green noted that Chang was not a
                                forceful personality, and, although Green planned to encourage him
                                to move to strengthen his political support, he felt it would not be
                                wise to push the Prime Minister too hard or to create the impression
                                that <persName>Chang</persName> was taking directions from

                            offers every promise of giving his Govt a good working majority in

                            conservative parties. This, he stated, will put an end to “years of

                            lists may be announced tomorrow. He described development as paving way
                            for two conservative parties, and assured me that he would “help and

                        <p>I replied that this was most welcome news. Following approach indicated

                                >PriMin</gloss> in exercising leadership and obstructed
                            administration from moving forward to complete such tasks as

                            creation public confidence. I stressed our concern over irresponsible
                            criticism which tended to weaken confidence in administration and
                            emphasized our view that Govt must take firm position of leadership
                            resulting in decisive action on all fronts. We felt that firm decisive
                            action would be widely welcome in the Korean community. I said that I

                                >PriMin</gloss> was about to achieve a working majority because I
                            knew this would free him to take the decisive measures in political,
                            economic and other fields he knew demanded immediate attention.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> indicated he fully shared our
                            concern on question popular attitudes toward Govt and atmosphere
                            discontent highlighted by recent student demonstrations. He expressed
                            satisfaction with his three hour meeting last evening with newspaper
                            presidents and editors in chief and informed me that they in full
                            agreement that effort must be made to restrain student agitation. <gloss

                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> also confirmed report that

                            “responsibility” for student invasion of Assembly Oct. 11; he expressed
                            hope that Assembly would not accept resignation since he considers Kwak
                            best qualified for post. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            stated, however, that <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0725"

                            incident” and that Home Min probably would have to resign.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> insisted that students pose
                            particularly difficult problem for govt. Although he indicated Govt
                            reluctant employ force to deal with student demonstrators, he expressed
                            impatience with all these continuing demonstrations and he felt action
                            required to redress situation. He mentioned that consideration being
                            given to bill prohibiting demonstrations in vicinity public buildings,
                            and expressed hope that this would provide some basis for dealing more
                            effectively and forcefully with situation.</p>
                        <p>He concurred with my remarks on necessity Govt act more positively to
                            improve its public image and with my suggestion that clear statement of
                            govt’s legislative program would go far to provide public with sense
                            direction and understanding govt’s efforts. Re latter, <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> stated that he intends have all
                            cabinet members explain their policies in detail to public. He
                            commented, however, that press contains many corrupt and irresponsible
                            elements, a situation which creates serious problems for govt. He agreed
                            that measures should be taken to cope with rumormongers and
                            irresponsible newspapermen.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my comments on importance of various “purges” being completed
                            promptly, Prime Minister stated that this drive will be wound up with
                            this month.</p>
                        <p>As to police and internal security problem, Prime Minister in full
                            agreement regarding importance of constructive steps being taken
                            immediately; he stated that government moving ahead with plans for

                            to improve technical competence police and internal security agencies.
                            He welcomed any advice or special guidance or assistance we could render
                            in this field. We discussed various measures to improve integrity and
                            efficacy of police system.</p>
                        <p>At close our discussion, I expressed our confidence in ability and
                            determination present government to meet tasks which face it and assured
                            Prime Minister that we prepared, as appropriate, make public expressions
                            our support. Prime Minister stated that he highly pleased by
                            Department’s October 12 statement. He also suggested that at such time
                            as Govt succeeds in obtaining working majority, it would be helpful to
                            him if Department would express its satisfaction with such a development
                            and its hope that people and government could now unite in
                            accomplishment of task ahead.</p>
                        <p>I assured Prime Minister that Department would wish make such statement.
                            I emphasized that it would be particularly opportune if development
                            which he anticipates could be realized soonest so the Department’s

                            administration. It evident from conversation today, however, that to
                            date he has considered resolution factional problem and creation working
                            majority to be essential prerequisite to setting his administration on
                            course of decisive action and firm leadership. Fact that he feels close
                            to surmounting this problem may, in fact, encourage him take more

                        <p>Although Prime Minister’s optimism on establishment working majority may
                            be somewhat premature, fact that both sides now appear prepared

                            new party, group of approximately 20 to 30 moderates will move into

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has committed itself to a
                                new and positive approach to foreign relations, especially with
                                respect to Japan. Within the limits imposed by the remnants of
                                anti-Japanese feeling, the <persName>Chang</persName> government
                                will probably be willing to negotiate settlement of most outstanding

                                before <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese relations will
                                be normal. Although prospects for US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            <item>We believe that the national consensus will continue to support
                                attachment with the US and the West as being essential for defense
                                against renewed Communist aggression and necessary for maintenance
                                of the economy. However, the new feeling of nationalism, together
                                with the yearning for unification and a vague resentment over
                                Korea’s weak position in the East-West power struggle, will probably
                                cause increased interest in neutralism and diminished responsiveness
                                to US guidance. (Para. 42)</item>

                                responding effectively to popular aspirations and dealing

                                and society, with policies, institutions, and positive programs of

                            <p>3. Economic progress conducive to political and social stability, to
                                lessened dependence on external military and economic assistance,
                                and to the eventual attainment of a self-supporting economy.</p>

                                Communist expansion or subversion.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies as feasible and

                            <p>10. Emphasize to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders the view
                                that, whatever their short-term problems, the long-run viability of
                                Korea as an independent and self-sustaining nation will depend on
                                what they do to meet the aspirations of their citizens for social
                                progress and for individual dignity.</p>
                            <p>11. Project to Korean leaders and people a steady and reliable vision
                                of the increasingly democratic and progressive society which they
                                can develop and of the interest of the United States in furthering
                                these Korean objectives. In this context, emphasize contacts with
                                and programs for young people–especially students–labor leaders, and
                                other potential sources of leadership and influence.</p>
                            <p>12. Promote among Korean leaders and the public an understanding of
                                Free World political, economic, and cultural ideals as valid bases
                                for realizing the material and spiritual aspirations of the Korean
                                people, in contrast with the illusory short-term material successes
                                claimed by the Communists.</p>
                            <p>13. Encourage <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders to
                                formulate appropriate national goals consonant with Free World
                                principles, and to direct the growing Korean nationalist feeling,
                                especially among students, intellectuals and labor leaders, into
                                support for programs of reform and development, thus discouraging
                                tendencies toward totalitarian ideologies, Marxism, or neutralism.
                                Encourage and assist the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                Government to complement this effort with appropriate educational,
                                informational, and internal security programs and actions consistent
                                with democratic principles, including a vigorous campaign for the

                            is filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another copy is attached to

                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that the first
                            “split in the paper occurred in Paragraph 30 dealing with the
                            contingency <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0738"/>of a renewal of
                            hostilities in Korea by Communist forces. State and <gloss
                                target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> would provide that in our response to
                            such renewal of hostilities, we would “insofar as possible limit these
                            hostilities to the Korean Peninsula.” The majority would allow more
                            latitude for our response by deleting the phrase “to the Korean
                            Peninsula,” while still retaining the general restraint imposed by the
                            words “insofar as possible”. The Joint Chiefs of Staff propose that the
                            entire sentence be deleted.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> felt that it
                            would be impossible to make a greater mistake with respect to Korea than
                            to say now that we would create some sort of sanctuary for the enemy in
                            the event of a renewal of hostilities. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he would agree to
                            eliminate the entire sentence as proposed by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then referred to the
                            difference in view reflected in Paragraph 31. In this paragraph the
                            majority would continue providing military assistance to the Republic of
                            Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) at mutually-agreed levels,
                            whereas Treasury and Budget would limit such assistance to levels not
                            exceeding those of recent years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> pointed out that the Financial Appendix contained a
                            corresponding split reflecting this majority and Treasury–Budget view of
                            the cost implications of the proposed military assistance policy. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that the difference
                            of view in Paragraph 32, dealing with our policy toward the desires of
                            the new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to reduce its
                            forces, was related to the split over military assistance policy in
                            Paragraph 31.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the question of
                            the level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces and the level of
                            our military assistance to Korea were not closely related. Reduced force
                            levels for Korea might result from an increase in military assistance
                            which enabled the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to be
                            modernized with new equipment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> pointed out that the
                            Financial Appendix figures for military assistance reflected a 75 per
                            cent increase over previous years. The purpose of the Budget position on
                            this question was to bring in focus the question of such a substantial
                            increase in military assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                                >Stans</persName> then pointed to a statement in the General
                            Considerations of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018 (Paragraph 3)
                            that “it is unlikely that we will be able to devote the same proportion
                            or amount of foreign aid to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in
                            future years as has been the case in the past decade.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said the Budget position on
                            Paragraph 31 was intended to reflect the statement he had just read and
                            to counter the Financial Appendix figures. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> believed this was a very
                            important issue. He said there were many other statements both in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018 and in recent National
                            Intelligence Estimates which made it clear that Korea wants both a large
                            defense establishment and increased consumption. He wondered whether
                            Korea could continue to bear the burden of such large forces. The latest
                            National Intelligence Estimate on <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709"
                                facs="0739"/>Korea indicated that barring unification, a large-scale
                            reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be
                            necessary if the needs of the Korean civil economy were to be met. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> thought the question
                            was, will the U.S. support and encourage the efforts of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to reduce its armed forces?
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> felt this was a
                            question which should not be decided hastily; he therefore wondered
                            whether further consideration of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            6018 should not be deferred to a later meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>’ comments. He added
                            that the Financial Appendix assumed that the total U.S. budget for
                            military assistance would be $2.4 billion whereas it now seemed likely
                            that the total military assistance budget would be $1.8 billion. <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018 therefore was based on assumptions
                            which could not be realized. The major point was how long could Korea
                            maintain a 600,000 man army and remain an economically viable
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the military
                            assistance figures in the Financial Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 6018 was based on the Five Year Military Assistance
                            Plan which indicated that $2.2 billion was the minimum necessary total
                            figure. Korean divisions were now equipped with second-hand World War II
                            equipment which was obsolete, inadequate, and inferior to North Korean
                            equipment. The large sums suggested for military assistance to Korea
                            were intended to effect a large-scale re-equipment of the Korean forces
                            and in addition to add three surface-to-air missile battalions which
                            would be placed in the more important Korean ports. Moreover, it was
                            intended to equip the Korean Air Force with Century series airplanes to
                            keep up with the qualitative standards of the North Korean Air Force. In
                            the absence of this modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces, Korea would have to accept substantial
                            inferiority vis-à-vis North Korean forces or else U.S. forces would have
                            to be provided to make up the difference in capabilities. The fact that
                            future <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government actions or future
                            developments in Korea could not be completely foreseen was not a reason
                            for providing in an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper that
                            military assistance could not be increased. Rather it was desirable in
                            the paper to provide some flexibility so that military assistance could
                            be fixed at mutually-agreed levels. However, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that military assistance
                            for Korea for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 would probably be
                            less than the sums shown in the Financial Appendix. He believed it would
                            be a mistake nevertheless to attempt to write the budget into each
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper. He therefore proposed
                            that the majority language for Paragraph 31 be adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> believed that the
                            majority language in Paragraph 31 together with the figures in the
                            Financial Appendix constituted an endorsement of the spending program
                            reflected in the Financial Appendix. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> suggested that the Financial Appendix be revised to
                            reflect current assumptions as to expenditures on military assistance.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that the
                            Council was not being asked to approve <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710"
                                facs="0740"/>the Financial Appendix. Indeed, each Financial Appendix
                            contained a statement to the effect that it was not approved policy. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> suggested that in view of
                            the time, the remainder of the discussion on <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 6018 be postponed to a later meeting.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> pointed out that paragraph
                            32 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018 reads: “Insofar as
                            consistent with U.S. policy objectives, undertake to reach agreement
                            with the Government of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> on [such
                            proposals as it may make with regard to]<note n="3" xml:id="d336fn3"
                                >Brackets in the source text.</note> reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces.” The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff propose inclusion of the bracketed words. The President said he
                            also felt that the bracketed words should be included in the paper.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> pointed out
                            that the United States might wish to propose reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces and would not wish to have its
                            hands tied by language which referred only to those proposals which the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might make. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> also felt that this government
                            should retain the initiative to consider any such reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, whether proposed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> or not. The President said the military
                            services wish to include the bracketed language because they feel Korean
                            forces have already been reduced to a minimum. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> agreed, adding the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had a long frontier which must be
                            adequately defended if attack by North Korea were not to be invited. The
                            Joint Chiefs believed that Korea had the manpower to meet the present
                            force levels which, however, were marginal. If the military situation
                            changed, the United States might be able to take the initiative in
                            proposing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force reductions. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> pointed out that <gloss
                                target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 42.1–2–60 indicated that reductions in
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be necessary if
                            Korea were to stand a chance of developing a viable economy. He also
                            noted that the Korean Democratic Party platform in the recent election
                            had promised to reduce <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces by
                            100,000 men, the money thus saved to be shifted to economic development.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> felt that the United
                            States was in the position of opposing reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces while conceding that the only
                            salvation for the Korean economy was a reduction of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>The President felt that the language suggested by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff was satisfactory because it said we would consider proposals made
                            by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> believed the language precluded
                            us from making proposals on our own initiative. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said we had a great stake in
                            Korea. He had once had responsibility for administering both the
                            economic and military assistance programs in that country. He believed
                            that unless we assured the military security of Korea we would merely be
                            building up the Korean economy so that it could be taken over by the
                            Communists whenever they wanted it. He believed the present Korean
                            forces represented the minimum necessary to defend the 155-mile
                            frontier. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said he
                            understood the North Korean forces included in the neighborhood of
                            300,000 men. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                            pointed out that the North Korean forces were backed up by large
                            Communist Chinese armies deployed just across the Yalu. The President
                            said the bracketed language should be left in the paper. In <pb n="712"
                                xml:id="pg_712" facs="0742"/>effect we are saying we won’t push for
                            further reductions in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces at
                            this time because the Chiefs of Staff believe further reductions would
                            jeopardize the security of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> referred to pages 33 and
                            34 of the Financial Appendix.<note n="4" xml:id="d336fn4">See
                                Supplement.</note> He said he understood that Defense was
                            reconsidering the whole framework of military assistance as a result of
                            the decision to reduce the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss></p>
                        <p>1962 military assistance program appropriation request from $2.4 billion
                            to $1.8 billion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName>
                            confirmed the need for reviewing the military assistance figures, and
                            said such a review involved obtaining the views of the unified
                            commanders. This process, which would of necessity be followed by a
                            joint State–Defense review, could not be completed until some time in
                            January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then turned to page 15 of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018, and pointed out that the
                            Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Planning Board
                            representatives propose deletion of a sentence in the General
                                Considerations.<note n="5" xml:id="d336fn5">The sentence in question
                                is the final sentence in the first paragraph on page 15, as
                                published in the Supplement.</note> The President said he believed
                            the statement in question was not a proper statement for an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, and directed that it be deleted.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFCJ1">Scribner</persName> asked whether Table
                            I was to be left in the Financial Appendix, later figures being supplied
                            by the Department of Defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                                >Gates</persName> said the Department of Defense proposed to adjust
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 military assistance figures
                            in early January and submit them for inclusion in the Financial
                            Appendix. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> asked whether
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 and <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964 figures would also be adjusted. He said he assumed
                            that if these figures were not adjusted the footnote on page 9 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6018 would apply–that is, that any
                            proposal for a significant increase over present levels of U.S. support
                            would be brought to the Council for consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then read a proposed
                            paragraph for the Record of Action, dealing with preparations for
                            negotiating under paragraph 37 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            6018. (The paragraph read by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> appears as subparagraph d in the action below.) The
                            President said he believed this paragraph represented wishful thinking,
                            but he had no objection to its inclusion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> said there appeared to be more developments in
                            connection with unification now than at any previous time.</p>
