                        1925, by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the

                        constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States.
                        These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                        documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                        decisions within the range of the Department of State’s responsibilities,
                        together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed
                        to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                        supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper

                            >Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the Historical
                        Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the Department of State. The editing of
                        the record is guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There may
                        be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the
                        text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                        importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                        concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                        policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the

                            <p>Upon termination final meeting Bao Dai spokesman stated: “We agreed

                            <p>260. Pignon informed us today in utmost confidence govt has made
                                important decision to request Assembly approval outcome present
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>He stated Cannes conversations had resulted in agreement on
                                fundamentals and the parties were well along in drafting stage. Bao
                                Dai had insisted and Pignon had agreed that because of present
                                status of Cochin China previous parliamentary approval was essential
                                if agreements were effectively to confer on Vietnam the attributes
                                of unity and independence which are heart of Baie d’Along accord and
                                represent minimum to insure acceptance of Bao Dai solution by
                                people. While measures might be taken in Saigon to transfer
                                administrative functions to Vietnamese, the administration of
                                justice can only be transferred by a positive legislative act.
                                Sovereignty, he said, has two aspects—external and internal, for
                                internal sovereignty it is justice. Under Cochin China treaty
                                justice is in hands of French. It cannot be transferred to
                                Vietnamese without formal change in status of Cochin China which
                                necessitates parliamentary approval.</p>
                            <p>Govt is now studying timing of Bao Dai’s return and form of
                                submission to Parliament. Pignon (who professes no competence in
                                politics) stated any debate would have to take place before cantonal
                                elections, i.e. before March 15, and implied Bao Dai would not
                                return before then. He recognized political difficulties which faced
                                govt, but did not consider either Gaullist or Socialist leadership
                                would actively oppose agreements. He thought however that there
                                would undoubtedly be large number of abstentions. He was reservedly
                                optimistic of favorable vote but said if govt should reverse
                                decision to present matter squarely to Parliament or if vote was
                                negative he would resign.</p>
                            <p>Embassy will watch carefully and report political evolution this
                                decision to grasp nettle which, however sound in conception, will
                                present govt with series very tricky political problems. Pignon
                                leaves for Saigon January 24.</p>

                            <p>718. Buuloc, Bao Dai’s cousin and <hi rend="italic">Chef de
                                    Cabinet</hi>, who has just returned from Cannes, told us last
                                night that conversations were progressing in generally satisfactory
                                manner and it was hoped complete negotiations next week when Bao Dai
                                comes to Paris at invitation President Auriol. In this event Bao Dai
                                would return in early April on French warship. His cousin said he
                                had ordered complete set tropical clothing.</p>
                            <p>Formula for changed status Cochin-China and ratification by French
                                Parliament which Buuloc indicated Bao Dai had accepted now appears
                                to be following: Article 75 French Constitution provides status
                                parts French Republic and French Union can evolve and that change
                                from one category to another takes place by law voted by French
                                Parliament after appropriate territorial assembly and Assembly
                                French Union have been consulted. Cochin-China, now French overseas
                                territory, would become part of Vietnam, an associated state of
                                French Union. Thus abandonment of sovereignty or cession of
                                territory, as contemplated under Article 27 of Constitution, would
                                take place and no referendum required. Therefore after return Bao
                                Dai and favorable vote of to-be-organized territorial assembly of
                                Cochin-China and Assembly French Union, French Parliament would be
                                requested vote law confirming desire Cochin-China change its status
                                under Article 75 rather than cession of territory under Article 27.
                                (Not clear why this was not thought up before.) Presumably
                                Parliament receive at same time above described law for approval and
                                treaty for ratification.</p>
                            <p>Re diplomatic classes agreement, Buuloc told us that Bao Dai could
                                have diplomatic secretaries attached to any French mission but that
                                number of separate missions would be limited to three. He and French
                                are agreed on Siam and Vatican but for third French propose China
                                and Bao Dai wants (but does not expect to get) Washington. There is
                                no limitation, however, on number foreign missions Bao Dai can
                                receive and Buuloc hinted strongly that former Emperor was looking
                                forward to welcoming in the near future first American minister
                                there.</p>

                                abilities when negots were first undertaken with him two years ago.
                                Accordingly Emb should make clear to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"

                                pre-election political manoeuvering in France and will soon be

                                launched under better circumstances than we had hoped for in view
                                domestic French political situation” and “affords workable basis for
                                fulfillment Vietnam aspirations.”</p>
                            <p>Our source states that while elements of agreement so far made public
                                naturally emphasize advantages to France, other side of coin is
                                quite favorable to Vietnam and it is now up to Bao Dai’s supporters
                                to see that this aspect gets wide publicity in Vietnam. (“Very fact

                                both made preliminary unofficial requests that US give serious

                                positions as they were replaced by new Vietnam units. He did not
                                imply lessening of French military effort Indochina but rather shift
                                of emphasis operationally to new national army. Both men emphasised
                                necessity of rapid action in Indochina if “liberation” was to have
                                substantially progressed before Mao Tse[-tung]’s army reached

                            <p>Devinat repeated his now familiar theme that ridding <gloss

                                and that France was doing its bit in making liberal agreement with

                                both France and Vietnam would need material and moral support from

                                complete text, in English translation of a letter addressed by
                                Ex-Emperor Bao Dai to Governor Huu<note n="1" xml:id="d17fn1">Tran
                                    Van Huu; letter not printed.</note> of Cochinchina under date of
                                March 16, 1949, at which time Huu was in France consulting with the
                                Ex-Emperor. Publication of the letter has just been authorized by
                                the Ex-Emperor, and the text has been widely circulated in
                                Saigon.</p>
                            <p>The statement is regarded as an important declaration of policy and
                                has been well received in all “Unionist” circles in Saigon, both
                                Vietnamese and French. The prominent French newspaper in Saigon, <hi
                                    rend="italic">Le Journal de l’Extrême Orient</hi>, has taken
                                particular pleasure in noting the contents of the penultimate
                                paragraph dealing with French interests in Cochinchina and says so
                                in a leading article in today’s issue. Die-hard French colonial
                                circles and the newspapers which are their mouthpiece give full
                                coverage to the statement but refrain from comment.</p>
                            <p>The text of the declaration has, in fact, been published on the first
                                page of all Saigon’s leading newspapers today in conjunction with
                                the news concerning the results of the Territorial Assembly
                                elections. It is notable that although returns are as yet
                                incomplete, the Vietnamese candidates in the Saigon–Cholon area who
                                listed themselves as “Unionists” in favor of junction of the three

                                question, have made a clean sweep. It is possible that any
                                connection between the two events is circumstantial, but it is much
                                more likely that President Huu was strongly influenced by his
                                knowledge of the Ex-Emperor’s policy regarding union of the three

                            <p>Mr. Daridan called at his request to discuss problems raised by the
                                projected return of Bao Dai to Indochina. He opened the conversation
                                by saying that people in Paris, by that meaning French officials,
                                appeared to have a different idea as to what the US might be willing
                                to do to assist Bao Dai than that of the French Embassy in
                                Washington. In this connection he said that a high American
                                official, whom he preferred not to name, had so expressed himself as
                                to lead the French officials to believe that the US might be
                                disposed to give some backing to Bao Dai, possibly by furnishing
                                military equipment. Mr. Daridan said that the foregoing conversation
                                had been brought to the attention of the French Embassy in
                                Washington with roughly the query why the Embassy had reported the
                                improbability of the US giving any backing to Bao Dai, at least at
                                this time. Following a general discussion of the situation not only
                                in Indochina but also in the Far East as a whole, including an
                                explanation of the capacity in which Bao Dai is returning to
                                Indochina, Mr. Daridan posed the question whether the US would be
                                prepared to assist Bao Dai if in the course of the coming months his
                                cause showed some signs of success. I replied that I could not give
                                an answer to such a hypothetical question and that we would have to
                                be guided by circumstances existing at the time. I continued that
                                the whole matter of assistance to Bao Dai or to anyone must be
                                viewed in the light of what the Indochinese or any of the Far
                                Eastern peoples did on their own behalf—that the US could not be
                                expected to supply arms, for instance, if the peoples wanting the
                                arms did not show a desire and willingness to use them against
                                communist or unfriendly pressure. Mr. Daridan agreed that that was a
                                reasonable position to take.</p>
                            <p>During the course of the conversation Mr. Daridan intimated that Bao
                                Dai might be hesitating to return to Indochina and evidently hoped
                                that the US would bring what pressure was possible on him to induce
                                him to proceed with announced plans. I remarked that Bao Dai was
                                thinking of his neck and Mr. Daridan was in agreement, and he also
                                gave the impression that Bao Dai’s chances of success were not
                                brilliant.</p>

                                />conversation with the Secretary and he said that he believed Mr.
                                Schuman had discussed transferring two pursuit plane (King Cobra)
                                squadrons from France to Indochina. He made available the text of a
                                telegram addressed to Mr. Schuman in which the latter was urged to
                                get the Department’s consent, at least tacit consent, to this
                                transfer on the ground that the planes would be used to combat Mao
                                Tse Tung’s communist forces when they reached the Tonkinese border
                                and entered Indochina. As the planes had come from the US the French
                                Government hoped to regularize such a transfer by securing the
                                Department’s prior consent. I pointed out that the arrival of Mao at
                                the Tonkinese border did not appear to be as imminent as the French
                                Air Chief of Staff appeared to think, that experience in China had
                                greatly discounted the use of this type of plane against ground
                                operations in and over the terrain which had been encountered in
                                China and which would be encountered in Tonkin, and that definitely
                                I could not give any degree of consent to the proposed transfer. The
                                whole matter, I concluded, must rest in abeyance and be considered
                                only in the future in the light of actual developments.</p>
                            <p>[It was evident that Mr. Daridan was under instructions to sound out
                                the Department as to the help Bao Dai might expect, that the opinion
                                in Paris as to what help might be forthcoming was far different from
                                that of the French Embassy at Washington, and that the question of
                                the planes was a probable feeler in the direction of transferring
                                American-provided military equipment in France to Indochina. Mr.
                                Daridan was given no encouragement on either point.]<note n="2"

                                rumors re Emperor’s present or proposed contacts with Ho Chi Minh
                                and fears expressed certain French circles Communists will
                                infiltrate and take over new regime? Obvious such danger exists.
                                Nevertheless adherence substantial portion non-Communist elements
                                resistance is essential feature Bao Dai solution and this requires
                                contacts with them and probably inclusion resistance elements in
                                government. Selection such elements will be crucial test Bao Dai’s
                                political ability and he may be tempted to include some Communists
                                perhaps even Ho in order to achieve immediate end fighting. It might
                                be desirable to bring to his attention many examples proving
                                futility and danger of collaboration with Stalinists but presume

                                puppet regime, it must first be clear Fr will offer all necessary
                                concessions to make Baodai solution attractive to nationalists. This
                                is step of which Fr themselves must see urgent necessity view
                                possibly short time remaining before Commie successes Chi are felt
                                Indochina. Moreover, Baodai Govt must through own efforts
                                demonstrate capacity organize and conduct affairs wisely so as to
                                ensure maximum opportunity obtaining requisite popular support

                            <p>Assuming essential Fr concessions are forthcoming, best chance
                                success Baodai wld appear lie in persuading Vietnamese nationalists
                                (1) their patriotic aims may be realized promptly through Fr-Baodai
                                agreement (2) Baodai govt will be truly representative even to
                                extent including outstanding non-Commie leaders now supporting Ho
                                and (3). Baodai solution probably only means safeguarding Vietnam
                                from aggressive designs Commie Chi. While attainment these
                                objectives depends initially upon attitude Fr and Baodai circle,

                                Asian govts. Appeal such solution to Vietnam nationalists wld
                                presumably be far greater if it appeared sponsored by free Asian

                                decisive action by French Assembly after May 17 query Cochin China
                                territorial assembly resolution and ratification March 8
                                accords.</p>
                            <p>Xuan asked what would be US policy in supporting or even nominating
                                Vietnam for membership UN event France does not live up obligation
                                do so under terms accords or stalls. Emperor attaches great
                                importance prompt UN membership even in recognition of what he
                                regards as “possibility” USSR veto.</p>
                            <p>President extremely concerned developments China and reaction it will
                                have Chinese minorities Vietnam. In this query, as virtually all
                                others, he regards time element highly important in influencing
                                margin Bao Dai’s chances success.</p>
                            <p>He stated further Emperor would definitely visit Hanoi before leaving
                                Vietnam. Departure planned about one month after French National
                                Assembly takes decisive action two matters enumerated above. Emperor
                                will return France, but Xuan states he plans go Washington
                                thereafter both establish contact and, I ventured, probably ask arms
                                for new Vietnamese army among other things. Xuan readily admitted
                                this.</p>
                            <p>Xuan reports Emperor does not regard failure publish March 8 accords
                                to date as important—states done purely for internal French <pb

                                they are so favorable to Vietnam, not reverse.</p>
                            <p>Xuan reports Emperor landed Dalat extremely pessimistic frame mind as
                                result of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) military developments China and
                                Tonkinese border which he felt might cause crisis before he could
                                establish his presence and form government; (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) what he considered French loophole contained
                                territorial assembly’s resolution. Emperor has since readjusted his
                                thinking and discarded concerns with (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                entirely and thinks possibility of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                temporarily postponed, but danger ever present.</p>
                            <p>Xuan considers military query primary importance and agrees heartily
                                but privately with urgency of need French reinforcements men and
                                materiel to forestall further Viet Minh successes north and maintain
                                sufficient order make it possible for National elements who wish
                                rally Emperor’s side to do so. Note: I am informed by reliable
                                journalistic source here that long time National Hanoi estimates
                                true “National” deflections [<hi rend="italic">defections</hi>] Viet
                                Minh will be limited less than 10 percent.</p>
                            <p>I questioned President what further consideration was being given to
                                making conciliatory gesture Ho Chi Minh, even perhaps as far as
                                offering him portfolio new cabinet as had been suggested by Xuan
                                during our last discussion Saigon. He made entirely evasive and
                                ambiguous answers to such an extent I am now convinced such
                                eventuality is under active consideration at least by Xuan himself
                                if not with Emperor’s approbation.</p>
                            <p>On latter point Department may wish issue guiding instruction to us
                                as what tack follow with Xuan and perhaps others this specific
                                query. I think any simple statement to Xuan now or near future to
                                Emperor by Consul General Abbott regarding Ho the Stalinist vs Ho
                                the National would strongly influence direction any such move. Xuan
                                and probably Emperor are lead think more and more, notably most
                                recently by April 25 <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> article, US
                                looks almost favorably on Ho and considers him as much National as
                                Communist. Study Viet Minh broadcasts, recent survey which now en
                                route Department, are sufficient in themselves dispel any such naive
                                theory, and it might be useful point out at this time <hi
                                    rend="italic">Newsweek</hi> and other recent similar articles
                                not only do not necessarily coincide with views US Government but
                                exactly how they differ.</p>
                            <p>This interview with President more significant and profitable than
                                usual for his sentiments obviously grew out consultations with
                                Emperor in Dalat (he referred constantly to notes). It probably took
                                    <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0041"/>place as it did at all
                                only because direct contact between Bao Dai and Abbott is not yet
                                feasible. Sent Department 36, repeated Paris.</p>

                            <p>The meeting was called to consider what steps, if any, we might
                                profitably take in Indochina.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> representatives noted that
                                the agreement of March 8 between Baodai and Auriol left France in
                                nearly full control of Vietnam’s foreign relations and in
                                substantial control of Vietnam’s armed forces and hence that there
                                seemed little chance that the agreement would appeal to Vietnamese
                                nationalists or that the Baodai experiment would succeed.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> representatives explained that
                                there was no chance whatsoever of the French making any concessions
                                at the present time beyond those contained in the agreement, and
                                that for us to press them to do so would only stiffen and antagonize
                                them.</p>
                            <p>It was the consensus of the meeting that the US should not put itself
                                in a forward position in the Indochina problem since there appeared
                                to be nothing we could do to alter the very discouraging prospects,
                                and that we should endeavor to “collectivize” our approach to the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, it was determined that <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss>
                                would instruct Embassy Paris to endeavor to obtain openly the text
                                of the agreement between Baodai and Auriol in order that we might
                                discuss it with the French and other governments. Embassy Paris
                                would also be instructed to obtain copies of the documents
                                associated with the agreement, some of which the Department has not
                                received from any source and which are believed to include
                                provisions for the transfer of the federal services to the Bao-dai
                                Government.</p>

                            <p>In particular it was decided that we should aim at establishing a
                                common position with the British, the Indians, and the

                                be determined only by reaction nationalists themselves. Meanwhile
                                wld appreciate your view.</p>
                            <p>While not fully informed provisions Mar 8 agreements plus associated
                                documents, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> fears nationalist
                                opinion will follow line Duoc Viet editorial Apr 9 which states
                                “although Vietnamese reassured on score their country’s unification,
                                they remain uneasy about question foreign relations and army.
                                Vietnam sovereignty will not permit Vietnamese army be commanded by

                                diplomatic representation only in China, Siam and Vatican.”</p>
                            <p>As practical matter, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> believes
                                that when independence movement in colony too strong to be defeated,
                                metropolitan power if it wishes preserve influence in area has no
                                real choice but attempt establish special relationship with former
                                colony based free acceptance terms by latter, and that assoc between
                                metropolitan power and former colony is more likely prove fruitful
                                and durable if based free consent of latter than if transfer of
                                autonomous powers to latter is made conditional upon its acceptance
                                of such important qualifications upon its independence as continued
                                metropolitan control its fon relations and command armed forces.</p>
                            <p>However, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> persuaded Fr unlikely
                                make further concessions this time and that any US efforts press
                                them do so wld probably miscarry. (Paris to indicate if this not
                                correct.) Hope is, therefore, that Fr will carry out their
                                obligations under Mar 8 agreements with such generosity and
                                expedition that impressively constructive atmosphere will be created
                                and that at same time Viet nationalists will rapidly appreciate true
                                character menace approaching from Chi and will prefer cooperate
                                Baodai solution rather than accept alternative continued resistance
                                and risk loss all real autonomy to Chi Commies. Presumably such
                                outcome not impossible particularly if Fr cld let it be understood
                                Baodai agreement does not permanently define status Vietnam but
                                provides basis for further early evolution.</p>

                            <p>Ambassador Bonnet asked me to lunch alone with him today “to renew
                                contact” following my return to the Department for duty. After <pb
                                    n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0045"/>a general dissertation on
                                internal political and economic conditions in France the Ambassador
                                changed the subject to Indochina, stating that he would be glad to
                                hear my views on the situation there.</p>
                            <p>I replied that having been in Belgium for the last nine months and
                                only having returned to the Department laist week I was not
                                conversant with the latest developments in Indochina, but that
                                nonetheless I would be very glad to give him my personal views on
                                this very critical subject and that I would speak with complete
                                frankness. I said that my impression, after having been in
                                Washington ten days, was that there is a strong current of informed
                                American opinion which believes that the French have in general
                                followed a policy of “too little and too late” in their dealings
                                with the Indochinese Nationalists and that specifically such
                                concessions as France finally made in the agreements of March 8,
                                1949 would probably not be enough to rally sufficient support for
                                Bao-Dai to enable him to successfully oppose the efforts of the Ho
                                Chi Minh faction from taking over the country. While this might well
                                be true, I realized that given the circumstances the French
                                Government would not reopen negotiations with Bao-Dai even if we
                                pressed them to do so, and therefore I would not argue the merits or
                                demerits of the March 8 Agreements. The point I did wish to make
                                very strongly was that in my opinion if the French did not rapidly
                                ratify the Agreements and then interpret and implement them in the
                                most liberal manner possible the Bao-Dai solution was doomed to
                                failure since at best his chances of success hardly appeared to be
                                50–50. The essential is, therefore, that the French move with all
                                possible speed to ratify the March 8 agreements and then act in such
                                a way that the Vietnam Nationalists may be persuaded that at last
                                France is embarking on a more liberal policy which holds the
                                possibility of further evolution.</p>
                            <p>I concluded by stating that I was concerned by the views held in
                                certain French circles that the United States would pour all sorts
                                of aid into Indochina at the last minute to prevent the country from
                                being taken over by the Communists. This view, together with another
                                idea held by certain French to the effect that possible future
                                military aid under the Military Assistance Program if voted would
                                enable France to try to seek a military solution against the
                                Vietnam, was both dangerous and fallacious.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Bonnet said that he was glad I had spoken to him so
                                frankly. He thought I might be unduly concerned about the French
                                dragging their feet on ratifying the March 8 agreements, since
                                during his recent visit to Paris he had been told that the
                                Government intended to move rapidly. He said that the successful
                                conclusion of the debate on Cochin-China indicated that the French
                                realized speed was essential.</p>
                            <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0046"/>
                            <p>I asked him if he had any information on when the Assembly would vote
                                on the March 8 Agreements. He replied in the negative but added that
                                he would send a telegram to Paris reiterating the urgency of the
                                matter and inquiring when Parliamentary action would be taken.</p>
                            <p>He concluded by saying that the United States and France had the same
                                interest in seeing that Indochina was not taken over by the
                                Communists; that the Bao-Dai solution was the only non-communist
                                solution in sight; and that therefore when the Agreements were
                                ratified he hoped not only that we would not criticize them “as this
                                would cut the ground from under Bao-Dai’s feet” but that eventually
                                we might “be able to do something” showing approval.</p>
                            <p>I replied that what we would or would not be able to do appeared to
                                depend almost entirely on the speed with which the French acted and
                                on their own efforts to strengthen Bao-Dai by a sincere,
                                far-reaching and liberal interpretation of the March 8
                                Agreements.</p>

                            <p>He stated implementation March 8 agreements has in fact already begun
                                and will proceed as rapidly as possible with step by step transfer
                                administration Vietnam to Bao Dai Government. Entire process to be
                                completed well before December 31 deadline.</p>
                            <p>Regarding ratification agreements, he expressed opinion, which he
                                says is widely shared in his Ministry, that agreements, which enter
                                into effect upon exchange instruments, will not be submitted
                                Assembly as such. Recalled that agreements were concluded with Bao
                                Dai as “most representative element Vietnam” but not as chief of
                                state. France therefore does not wish to “impose” them on Vietnam
                                before freely elected government established there. Following
                                formation such government, <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0047"

                                supplementary agreements envisaged thereunder would be signed
                                between Vietnam and France which, following Parliamentary
                                ratifications, would consitute “act” required Article 61
                                constitution establishing relations between France and Vietnam. In
                                this connection he added that while French commitments under March 8
                                agreements firm, agreement itself not static but subject enlargement
                                in light future developments. He believes final treaty will be
                                concluded within next six or seven months.</p>
                            <p>De Peyrera volunteered information that within next two or three
                                weeks France would approach friendly powers including US informing
                                them that while Vietnam temporarily accrediting missions only to
                                Siam, India, and Vatican, France would “welcome” decision other
                                nations to accredit missions to Vietnam. Juridical aspects

                                indicated to French their intention to send two special roving
                                missions (one to US and Western Europe and one to neighboring
                                countries) to announce Vietnam’s new international status and invite
                                recognition.</p>
                            <p>De Peyrera stated that Pignon’s telegrams reporting internal
                                situation Vietnam as developing more favorably than anticipated.
                                Expected Viet Minh attacks Tonkin had not developed and even
                                terrorist activities had fallen off. Pignon favorably impressed with
                                Bao Dai who is proceeding slowly and carefully with composition
                                government. De Peyrera stated that Bao Dai is in contact with
                                non-Communist elements Vietnam and hopes for their inclusion in
                                government. Despite recent “rumors” it was inconceivable that Bao
                                Dai would consider inclusion Communists, particularly such
                                conspicuous figures as Ho Chi Minh or Giap.<note n="3"

                                expressed doubts that Bao Dai has any intention leave Indochina
                                within next few months but considered possible that in perhaps six
                                or eight months after his government established as going concern he
                                might visit France “for a month or so.”</p>
                            <p>De Peyrera warned against expecting startling results in immediate
                                future but believes that within next two or three months it will be
                                evident whether or not Bao Dai solution will succeed or fail. He
                                stated Pignon and Ministry Overseas France at present more
                                optimistic than at any time previously.</p>

                                20 to Hanoi. French Government is of course acutely aware that Bao
                                Dai’s success will depend on ability his government obtain wide
                                popular support and to govern effectively. Embassy receives
                                impression, however, that Department convinced Bao Dai doomed to
                                failure unless further concessions obtained from French at this
                                time.</p>
                            <p>At risk being repetitious, Embassy wishes point out that March 8
                                agreements define limits of Vietnam’s “independence within French
                                Union.” Obviously these limits could not be broadened without
                                renegotiation March 8 agreements which embody maximum concessions
                                which Cabinet has been able to agree upon and which Queuille risked
                                his government to obtain. It was only with great difficulty that he
                                was able to persuade political parties forming coalition—notably the
                                Socialists—to approve action their members in Cabinet in accepting
                                March 8 agreements. Such approval was of course essential if
                                government was to obtain parliamentary support its Indochina policy
                                in form early approval. Change status Cochin China and ultimately

                            <p>Embassy believes, however, that March 8 agreements afford as much
                                room for satisfying Vietnamese aspirations self-rule and
                                international status as Vietnamese themselves are now able to cope

                                repeatedly informed by Bao Dai’s advisers that they are satisfied
                                Pignon will move forward rapidly in an honest and sincere
                                implementation of agreements. It is Embassy’s belief that French
                                Government will be guided by and support Pignon and is well ahead of
                                parliamentary thinking on evolution Vietnam. On the specific points

                                important policy statements all three cities. Composition government
                                may not be announced until June 15 or June 20. In the meanwhile
                                provisional government will have resigned and new government will
                                take over at Hanoi. Not clear whether new government will be
                                announced before trip or when he reaches Hanoi.</p>
                            <p>Regarding recognition, Foreign Office holds exchange instruments will
                                constitute France’s acknowledgement existence new state, but Auriol
                                will send message Bao Dai on date exchange. Foreign Office is

                            <p>After publication accords, current Foreign Office’s plan is to inform
                                foreign powers by note of coming into being new state together with
                                statement Vietnam’s ability to receive foreign diplomatic missions.
                                Foreign Office idea is that each foreign power in its reply (or
                                absence thereof) to note will indicate degree acceptance new status
                                Vietnam and its views regarding entering into formal relations
                                therewith.</p>
                            <p>Bao Dai will be chief of state not emperor or monarch pending popular
                                consultation. Bao Dai advises state government is to be clearly

                                national basis. It will be composed of representatives of all major
                                non-Viet Minh Nationalist groups but some important portfolios will
                                be in hands secretaries of state, thus leaving these ministerships
                                open to Nationalist elements now in Viet Minh.</p>
                            <p>Two close advisers of Bao Dai, who accompanied Buu Lee [<hi
                                    rend="italic">Loc</hi>] on his tour of Vietnam and have just
                                returned Paris, state that Bao Dai’s people have been in contact
                                with all major Nationalist groups and with certain non-Communist
                                elements Viet Minh. They report general acceptance of March 8
                                agreements (whose terms are better than offered Ho) on satisfactory
                                basis from which independent Vietnam can evolve. In Viet Minh
                                circles contacted, however, the expected skepticism exists as to
                                honest implementation agreement and positions <pb n="36"

                                of intention are confirmed by performance. Source said there would
                                be no “psychological shock” in Viet Minh territory. Only gradual
                                growth of pro-Bao Dai sentiment could be expected. What was
                                important was emphasis on factors which did not exist on other side
                                of lines. Transfer of administration from French to Viet hands,
                                although it would be closely scrutinized for French reneging, would
                                impress Viet Minh elements less than international status (not
                                possessed by Ho) granted Bao Dai government by agreements and degree
                                recognition accorded it by foreign government, particularly US.</p>
                            <p>Sources emphasized that this was one of principal psychological
                                factors on which Bao Dai counted in building his prestige throughout
                                Vietnam and an important element in stimulating defections from Viet
                                Minh particularly among educated elements whom he needs to swell
                                ranks of people capable to help him govern. Limitations on conduct
                                diplomatic relations provided in agreements were described by our

                                Bao Dai hoped the US could do for him and his new regime. Points in

                                    experiment in Indochina, creation of Vietnam as associated state

                                    sovereignty is important event in development and evolution
                                    France’s relations with its far-flung and widely variegated
                                    dependent peoples. It is first major step taken by France in
                                    recognition of native nationalism to give autonomous status and
                                    international standing other than purely nominal to overseas
                                    territory. As such it is milepost and measure of France’s
                                    willingness to implement principles of French Union. While
                                    conception underlying these principles contemplates closer
                                    control by Metro-pole in such matters as foreign relations and

                                    dependent territories, particularly Tunisia and Morocco. While
                                    implementation for latter will be slower developing and
                                    different in degree, Vietnam accords may be expected have
                                    considerable influence both on Nationalist movements these areas
                                    and French thinking regarding them. The new Vietnam, even though
                                    created under extreme pressure events, represents maximum to

                                    Dai or new government. Neither French nor Vietnamese with whom
                                    we have talked expect major powers to rush into any overall

                                    and given some signs of viability and public support. Bao Dai’s

                                    past months emphasized to us, however, the great weight which
                                    some degree of international acknowledgment of new state’s

                            <p>2308. Today’s press carries text Auriol message to Bao Dai informing
                                him of promulgation of law for union Cochin-China with Vietnam.
                                “France has thus carried out its commitments; independence and unity
                                Vietnam within French union have become a reality”.</p>
                            <p>Message states March 8 agreements will enter into effect following
                                “imminent” exchange of instruments at Saigon and will be published
                                in their entirety immediately thereafter. As Viet national
                                aspirations satisfied and way now clear for reestablishment peace,
                                Auriol requests Bao Dai, as soon as he shall have constituted the
                                government of “new state”, to choose immediately Viet diplomats
                                foreseen in agreements in order that they may be jointly accredited
                                to interested states. Message concludes that as soon as Bao Dai
                                shall have appealed to all spiritual and political groups to
                                collaborate in rebirth Vietnam and that appeal shall have restored
                                peace, he, Auriol, in agreement with Bao Dai and Vietnam law, is
                                prepared either to grant broad pardons for offenses and crimes
                                committed during last unhappy years or in the same spirit to grant
                                wide amnesty to bring about a fraternal reconciliation and to
                                contribute to a sound peace and a growing prosperity in Vietnam.</p>

                            <p>It is suggested that the Embassy’s note transmitting the memorandum
                                be composed along the following lines:</p>

                                <p>The Government of the United States is most appreciative of the
                                    action of the French Government in making available to it the
                                    text of the agreement concluded on March 8 between the President
                                    of France and the former Emperor of Annam defining the future
                                    status of the State of Vietnam. The agreement has been studied
                                    with the greatest interest by the Department of State.</p>
                                <p>As the French Government is aware, the United States Government
                                    has followed with some concern the course of events in French
                                    Indochina since the end of the war in the Pacific. This concern,
                                    it is needless to say, has been prompted by a realization that
                                    the forces which have contributed predominantly to the character
                                    of the Vietnamese nationalist movement are manifestations of the
                                    same forces which have worked profound changes in southern Asia
                                    generally and that the outcome of these forces can be of
                                    considerable consequence for the world in general.</p>
                                <p>When at the end of the war it became evident that in most of the
                                    dependent countries of southern Asia the indigenous peoples were
                                        <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0054"/>determined to control
                                    their own destinies in the future, the United States Government
                                    ventured to hope that the western nations would appreciate the
                                    strength of this resolution and willingly grant the essential
                                    demands of the nationalist movements. It was believed that in so
                                    doing, the metropolitan powers would be yielding what in any
                                    case they could expect to hold only by military force at great
                                    cost. In such event it seemed probable that the costs to the
                                    Metropolitan Government would be unrecoverable and the value of
                                    the colony and its possible contribution to world stability
                                    would be reduced by the ensuant hostilities. On the other hand
                                    it was believed that by promptly offering the necessary
                                    political concessions to the nationalist demands the
                                    metropolitan power would be adopting the course most likely to
                                    result in a continued close and mutually fruitful relationship
                                    with the former colony, in the preservation of patterns of trade
                                    and economy long intermeshed, and in a readiness on the part of
                                    the colonial people to welcome the continued technical and
                                    administrative assistance of the metropolitan power. It appeared
                                    that only on such a basis would there be any real hope that the
                                    Western powers could retain their legitimate interests in the
                                    countries so closely associated with them over such long
                                    periods, and that among the new nations of southern Asia
                                    conditions of political stability and of freedom of political
                                    and economic development could be achieved enabling them to
                                    realize their potentialities and make their full contribution to
                                    the world.</p>
                                <p>Conversely, it seemed that an intention on the part of the
                                    metropolitan power to retain an authority which the dependent
                                    people was determined to exercise itself could result only in
                                    turning the nationalist movement into destructive channels. In
                                    these circumstances it could be expected that widespread
                                    hostilities would result and that the consequent destruction of
                                    the facilities of production in the dependent area would cause
                                    economic setbacks seriously injurious to both peoples.
                                    Furthermore, it could be anticipated that the nationalist forces
                                    would turn increasingly to an uncompromising leadership which
                                    would react against cooperation with the West and against those
                                    free institutions which European civilization has evolved
                                    through long experience in self-government.</p>
                                <p>Events in southern Asia in the past four years have caused no
                                    revision of these views; and it is in the light of this estimate
                                    that the United States Government has examined the agreement of
                                    March 8 and offers its views.</p>
                                <p>Because of its conviction that concessions by France to the
                                    Nationalist movement commensurate with the strength of that
                                    movement can alone provide the basis for a resolution of the
                                    Indochinese situation and the creation of a stable,
                                    representative Vietnamese Government, the United States
                                    Government welcomes the step taken <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41"
                                        facs="0055"/>by the President of France in arriving at an
                                    agreement with ex-Emperor Bao Dai whereby the territorial unity
                                    of Vietnam, comprising Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, may be
                                    realized and the Vietnamese State enjoy far-reaching powers of
                                    internal autonomy. It may be stated at once that in the opinion
                                    of the United States Government the Vietnamese people would be
                                    guilty of a mistake disastrous to their future should they
                                    reject this solution and give their support not to the
                                    Vietnamese Government formed under the March 8 agreement but to
                                    the so-called Democratic Republic of Vietnam. For those in
                                    command of this Republic are men trained in the methods and
                                    doctrine of international communism, and regardless of their
                                    present espousal of the nationalist cause, it cannot be ignored
                                    that they have never disavowed their Kremlin connections or
                                    repudiated the techniques and objectives of communism, which are
                                    the cause of so much suffering in the world today. It must be
                                    assumed, therefore, that should their government succeed in its
                                    aims with the support or through the acquiescence of the
                                    Vietnamese people, the pattern of a foreign totalitarianism will
                                    be clamped upon Vietnam under which all liberties, national and
                                    personal, will be lost. Such an outcome would not only be fatal
                                    to the welfare and hopes of the Vietnamese but would be most
                                    detrimental to the interests of all free peoples, particularly
                                    those of southern Asia who stand in most immediate danger of
                                    further Communist aggression.</p>
                                <p>However, the United States Government does not feel confident
                                    that the Vietnamese people in general will see the choice
                                    confronting them in these terms, especially in view of the
                                    isolating factors in their situation during most of the past
                                    decade. The Vietnamese nationalists who for the most part have
                                    been supporting the so-called Democratic Republic of Vietnam as
                                    the one agency which appeared to promise independence may not,
                                    it is feared, find the provisions of the March 8 agreement
                                    entirely appealing. In this connection, it should be pointed out
                                    that the United States Government is considering only this
                                    agreement since it is not familiar with the contents of any
                                    associated documents which may bear upon the matter and does not
                                    know whether the March 8 agreement is intended to define the
                                    status of Vietnam permanently or to provide a basis for the
                                    further early evolution of the Vietnamese State.</p>
                                <p>The United States Government is inclined to believe that one of
                                    the strongest motivating forces behind nationalist movements
                                    among dependent peoples is resentment of the imputation of
                                    inferiority implicit in a subordinate status. When a people has
                                    fought for the goal of independence with such tenacity as that
                                    displayed by the Vietnamese resistance forces, it appears
                                    unlikely that it will be content with a position of anything
                                    less than equality with other peoples. It is feared that the <pb
                                        n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0056"/>concessions granted by
                                    the French Government may be obscured in the eyes of the
                                    Vietnamese by those terms of the agreement which are
                                    incompatible with Vietnamese national pride.</p>
                                <p>Should such feelings determine the reaction of the majority of
                                    Vietnamese to a Government formed under the March 8 agreement,
                                    then it must be supposed that the Communist-dominated
                                    “Democratic Republic of Vietnam” will continue to receive the
                                    support of these Vietnamese. Certainly as long as the Vietnamese
                                    are persuaded that the two-and-a-half-year-old war with France
                                    must be prosecuted to a conclusion if the goals for which they
                                    have fought are to be won, they will continue to regard the
                                    dominant Communist element of the Viet-minh League in the light
                                    of its effective leadership of the nationalist movement and not
                                    of its inevitable intention to subvert the nationalist cause in
                                    the end to the requirements of international Communism, with
                                    which they have had little acquaintance as yet.</p>
                                <p>The United States Government would be lacking in frankness if it
                                    did not state that in its considered estimation the paramount
                                    question in Indochina now is whether the country is to be saved
                                    from Communist control. Under the circumstances, all other
                                    issues must be regarded as irrelevant. Much time has already
                                    been lost. The years since the end of the Pacific War have seen
                                    the Communist threat to Indochina intensified rather than
                                    otherwise. The southward progress of Chinese Communist armies
                                    toward the northern frontier of Indochina introduces a new
                                    element that transforms an already serious situation into an
                                    emergency.</p>
                                <p>As it has made clear in the past, the United States Government is
                                    of the opinion that it must prove difficult to save this
                                    situation and to preserve Indochina from a foreign tyranny
                                    unless the French Government offers the Vietnamese the
                                    attainment of those nationalist goals which they would continue
                                    to fight for rather than forego and unless the Vietnamese can be
                                    convinced that they can, in fact, fully realize their patriotic
                                    aims through cooperation with the Government envisaged in the
                                    March 8 agreement. In its view, developments have reduced the
                                    choice in Indochina to simple alternatives: will Vietnam achieve
                                    independence through an agreement with France and with the
                                    assistance of France and maintain this independence fortified by
                                    collaboration with France, or will it achieve independence from
                                    France while at the same time falling victim to Communist
                                    totalitarianism?</p>
                                <p>The United States Government believes that the Vietnamese will
                                    willingly accept a partnership with France only if the equality
                                    of Vietnam is recognized and if, as a prior condition to the
                                    determination of the character of this relationship, the
                                    sovereignty of Vietnam is acknowledged. Observation of
                                    developments in southern Asia since the end of the war would
                                    seem to leave little doubt that a Union between <pb n="43"
                                        xml:id="pg_43" facs="0057"/>France and Vietnam would be far
                                    more likely of attainment and would prove more fruitful and
                                    enduring if attained were the Union conceived not as an
                                    instrument for the control of one member by the other but as an
                                    agency of cooperation in fields of common interest, diplomatic,
                                    military, economic, and cultural, voluntarily espoused on both
                                    sides.</p>
                                <p>An approach to the future on these lines would appear to offer
                                    the greatest hope that French influence in Indochina may be
                                    preserved, which must be regarded as unquestionably to the best
                                    interests of the Indochinese, and that military and naval bases
                                    in Vietnam may be retained by France and French economic rights
                                    be assured. By adopting this course the metropolitan country
                                    would appear to have little to lose and much to gain. Moreover,
                                    from a strictly practical point of view, the United States
                                    Government has been impressed by the difficulties likely to
                                    arise if in transferring autonomous powers to the government of
                                    a dependent territory the metropolitan power seeks, as a
                                    condition to such transfer, to subdivide sovereignty in the area
                                    by retaining certain transcendant rights to itself. For in this
                                    case the question of the precise division of authority is prone
                                    to present itself in connection with every field of government
                                    as the process of transfer is planned. In consequence, the
                                    prestige and good will which should accrue to the metropolitan
                                    power from its acceptance of a new order is likely to be
                                    dissipated in an atmosphere of discord and mistrust, as
                                    suspicion grows among the nationalists that the metropolitan
                                    power is in fact seeking to perpetuate its existing controls. In
                                    consequence the process of giving definition to the new order
                                    and establishing it in practice may be indefinitely protracted,
                                    with results which may defeat the enterprise.</p>
                                <p>A dispassionate appraisal leads the United States Government to
                                    believe, in short, that the preservation of Indochina’s
                                    integrity depends, in the first place, upon the willingness of
                                    the metropolitan country to give assurances that Vietnam is to
                                    exercise control of its destinies; that its participation in the
                                    French Union will be upon terms freely accepted by
                                    representatives enjoying the confidence of the Vietnamese people
                                    when these shall have been assembled; that the powers of
                                    administration exercised by France in Vietnam will be
                                    transferred to the Vietnamese as soon as conditions permit the
                                    institution and functioning of the new regime; and that the
                                    deployment of French forces in Vietnam outside their bases is to
                                    be accounted for in terms of the defense of Vietnam against the
                                    protagonists of a supranational totalitarianism who would
                                    surrender Vietnam to alien controls.</p>
                                <p>In the second place, much would appear to depend upon the
                                    readiness of the heads of the Vietnamese Government formed under
                                    the <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0058"/>March 8 agreement to
                                    invite the participation in this Government of bonafide and
                                    truly nationalist leaders of Vietnam, including those who have
                                    heretofore supported the “Democratic Republic of Vietnam”, to
                                    the end that this Government may provide dynamic leadership and
                                    obtain the confidence of the nationalist elements comprising the
                                    major part of the resistance forces.</p>
                                <p>Such an approach to the problem would best appear to lay the
                                    basis for the clear separation of nationalists from Communist
                                    elements in Vietnam; for those who persisted in resisting a
                                    Vietnamese Government through which all nationalist aims could
                                    be realized in favor of continued adherence to the “Democratic
                                    Republic of Vietnam” would in effect be acknowledging that their
                                    goals were not nationalist but Communist. The achievement of
                                    this distinction would appear to be the <hi rend="italic">sine
                                        qua non</hi> of a solution of the Indochina problem.</p>
                                <p>Having demonstrated its capacity to rally the nationalist
                                    majority of Vietnamese to its support, the Government formed
                                    under the March 8 agreement would—it would seem to the United
                                    States Government have grounds for appealing for the support of
                                    all free nations. The United States Government would hope that
                                    this appeal would be generally heeded, especially by the other
                                    Governments of southern Asia which, themselves having every
                                    reason to regard the further extension of Communist controls in
                                    the region with alarm, could fill a vitally important role by
                                    clarifying for the Vietnamese people the issues confronting them
                                    on the basis of their own experience and undoubted fidelity to
                                    the cause of self-determination by the Asian peoples.</p>
                                <p>The United States Government is, however, convinced that if the
                                    requisite concessions by the French Government to the
                                    nationalist demands are not forthcoming, the task of the
                                    Government envisaged in the March 8 agreement must prove most
                                    difficult of accomplishment and the countries adjacent to
                                    Indochina will most likely be confronted by the prospect of the
                                    appearance of sizable Communist-controlled forces on their
                                    frontiers.</p>
                                <p>It goes without saying that the earnest hope of the United States
                                    Government is that the Government formed under the March 8
                                    agreement will succeed in its crucial task. At the same time it
                                    would appear axiomatic that insofar as the probabilities of its
                                    success are related to the extent of international support it
                                    obtains, the decision of a third party in respect of the
                                    feasibility of its extending support or assistance must be
                                    governed by the extent to which the French Government has itself
                                    provided that Government with the political advantages upon
                                    which its appeal to the Vietnamese must be based. Clearly the
                                    success of this Government must rest in the first instance upon
                                    those means of accomplishing its purpose which only the French
                                    Government can provide.</p>

                                <p>In taking advantage of the relations of cordiality and mutual
                                    understanding it enjoys with the French Government by offering
                                    this frank appraisal, the United States Government has been
                                    prompted only by the thought that it should not leave the
                                    direction of its thinking a matter of doubt and that an exchange
                                    of views might be advantageous considering all that is involved
                                    in the outcome of the situation in Indochina.</p>

                                taken by both French and Bao Dai.</p>
                            <p>Prolonged delay will also be interpreted by many as sign that US sees

                                in Communist sphere. Effect of this on non-Communist nationalists
                                weighing pros and cons of throwing their lot in with Bao Dai can be
                                imagined.</p>

                                prepared to issue a favorable statement regarding the new regime, it
                                is suggested it include friendly mention of Bao Dai in his capacity
                                as mediator between all truly nationalist and non-Communist
                                elements. Recent developments emphasize importance of building up

                            <p>It is believed that Bao Dai’s message to people planned for June 13

                            <p>2430. Department’s Instruction 289, June 6. The following are my
                                considered views. We are unanimous in thinking it would be a serious
                                    <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0060"/>mistake to deliver
                                Department’s memorandum. The Secretary has read both the memorandum
                                and my reply which follows and concurs with us that the delivery of
                                such views as expressed by the Department would at this time be
                                inappropriate.</p>
                            <p>Embassy has attentively and exhaustively considered memorandum
                                enclosed Department’s instruction 289 and has reached conclusion
                                that while it is an excellent summary of Department’s thinking on
                                latter-day aspects of colonial problem and its relationship both to
                                strong current of nationalism in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                                and to latter’s tragic corollary of Communism, its presentation to
                                French officials at this time would impede rather than encourage
                                achievement by French of Department’s desiderata.</p>
                            <p>Members of Cabinet and other French officials concerned with
                                formulation of Indochina policy are battered and bruised by the long
                                struggle against prejudice, self-interest and political opportunism
                                from which they have emerged with a partial triumph embodied in
                                March 8 agreements and passage of Cochin-China bill. While many of
                                them have their doubts, as has the Department, as to whether the
                                March 8 agreements are entirely adequate or whether Bao Dai has
                                astuteness and ability necessary for success, they are equally aware
                                that there is no present alternative to them and that they must live
                                with the document and with the man throughout the early phases of
                                the experiment. In their eyes Department’s memorandum would
                                constitute not only a discouraging document in that it unfavorably
                                prejudges outcome of an experiment which has not yet got off to fair
                                start and implies that US will support it only in unlikely event
                                that it succeeds, but also an unrealistic document in that its
                                references to further concessions suggests that March 8 agreements
                                be renegotiated. (In this connection please see <gloss
                                    target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2189, May 30 explaining why
                                March 8 agreements cannot be renegotiated.) Under the circumstances
                                effect produced on these officials would be opposite of constructive
                                at time when their best efforts are required to help Bao Dai
                                experiment succeed.</p>
                            <p>For the above reasons I strongly urge that I be authorized to give
                                the French orally a resume of the Department’s general views on
                                problem as a whole as contained in first four and half pages of

                                suggested that if I wished to see Bao Dai he thought interview could
                                be arranged Wednesday morning. In view of Department’s instructions
                                regarding any premature action indicating recognition, I replied
                                that it would seem more appropriate if I had informal conversation
                                with Prince Buuloc.</p>
                            <p>Later Diplomatic Counsellor Dugardier said he had heard of above
                                approach and Pignon had no objection my seeing Bao Dai. Still later
                                Dugardier again approached me and said he felt I should see Bao
                                Dai.</p>

                                receipt of the Department’s Instruction No. 27 of April 22, 1949,
                                which has recently been received, transmitting a copy of a
                                memorandum on Southeast Asia dated April 2, 1949, left with the
                                Secretary by the British Foreign Minister, Mr. Ernest Bevin, during
                                his recent visit to the United States.<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1"

                            </p>
                            <p>I have read the British memorandum with great interest. I believe
                                that the analysis of the situation contained therein is sound and
                                that the British approach to this problem as outlined in the
                                memorandum displays a clear appreciation of the dangers of the
                                spread of Communism throughout Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the
                                suggestions advanced to contain Communism in this part of the world
                                appear to me to be thoroughly realistic. I might mention that the
                                views expressed by the British Government closely parallel our own
                                estimate of the situation of which the Department has been made
                                cognizant through our despatches, policy suggestions, and
                                telegrams.</p>
                            <p>There are two points made in the British memorandum which I feel are
                                vital to this whole problem and which I am therefore commenting upon
                                at the risk of being repetitious. I have reference firstly to the
                                statement appearing in the opening paragraph of the British
                                memorandum that if the general impression prevails in Southeast Asia
                                that the Western powers are both unwilling and unable to assist in
                                resisting Soviet pressure, the psychological effect may be that
                                local resistance <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0065"/>is weakened
                                with the result that the undermining of the Governments of that
                                region will succeed and that eventually the whole of Southeast Asia
                                will fall a victim to the Communist advance, thus coming under
                                Russian domination without any military effort on the part of
                                Russia. The significance of this statement regarding the
                                psychological attitude and feeling on the part of the peoples of
                                Southeast Asia generally, and of Thailand in particular, is
                                constantly being impressed upon me and my staff. With the sweep of
                                Communist forces through China and their rapid approach to the
                                southern borders of that country, government officials and educated
                                Thai have become increasingly uneasy over the future of their
                                country. Many of them unfortunately do not have any very clear
                                conception of the ruthless policies and objectives of Communism or
                                what this would mean to Thailand and the Thai people if a Communist
                                regime were to be established here. There is great need to bring
                                home to the people the dangers of Communism. As reported to the
                                Department from time to time there is among some Thai a feeling of
                                fatalism and a resignation to the fact that Thailand in the not too
                                distant future will be confronted by a powerful force which she
                                alone is unable to cope with. In these circumstances there is a
                                natural disposition and tendency for the Thai people to look to the
                                Western powers, particularly the United States and Great Britain,
                                whom they know are opposed to the spread of militant Communism, for
                                help and assistance. It is for this reason that any statements or
                                developments concerning the Far East and this part of the world are
                                examined and weighed rather seriously by influential Thai. What they
                                have thus far observed has not reassured them but, on the contrary,
                                has caused them to believe that the United States in particular is
                                not seriously interested in the future of Thailand. I have reference
                                to the following series of events, namely, the statements attributed
                                to former Secretary of War, Mr. Royall,<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2"

                                    29, 1949, p. 696.</note> While we have done what we could to
                                counter this general impression of lack of United States interest in
                                the fate of Thailand because of our preoccupation with the European
                                situation, we have not been in a position to point either privately
                                or publicly to any specific statement of policy with regard to this
                                part of the world, to any authorized official approach to the Thai
                                Government concerning <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0066"/>the
                                problem of Communism and ways and means of meeting that problem, or
                                to any concrete measures of technical or other assistance actually
                                extended to the Thai people. The psychological effect of the ominous
                                developments in China coupled with our seeming unwillingness and/or
                                inability to assist the Thai people at this critical juncture in
                                their history, is, I fear, likely to have precisely the reaction
                                foreseen and to result in the commencement of a process of weakening
                                the will of the Government and people to resist.</p>
                            <p>It can be argued that the Thai, in full realization of the dangers of
                                Communism to the liberties of their people and the freedom and
                                sovereign integrity of their country, should depend upon themselves
                                and their own resources to resist the menace which threatens them. I
                                believe that to a certain extent the Thai people can and will resist
                                the seizure of their country by the Communists but historically and
                                by tempera ment they have tended to bow to force which they regard
                                as overwhelming and against which they feel they cannot count on
                                outside aid and assistance. I think I can safely say, therefore, in
                                the absence of either a policy statement regarding Southeast Asia or
                                some concrete evidence of our intention to assist the Siamese that
                                psychologically they are allowing themselves to think in terms of
                                acquiescence to Communism when serious pressure is applied.</p>
                            <p>The second point in the British memorandum which I feel deserves
                                special comment, has reference to the desirability of taking steps
                                to “stiffen the will to resist” on the part of Southeast Asian
                                countries, simultaneously with our efforts to strengthen the
                                defensive position of Europe and the Middle East. This is precisely
                                in line with our thinking as set forth in various telegrams and our
                                Despatch No. 35 of February 10, 1949,<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Not
                                    printed.</note> forwarding certain policy suggestions regarding
                                Thailand which were prepared for the Foreign Service Regional
                                Conference held in April of this year at New Delhi.</p>
                            <p>I feel that the phrase “to stiffen the will to resist” very aptly and
                                accurately describes precisely what I believe we should seek to
                                achieve without too deeply committing ourselves politically or
                                financially. It is obvious that we do not, at this juncture, wish to
                                bind ourselves by an agreement which would commit us to defend
                                Thailand from a Communist attack and guarantee the sovereignty and
                                independence of the country. I do not believe that such extensive
                                commitments are necessary. I believe that the issuance of a
                                carefully worded policy statement clearly emphasizing our desire to
                                assist in the problems of rehabilitation which face the country in
                                order that Thailand might achieve both economic and political
                                strength sufficient to ward off the dangers of Communism or other
                                threats to her sovereignty and independence, would have a very
                                beneficial effect upon the general morale of the Government <pb
                                    n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0067"/>and people and would in
                                effect “stiffen the will to resist”. Such a statement, perhaps made
                                in conjunction with the British, should enumerate the aid we propose
                                to extend in the technical fields, the supply of a modest amount of
                                military aid and equipment and the implementation of the other
                                recommendations set forth in our despatch No. 35 of February 10,
                                1949. I believe such a statement would create in the minds of the
                                Thai people the reassuring feeling that they are not without outside
                                friends to give them some measure of support against the powerful
                                menace of Communism.</p>
                            <p>Finally, may I say that while our commitments designed to stem
                                Communism in Europe and the Middle East are tremendous, we cannot
                                afford to close our eyes to the equally tremendous gains made by
                                Communism in China and the Far East or to the fact that a wholly
                                Communist dominated Asia constitutes an extremely serious threat to
                                the economy of Europe, our peace and the peace of the world. The
                                grouping together of the nations of Southern and Southeastern Asia
                                in a common and solid front against Communism, as hoped for by the
                                British, would be a most desirable development. However, such a
                                development is problematical and not likely in the immediate future.
                                The only desirable alternative is the adoption by these countries,
                                on an individual basis, of measures to resist Communist pressure. We
                                can, and I believe we should, encourage the adoption of such
                                measures by judicious extension of modest aid particularly to a
                                small country such as Thailand which looks for reassurance from the
                                friendly powers that in standing against Communism it is not
                                standing alone. I believe further that in extending aid to Thailand
                                there is reasonable prospect of such aid achieving what we hope it
                                will achieve and that the withholding of aid is likely to have only
                                one result—namely, a fatalistic acquiescence to Communist
                                domination.</p>

                                Bao Dai privately yesterday connection special reception for
                                Chinese, Indian, Pakistan colonies which Hopson attended as
                                representative Pakistan interests.</p>
                            <p>Prince Buuloc stated Emperor attaches great importance his two
                                speeches yesterday (mytel 193 June 14). They should be considered as
                                complementary, first speech as announcement foreign policy, second
                                outlining internal policy. Prince drew attention to sentence quoted
                                third paragraph mytel 193 which Emperor considers form slanderence

                                journalists. Second speech pledges Emperor to democratic, socially
                                liberal internal regime. Subsequent speeches Hue [and] Hanoi will
                                supplement and expand above themes.</p>
                            <p>Prince expressed hope Britain and US would issue friendly welcoming

                            <p>697. (1) I had long talk with Bajpai<note n="1" xml:id="d51fn1">Sir
                                    Girja Shankar Bajpai, Secretary-General of the Indian Ministry
                                    of External Affairs.</note> afternoon June 20 regarding Vietnam.
                                I told him frankly your hopes and concern and stressed that failure
                                new regime obtain wide support people of country would almost
                                inevitably result in eventual Communist conquest. Communist control
                                would open way for Communists to Siam and other southern Asian
                                areas. I handed him latest available draft our proposed announcement
                                and said my government sincerely hoped, in view all circumstances,
                                responsible Indian leaders would not for time being make any
                                statements or take any action which would make more difficult
                                success new regime. I said we realized unless French could by acts
                                convince nationalist majority Vietnam that requisite concessions
                                would be forthcoming, present experiment would fail. We were hoping
                                enlightened policy on part of French and Bao Dai would gain support
                                of real nationalists and separate them from present Communist

                                        action regarding present situation Vietnam. An announcement
                                        might of course result raise inquiries which must be

                                        contained in our proposed announcement would not appeal to
                                        Indian public since British in their documents 30 years ago
                                        continually used expressions like “progressive steps
                                        direction self-government.” There was feeling in India use
                                        word “progressive” by colonial powers, unaccompanied by
                                        listing of measures and dates, was a rather worn device for

                            <p>(3) I referred to elections yesterday in Chandernagore and asked if
                                relations with French had improved. He replied affirmatively, but
                                said French colonial office was nevertheless backward and stubborn.
                                India sincerely wished to maintain good relations with French.
                                However, no Indian Government could afford, for internal or external
                                reasons, take any action which might be interpreted as supporting
                                continued control by colonial powers of Asian peoples.</p>

                                it would make a public statement of its own which would offer some
                                encouragement and express sympathetic interest in the success of the

                                them and were especially encouraged by one provision that France
                                would propose the newly formed state of Viet Nam for membership in
                                the United Nations. He assured me that he would convey the
                                information to his government but made it clear that he was
                                uncertain whether his government would be willing to take a public

                                    Xuan<note n="1" xml:id="d53fn1">General Xuan’s government had
                                    resigned as of June 20 but had been requested by Bao Dai to
                                    carry on until formation of a new cabinet. On July 1 Bao Dai
                                    issued a proclamation naming General Xuan as his deputy and
                                    Minister of National Defense and added: “As soon as the people
                                    are in a position to express their will freely, the accords of
                                    March 8, signed in Paris with President Auriol, will be
                                    submitted to them for their approval, and the people will decide

                                consultative powers, a sort of Senate paralleling the future

                                be several under secretariats of state which may be transformed into
                                ministries following the rallying of leaders still in the

                                Govt that Mar 8 agreement will be starting point for progressive
                                realization legit aspirations Vietnamese and (2) that continuing
                                statesmanship on part French will induce acceleration this
                                development.</p>
                            <p>Foregoing clarification believed desirable as Pignon’s reply under

                                in itself whereas in US views that agreement, tho creating partial
                                basis for future Vietnam independence, is but step toward solution
                                Vietnam problem. In <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s thinking
                                French in course of time will find it not only politically
                                advantageous but also necessary and possible to move far beyond
                                concessions contained in Mar 8 agreement to accommodate fundamental
                                nationalist aspirations Vietnamese. <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss> believes suspicions of French intentions, voiced
                                in many quarters, may be removed by rapid and liberal implementation
                                of that agreement and by generous attitude and speedy evolution in
                                future negotiations envisaged under that agreement.</p>
                            <p>In ur discretion you may add that in above connection certain other
                                interested govts (<gloss target="#t_urinfo1">urinfo</gloss> only
                                India and Thailand) save Brit seem to regard Mar 8 agreement as
                                cloak for continued French domination Indochina and consider Bao Dai
                                as puppet without a present substantial following. Under such
                                circumstances burden of proof rests mainly upon French to convince
                                not only Vietnamese but also other govts of their good
                                intentions.</p>

                            <p>2709. I had long conversation with Schuman yesterday re Indochina.
                                After giving him in detail views contained in first four and half
                                pages of Department’s memo (<gloss target="#t_Depins1"
                                    >Depins</gloss> 289, June 6), I went on to say that in case of
                                Vietnam, US Government, without at this time offering comment on
                                March 8 agreements, believes Vietnamese would commit serious mistake
                                should they reject possibility of solution offered by those
                                agreements and give their support not to government formed under
                                them but to so-called Democratic Republic Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>In furtherance this view US has given public welcome to formation new
                                unified Vietnamese state and has expressed hope March 8 agreements
                                would form basis for early realization legitimate aspirations
                                Vietnamese people. I told Schuman US is, however, of firm opinion
                                realization these goals would be most difficult of accomplishment in
                                association with French Union should government-envisaged March 8
                                agreements fail to obtain support of truly national elements
                                Vietnam. Our recent experience in China had given us abundant proof
                                of fact no amount of moral and material aid can save government
                                isolated from contact with its people and enjoying little popular
                                support. US Government, therefore, of opinion that in absence
                                definite schedule outlining successive steps of Vietnam’s evolution
                                towards independence, ability of new Vietnamese Government to
                                attract popular support will, in overwhelming measure, depend on
                                most liberal interpretation and implementation of agreements already
                                reached and on similarly generous attitude in negotiation of various
                                agreements remaining to be completed.</p>
                            <p>Insofar as success of government formed under March 8 agreemnts
                                related to extent international support which it receives, US
                                considers determining factor will be attitude towards new Vietnamese
                                Government adopted by other nations <gloss target="#t_SEA1"
                                    >SEA</gloss>, many of which have, themselves, only recently
                                emerged as independent states and who, if persuaded Vietnamese
                                people will be given full measure self-government in near future,
                                will be inclined not only grant new government moral status which in
                                Asian eyes cannot be achieved by Western recognition alone, but also
                                to enter into fruitful association with it, looking forward to
                                solution grim common problem now facing all South Asian
                                Governments.</p>
                            <p>I informed Schuman that in light foregoing, US feels that its future
                                attitude must depend largely on those developments Vietnam which
                                will determine popular support and authority of new Vietnamese
                                Government and on standing it achieves with neighboring <pb n="66"
                                    xml:id="pg_66" facs="0080"/>governments. US of opinion attitude
                                adopted by French Government will be major controlling factor this
                                development and therefore urges bold and rapid implementation and
                                interpretation March 8 agreements with view affording new Vietnamese
                                Government maximum possibilities for realization of legitimate
                                aspirations Vietnamese populations.</p>
                            <p>In conversation which followed I emphasized that there appeared to be
                                two major elements essential to success Bao Dai experiment. First
                                was internal and involved assuring new Vietnamese Government maximum
                                opportunities obtain popular support. This was directly dependent on
                                liberal and enlightened French policy in rapid implementation of
                                March 8 agreements. Second was external and depended largely on

                                    >SEA</gloss> adopted towards new Vietnamese Government. Schuman
                                replied that Assembly debates on Indochina and March 8 agreements
                                marked successful realization of great step forward in evolution
                                French policy in Indochina and assured me that French Government
                                would implement this policy by most liberal interpretation and
                                implementation of agreements. In this connection he remarked that
                                for execution of its policy, France had in Pignon very able man of
                                liberal school and moreover, General Revers had informed
                                him—Schuman—that he had given categoric instructions to French
                                military authorities in Indochina to give Pignon their full
                                cooperation and support. Re neighboring countries <gloss

                            <p>221. In private conversation with Dugardier some days ago said I had
                                just finished reading text of March 8 agreements and was somewhat
                                astonished and worried by certain provisions particularly in Section
                                Two on diplomatic questions.</p>
                            <p>There did not seem to be a single right accorded Vietnam which was
                                not limited some way to requirement for approval or consultation
                                with French. What worried me I explained was that when the time came
                                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0082"/>for presenting the
                                Vietnam for membership in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> our
                                experts might feel that under the terms of the March 8 agreements
                                the Vietnam had little if any diplomatic independence and would have
                                difficulty in finding grounds for our support for its application. I
                                emphasized these were my own personal views and were expressed
                                without consultation with or instructions from Department. Dugardier
                                replied that also speaking personally he could say that both he and
                                Pignon realized that many of the diplomatic clauses were politically
                                unwise and unenforceable and believed that Pignon did not intend to
                                try to apply them. Dugardier said that it was his understanding (he
                                was not present during the negotiations) that the present text did
                                not represent Foreign Office views and that most restrictive clauses
                                inserted at express demand Ministry Overseas France. He hinted
                                strongly that he felt Quai d’Orsay would not resent expression
                                American views along above lines particularly <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> angle.</p>
                            <p>Dugardier then mentioned again importance of removing <gloss

                                France. Said General Revers strongly agrees and has recommended that

                                cannot be given to Quai d’Orsay it must at least be placed directly

                            <p>3037. I had Pignon to lunch yesterday and he discussed developments
                                    <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China most frankly. He
                                remains optimistic and believes given necessary time Bao Dai
                                “solution” has good chance of success. He was particularly pleased
                                with Bao Dai’s reception at Hue and Hanoi which will strengthen
                                latter’s personal prestige and authority.</p>
                            <p>He outlined 3 essentials for success, first being continuity in
                                French Govt’s <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China policy and
                                exercise of wisdom and liberality in its implementation. Second is
                                Bao Dai’s ability to discipline members his govt and persuade them
                                to subordinate their personal and regional interests to national
                                welfare. He considers, as individuals, they are “on par with those
                                in Viet-Minh” but lack discipline and will have to learn to work as
                                a team. Third and unknown factor depends on developments China,
                                particularly Mao Tse-tung’s actions once his army reaches Tonkin
                                border.</p>
                            <p>In this latter respect he echoed Revers’ opinion French able cope
                                with anything short of all-out invasion of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"

                                participating in military operations with French army constitute
                                satisfactory nucleus for formation Vietnam army which will be
                                responsible for policing of Annam and Cochin China, freeing bulk of
                                expeditionary force for operations in Tonkin.</p>
                            <p>Felt Viets capable filling this role, pointing out Viet-Minh forces
                                not effective except in hit and run guerrilla attacks which
                                well-trained and equipped Viet army could deal with more effectively
                                than-French.</p>
                            <p>He does not believe Vietnam Govt interested in participating any
                                Pacific Union that may result from Baguio conversations and has
                                warned Bao Dai against association his govt with Nationalist

                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">Begin translation</hi>) The Government of the
                                    Republic has received the official notification of the
                                    constitution by Your Majesty of the Vietnam Government charged
                                    with ensuring the implementation of the agreements of March 8,
                                    with establishing the state, with carrying out urgent reforms,
                                    with preparing and ensuring peace and, the peace won, with
                                    organizing the free consultation of the people on the final
                                    choice of their political regime and their government.</p>
                                <p>We are convinced that Your Majesty will bring these tasks to a
                                    successful conclusion.</p>
                                <p>As far as it is concerned, the Government of the Republic has
                                    just made the greatest efforts to attain this objective and will
                                    assist you therein until the complete and sincere execution of
                                    the agreements concluded between us.</p>
                                <p>In loyal negotiation it has entirely satisfied the national
                                    claims of the Vietnam people, such as have been expressed by
                                    Your Majesty since 1945 and such as were specified at that time
                                    by the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government of Ho Chi
                                    Minh: The unity of the Vietnam was approved by the vote of the
                                    French Parliament and by a French law changing the status of
                                    Cochin China.</p>
                                <p>The independence of the Vietnam State was recognized in the
                                    agreements of March 8, 1949 by the Government of the
                                    Republic.</p>
                                <p>The relations between Vietnam and France within the framework of
                                    the French Union were clearly and extensively defined in the
                                    very terms of the constitution in order to assure common
                                    prosperity and the common defense, more indispensable than ever
                                    in the instability, the uncertainty and the anxieties of the
                                    world.</p>
                                <p>Thus, the armed conflict, allegedly launched for the fulfillment
                                    of these national claims, has no further object. The peace,
                                    ardently desired by the Vietnamese people as well as by France,
                                    is in the hands of the Vietnamese people and their hands
                                    alone.</p>
                                <p>Undoubtedly, Sire, an atmosphere of confidence, of friendship and
                                    of loyal and sincere collaboration must be established between
                                    our associated states in the French Union.</p>
                                <p>The fact that the Government of the Republic and I, myself, in my
                                    capacity as President of the Republic and of the French Union,
                                    vouch for the loyal and entire execution of the agreements
                                    signed, will contribute to its establishment.</p>
                                <p>The High Commissioner has received all instructions to transfer
                                    to Your Majesty’s government the services, for which the
                                    responsibility will henceforth be incumbent on the Vietnam
                                    State, and to place at its <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0086"

                                    such time as you may deem necessary.</p>
                                <p>Our military chiefs will give you their collaboration for the
                                    organization and instruction of the Vietnam army placed under
                                    the responsibility of your government and acting in concert, for
                                    common security, with our army.</p>
                                <p>I confirm to you for my part in the name of the government of the
                                    Republic the terms of my telegram of May 22, 1949 according to
                                    which I declared myself ready to accredit the Ambassadors,
                                    Ministers and Consuls appointed with your approval and on your
                                    recommendations to the states provided for in our agreements: As
                                    also to accept, in agreement with you, the Ambassadors,
                                    Ministers and Consuls appointed to your state by foreign
                                    powers.</p>
                                <p>Under the conditions provided in the act of March 8, 1949 the
                                    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic will support,
                                    before the General Assembly of the U.N., the candidacy of the
                                    Vietnam State to this great international organization, in order
                                    that, through the French Union and world solidarity, the
                                    independence, security and frontiers of the state be
                                    guaranteed.</p>
                                <p>Lastly, it is with great satisfaction that the Government of the
                                    Republic and I have heard the noble appeal, highly appreciated,
                                    of Your Majesty in making a formal promise to submit to the
                                    sovereign will of the Vietnam people—after all necessary
                                    preparations for a pacified and organized territory—the choice
                                    of their constitutional regime, political institutions and
                                    government.</p>
                                <p>If, for the organization of the territory and for this
                                    consultation, the Vietnam people decided to unite for the
                                    cessation of hostilities, which, we repeat, depends only on
                                    themselves, the Government of the Republic and I will be glad to
                                    see thus established the peaceful conditions for the renaissance
                                    of Vietnam and for the renewal of the bonds of friendship which
                                    must unite our two nations for a sound prosperity and
                                    security.</p>
                                <p>If this were not so, if—despite the real and effective
                                    satisfaction of aspirations which they themselves defined at the
                                    outset of this conflict—certain men or certain political
                                    movements, for reasons or changes in orientation concealed by
                                    vain pretexts, should maintain their attitude, it would mean
                                    that they would wish to isolate Vietnam in order to lead her
                                    later towards destinies which at that time would appear clearly
                                    and would open, too late, the eyes of sincere and temporarily
                                    misled Vietnamese.</p>
                                <p>We wish to believe that it will not be so.</p>
                                <p>In any case, ‘Sire, certain of being in agreement with your
                                    government and with the populations torn and ruined by war, the
                                    Government of the Republic will not abandon the peoples of
                                    Vietnam nor the other associated states to this terrible
                                    solitude and to these dreadful adventures in which those
                                    peoples, thus abandoned, risk losing their independence and the
                                    liberties to which all men are entitled. France will not abandon
                                    them and, if need be, would assure with their government and,
                                    should the need arise, with the assistance of the U.N., the
                                    defense of their independence and their security against all
                                    external attacks if they came to be threatened.</p>
                                <p>It is in this spirit that the Government of the Republic and I
                                    associate ourselves with the appeal which Your Majesty has
                                    already <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0087"/>addressed and
                                    will renew to all political, intellectual and spiritual
                                    organizations of the Vietnam, to all the so hardly tried urban
                                    and rural populations, in order to fulfill our common wish:
                                    Peace, reconstruction and prosperity.</p>
                                <p>Having confidence in your efforts and those of your government to
                                    realize the objectives recalled in this letter and to establish
                                    your communal organizations in the depths of the scattered
                                    villages and rice fields, I pray you, Sire, to accept for the

                                internal French consumption. Wintrebert, assistant to Political
                                Counselor Bonfils, who was present during this part conversation,
                                agreed with Du Gardier’s analysis but felt point (<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>Du Gardier subsequently said recent information indicates that local

                                causing increased internal dissension between hardened Stalinists
                                and nationalist elements within Viet Minh with some evidence that Ho
                                Chi Minh then is to favor latter group in opposition to Giap. French
                                feel that proper approach from Bao Dai might accentuate and
                                consolidate this split. French also informed recent anti-Communist
                                stand of Vatican has had influence on those Vietnam Catholics til

                                        preferable to take initiative ourselves in belief that

                                        follow our lead. First step could be intimation that we
                                        would be glad to receive good will mission from Bao Dai at
                                        some convenient time in near future.</item>

                            <p>I opened the conversation by suggesting the desirability of beginning
                                a <hi rend="italic">tour d’horizon</hi> of Southeast Asia and
                                inviting Mr. Dening’s views on French Indochina. Mr. Dening stated
                                that his Government had considered it highly desirable that the
                                interested Asiatic powers indicate their approval of the March 8
                                agreement with Bao Dai and of his Government before the Governments
                                of the United Kingdom or the United States volunteered their
                                approval. He said that his Government had concluded that the
                                reaction of the Asiatic powers to the Bao Dai effort was not as
                                favorable as might have been hoped—their attitude appears dubious
                                but not hostile. He continued to say that his Government believed
                                that the course of events in Asia made it even more desirable that
                                the Asiatic powers give Bao Dai their blessing before the Western
                                powers announced their approval. Mr. Dening interpolated his opinion
                                that French concessions to Bao Dai were not as extensive as those
                                concessions which the Dutch seemed prepared to make to the
                                Indonesians and that as a consequence, French unpopularity in the
                                Far and Middle East had not diminished since March 8 in any
                                appreciable degree. I asked Mr. Dening if his Government had in mind
                                any approach to the Asiatic powers designed to encourage their early
                                approval of Bao Dai. Mr. Dening replied that he did not know but
                                that he would ask Mr. Bevin. I asked Mr. Dening how his Government
                                proposed to respond to the French notification of the establishment
                                of the Government of Vietnam under Bao Dai, adding that we felt that
                                the French were not disposed to be satisfied with anything less than
                                the accrediting of senior diplomatic representation to the Bao Dai
                                Government. Mr. Dening replied that he did not know what course his
                                Government would take.</p>
                            <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0091"/>
                            <p>I observed that my Government had made no decision in the matter of
                                the recognition of the Bao Dai Government nor of the extent and
                                character of support if any which we were prepared to give it, but
                                that the Department was much impressed by the fact that there
                                appeared as a practical matter no alternative to the recognition and
                                support of Bao Dai; that inaction might well result in the control
                                of French Indochina by the Communist Ho Chi Minh; that in view of
                                this simple choice of alternatives, the Department had issued its
                                statement on the March 8 agreement. Mr. Dening said he thought his
                                Government would wish to press the French to make further
                                concessions to Bao Dai and simultaneously to impress upon the
                                Asiatic powers the simple choice of alternatives in the given
                                premises (he did not dissent from my view that the choice of the
                                alternatives was as simple as I had stated it). He added that he
                                felt his Government was prepared to tell the Asiatic powers that
                                they considered the concessions embodied in the March 8 agreement
                                evidence of genuine effort on the part of the French to accommodate
                                Indochinese nationalism.</p>
                            <p>I asked Mr. Dening his Government’s opinion of Bao Dai’s performance
                                since his return to Indochina. He replied that his Government had
                                been agreeably surprised, particularly by the favorable reception
                                which Bao Dai had received in Tonkin. He added that officials of his
                                Government held high opinion of Mr. Pignon whom he considered
                                eminently realistic. In this connection, he referred to a
                                conversation he had with Pignon in which Pignon said he realized he
                                had been selected for his present position because, not being a
                                politician, he could be disowned if his efforts met with failure. I
                                took this occasion to refer to Mr. Pignon’s remarks at New Delhi
                                that he was not particularly concerned with the manner in which Bao
                                Dai disposed of internal affairs in Indochina nor with the manner in
                                which he dealt with Ho Chi Minh, adding that it gave us pause to
                                think since it seemed to foreshadow the unpleasant possibility that
                                Bao Dai might choose to make a deal with Ho. Mr. Dening did not
                                comment on this contingency but countered by referring to a radio
                                Vietnam broadcast in which Ho Chi Minh expressed his gratitude to
                                Stalin for the assistance the latter had provided him in the way of
                                arms in his struggle against the French. He remarked that he
                                considered this revelation of the close relationship which existed
                                between Ho and the Kremlin had inclined the Indians toward a better
                                understanding of the Communist character of Ho and his
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>I asked Mr. Dening if his Government had carefully considered the
                                consequences of Bao Dai’s failure. As Mr. Dening’s reply was of a
                                negative character, I pointed out that a Communist-dominated
                                Indochina would expose Siam and Malaya to immediate Communist
                                pressure; I remarked that whatever its intentions, I did not
                                consider Siam <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0092"/>a tower of
                                strength in such a situation, adding that I thought the Siamese were
                                inclined to continue the habits they had formed in the 19th century
                                of playing off one great power against another, and that they had
                                not fully understood that Russian imperialism in the 20th century
                                was of a different constituency than British and French imperialism
                                in the 19th century. Mr. Dening agreed adding that a recent
                                conversation with the Siamese ambassador at London had led him to
                                conclude that at least that official was inclined to assume that
                                Siam could have the best of both worlds in the event of USSR–Western
                                conflict as it had after the Japanese war.</p>
                            <p>I then asked Mr. Dening if he felt we could afford to face the
                                consequences of failing to give more than reasonable support to Bao
                                Dai. Mr. Dening replied that it would be necessary for him to
                                consult Mr. Bevin before he could reply, but that it was his hope
                                that the Asiatic powers could be brought to realize the unhappy
                                consequences of Bao Dai’s failure.</p>
                            <p>I asked Mr. Dening if his Government had made any estimate of the
                                French military situation in Indochina. Mr. Dening replied that the
                                French had advised his Government that they believed they could hold
                                the frontier. I asked if it was his belief that the French could
                                restrain the Chinese Communists from pouring across the Tonkinese
                                border. Mr. Dening replied that he thought Ho would be particularly
                                careful in encouraging large movements of Chinese troops into his
                                territory since the Chinese were unpopular in Indochina. He added,
                                however, that the French would certainly find the frontier difficult
                                to hold. Mr. Reed observed that his knowledge of the terrain had led
                                him to conclude that the French would find the border very difficult
                                to hold indeed, and that the Chinese would, as a matter of good
                                sense, choose to infiltrate in small groups rather than <hi

                            <p>I asked Mr. Dening if he thought recognition of Bao Dai by the
                                interested Asiatic powers would strengthen him in the eyes of his
                                Indochinese constituents. Mr. Dening said he was doubtful since he
                                believed the Indochinese were relatively impervious to the attitude
                                of foreign states. Mr. Reed said that he believed the Indochinese
                                would be impressed by one thing only; further French concessions to
                                Bao Dai of a real character, including the transfer of Indochinese
                                affairs from the Minister of the Overseas France to the Foreign
                                Office; that such concessions, if coupled with the recognition of
                                the Asiatic states, would in his opinion have a profound effect upon
                                the Indochinese people who ardently desire peace after years of war.
                                I suggested that these various considerations seemed to me to
                                indicate the desirability of Mr. Bevin’s and Mr. Acheson’s
                                impressing upon Mr. Schuman the importance of the French
                                Government’s continuing on the course of making real and genuine
                                concessions to Indochinese nationalism. Mr. Dening said <pb n="79"
                                    xml:id="pg_79" facs="0093"/>that he would present this view to
                                Mr. Bevin but that Mr. Bevin was especially aware of French
                                sensitivity in this particular. Mr. Lacy asked what Mr. Dening
                                considered the effect might be of US–UK recognition of Bao
                                Dai—whether indeed it would strengthen Bao Dai, or would, as some
                                believed, prove a “kiss of death”. Mr. Dening replied that he
                                thought US–UK recognition of Bao Dai, unless preceded by a favorable
                                expression from the interested Asiatic powers, would have an
                                unfavorable effect on Bao Dai and would cause certain members of the
                                British Commonwealth considerable annoyance.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening and Mr. Meade continued a brief discussion which resulted
                                in Mr. Dening’s expressing the opinion that Mr. Bevin must (1)
                                impress upon the Asiatic powers and members of the British
                                Commonwealth the fact that no acceptable alternative existed to the
                                support of Bao Dai, and (2) encourage the French to make further
                                genuine concessions to Bao Dai. He added that the nature of these”
                                concessions and the manner in which the approach to the French
                                should be made, should be left to Mr. Bevin and Mr. Acheson.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Meade asked if I could describe the Philippine attitude toward
                                Bao Dai. I replied that I considered the Philippine situation had
                                not yet crystalized; that we had consulted with the Philippine
                                representatives in Washington before we issued our press statement
                                on Bao Dai but that we had not attempted to influence them. I added
                                that we were prepared to influence their position when we considered
                                the time appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening asked that the conversations be brought to a close at 5:25
                                p. m. I suggested and he agreed that conversations would be resumed
                                at 10:30 Monday morning, at which time Indonesia would be the topic
                                of consideration.<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1">For further report, see

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that
                                during the course of a recent conversation with Mr. R. H. Scott,
                                Head of the South-East Asia Department of the Foreign Office, he
                                discussed with me the problem presented by the negotiations
                                initiated by the Bao Dai government for representation in Australia,
                                the Philippines, Thailand and India. It seems that Australia has
                                approached the United Kingdom on this question and has asked for its
                                views as to the appropriateness of accepting a Bao Dai
                                representative.</p>
                            <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0094"/>
                            <p>Mr. Scott said that his Government was most anxious to do everything
                                possible within the limits of law and common sense to support Bao
                                Dai, and was attempting within these limits to find some basis to
                                encourage other members of the Commonwealth to do likewise. The
                                legal people in the Foreign Office, he said, raised three serious
                                objections to the recognition of Bao Dai: (1) The agreement between
                                Bao Dai and the French Government, even though fully implemented,
                                would grant Bao Dai only the most limited sovereignty; (2) The
                                agreement requires ratification by both parties to become effective
                                and this ratification has not yet taken place; and (3) by no stretch
                                of the imagination could the regime as now constituted be construed
                                as being in <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> control. If the
                                agreement were ratified, and if happily Bao Dai did obtain control
                                of a substantial portion of the country, the Foreign Office lawyers
                                might then, notwithstanding the limiting features of the agreement,
                                be able to find some formula for <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> or
                                even <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition of Bao Dai, or at
                                least encourage Australia and India to do so.</p>
                            <p>With respect to India, Mr. Scott recalled, Nehru temporized by
                                stating that his departure abroad would interfere with the reception
                                of a Bao Dai representative. Bangkok likewise was finding the
                                question embarrassing because of the large number of Free-Laotian
                                and other political refugees from Indochina resident in Northern
                                Thailand. Never bold with respect to foreign affairs, it could not
                                be expected that Thailand take a leading position in support of Bao
                                Dai.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Scott inquired whether the Philippine Government had approached
                                the American authorities in regard to this matter. He said it would
                                be very helpful if he could be acquainted of the Department’s views.
                                Because of the Australian inquiry, he said, the question was of some
                                urgency.</p>
                            <p>I should be grateful for any information on the above subject which I
                                could appropriately pass on to the Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>With regard information received by my British colleague that Schuman
                                in Washington talks spoke of early ratification March 8 agreements,
                                Pignon said he was puzzled by this since agreement provides for
                                ratification only after negotiation supplementary accords which
                                become part of instrument to be ratified. Thus ratification would
                                not seem possible before February. He also spoke of the possibility
                                of absorbing all agreements into one inclusive document which he
                                personally favors for sake of clarity and because March 8 agreement
                                is “very badly drafted document.”</p>

                                that the Department had recently circulated its missions in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> on the question of probable
                                reaction in that area to recognition of a Chinese Communist
                                government by the Western powers, and that the replies so far
                                received indicated without exception that early recognition by the
                                Western <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0098"/>powers would cause
                                adverse reactions in Southeast Asia. Mr. Dening commented that,
                                whether early or late, recognition would have adverse consequences.
                                Mr. Butterworth said that in the Department’s view early recognition
                                would carry special disadvantages for Southeast Asia.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the discussions on Hong Kong, Mr. Dening stated
                                that the Ministers of the Cabinet had authorized Mr. Bevin to tell
                                the Secretary that the UK considered Hong Kong the right wing
                                bastion of the Southeast Asian front; that if Hong Kong were lost,
                                the whole front might go; that the UK regards Hong Kong in the same
                                way that it regards Berlin; and that the UK will disregard the
                                extent of military commitment necessary to hold Hong Kong but that
                                it <hi rend="italic">must not go</hi>.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the Japanese peace treaty, Mr. Meade (First
                                Secretary of the British Embassy) recognizing the possibility of the
                                emergence of Indonesia and/or Indochina as sovereign states,
                                considered that all countries which had actually waged, not just
                                declared, war on Japan should be asked to the conference. Mr.
                                Butterworth pointed out that this formula would admit Mexico and
                                possibly other countries having remote interests in the Far East, a
                                situation which would be resented by the Asiatics.</p>
                            <p>In connection with a regional arrangement in Southeast Asia, Mr.
                                Dening stated that the British government considered that the first
                                and necessary step toward meeting the Communist threat to Southeast
                                Asia was to develop the economies of the countries of the area to a
                                degree of strength equal if not superior to Communist pressure. Mr.
                                Butterworth pointed out that the essential political instabilities
                                in Indonesia and Indochina were an almost insurmountable obstacle to
                                the successful extension of financial and economic assistance. In
                                answer to a question, Mr. Dening stated his belief that the
                                influence of anti-Communist states would have an appreciable
                                influence on India adding that India was learning more about
                                Communism in Asia as time went on; that, for example, Ho Chi Minh’s
                                radio association with Stalin had had a salutary effect upon the
                                Indian estimates of the Communist character of Ho Chi Minh’s
                                government.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Secretary–Mr. Bevin conversation</hi>
                                <note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">On September 13.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>The Secretary pointed out to Mr. Bevin that we feel nationalism is an
                                offset to Communism and a rallying point for dissatisfied elements
                                who otherwise might become Communists. In promoting nationalism, we,
                                of course, must be careful not to encourage the native peoples to
                                feel resentment towards colonial powers. We feel that the French and
                                Dutch should follow the excellent British lead. We plan to talk to
                                Mr. <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0099"/>Schuman and urge that the
                                French move faster in Indochina in setting up a Vietnam national
                                state. We would like to see some of the Asiatic nations take the
                                lead in recognizing a nationalist government there. We feel it would
                                be the “kiss of death” if we or the British took the lead.</p>
                            <p>In reply, Mr. Bevin said he wished the French had gone further in
                                Vietnam. He said it was possible the French wanted the United States
                                and Great Britain to recognize the Bao Dai government in Indochina
                                so that they could present a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> to
                                the Assembly and the Assembly would have to ratify the new
                                agreements. But he didn’t like this possibility. He said that before
                                we did anything, the French government should ratify the agreements
                                and shift its dealings with the Bao Dai government from the Colonial
                                office to the Foreign office. We can’t recognize the Bao Dai
                                government until the French take these steps but we don’t want the
                                favorable possibility to go by default either. Mr. Dening said the
                                people of Indochina wanted peace more than anything else. The
                                Secretary said that we can feel Mr. Schuman out but we must get the
                                French to take the requisite steps. Can we get countries in the
                                area, say Burma and India, to take the lead in recognition after the
                                French do the necessary? Mr. Bevin said they hadn’t sounded them out
                                and that the Burmese and Siamese were cautious. He thought that if
                                the French ratify, we could get the Asiatics to recognize the <hi
                                    rend="italic">de facto</hi> government. Ho Chi Minh had thanked
                                Stalin in a radio broadcast for assistance and had exposed his hand
                                as being a Moscow Communist and this had been passed on to Nehru who
                                previously had thought Ho was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>
                                Nationalist leader. Mr. Bevin repeated that the French must give us
                                the groundwork.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth emphasized that while we are not fully satisfied with
                                the Bao Dai regime, we saw no acceptable alternative in this area,
                                and that accordingly we and the British should push behind this
                                experiment. He called attention to a recent report from our Consul
                                General in Saigon to the effect that the fillip which had been given
                                by our original statement and that of the British government on Bao
                                Dai was now wearing off and there was need for a new effort. Before
                                turning to other subjects, an understanding was reached between Mr.
                                Bevin and the Secretary that we would meet with Mr. Schuman and urge
                                him strongly to take the two steps referred to; namely, ratification
                                and the transfer of business to the Foreign Office. Subsequently,
                                Mr. Bevin would take the matter up with the Asiatic Commonwealth
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>In a meeting (September 14) with Mr. Dening, the day following the
                                Secretary’s conversation with Mr. Bevin, called for the purpose of
                                tying up any loose ends that might have appeared, Mr. Butterworth
                                suggested that it would be helpful if Mr. Bevin would impress <pb
                                    n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0100"/>upon Mr. Schuman the
                                importance of France’s imposing as few restrictions as possible on
                                the ability of the Vietnam government to conduct its foreign
                                relations, arguing that this would be an important factor in
                                obtaining the recognition of the Vietnam government by South Asian
                                countries. Mr. Dening observed that Mr. Schuman would undoubtedly
                                reply that the March 8 Agreement goes as far as it can in this
                                direction without causing trouble with French North Africa; but that
                                he was inclined to agree with Mr. Butterworth that the issue is of
                                sufficient importance to bring to Mr. Schuman’s attention again in
                                the context of the difficulties which would arise were the Bao Dai
                                government not recognized by India, Burma and other nearby
                                countries. In this connection, Mr. Dening stated that the UK had
                                been at pains to convince Nehru that Bao Dai, rather than Ho Chi
                                Minh, is the power in Indochina with whom India should deal.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Secretary–Mr. Schuman Conversation</hi> (September
                                15)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schuman outlined France’s views on the Indochinese situation as
                                follows:</p>
                            <p>France is faced with a very serious situation in Indochina because of
                                the heavy financial strain it places on French budgetary
                                equilibrium. French expenditures in Indochina would amount this year
                                to almost 200 billion francs, approximately one-eighth of the total
                                French budget.</p>
                            <p>He said that the French efforts to prevent Indochina from falling
                                into Communist hands transcended and went far beyond French national
                                interests since French action represented the hard core of
                                resistance to Communist attempts to take over Indochina with a view
                                ultimately to take over all of Southeast Asia. France was therefore
                                fighting the battle of all the democratic powers and would need
                                assistance to hold Indochina. He realized that it was politically
                                impossible for the United States to give military aid to Indochina
                                but there were forms of economic assistance which the United States
                                could give. This assistance need not be given directly to France but
                                be given to the three governments (the Vietnam state of Bao Dai
                                which unites the three <hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_ky1">ky</gloss>s;</hi> Laos; and Cambodia)
                                which France had established in Indochina. In this connection France
                                had turned over a large measure of independence to these governments
                                and was sponsoring a truly nationalist movement in Indochina so that
                                these governments could win the support of the overwhelming majority
                                of the inhabitants who were certainly not pro-Communist. He said
                                that the Bao Dai agreements of March 8 did not represent a limit to
                                the concessions which the French would eventually make and that
                                France intended to follow an enlightened course looking to greater
                                self-government. Mr. Schuman hoped that the United States also would
                                support these independent governments.</p>
                            <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0101"/>
                            <p>In conclusion Schuman said he wished to point out that a number of
                                people were perhaps laboring under the mistaken belief that if
                                France got out of Indochina the native inhabitants would have a
                                better chance of attaining real independence. This was an erroneous
                                viewpoint since at the present time the three infant governments
                                were incapable of succeeding alone and would need French military
                                assistance to survive the Communist efforts to take over the country
                                and would also need French technical assistance to arrive at a point
                                where they could cope with their own internal problems of
                                organization. In other words the presence of the French Army and
                                French technical advisers was indispensable to the emergence of
                                truly nationalist and independent states in Indochina. He reiterated
                                that France intended to be most liberal in dealing with these
                                governments so that gradually they could attain an increasing degree
                                of independence. He said that in a sense France had been penalized
                                for trying to hold the line against Communist efforts in Indochina
                                since as a result thereof Indochina had been excluded from the
                                benefits of the Marshall Plan.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary replied that he was very glad to have had Mr. Schuman
                                outline the French position to him and he was particularly glad to
                                note that in many respects the French thinking was so close to our
                                own. The Secretary said that he could not give Mr. Schuman any reply
                                as to the question of what aid might be given to Indochina as he
                                would have to study the matter very carefully. He said, however,
                                that we realized that the presence of French troops and technical
                                advisers in Indochina was indispensable at this stage of the game
                                and for a considerable time to come and that we had never suggested
                                that the French withdraw and abandon Indochina. The Secretary said
                                that we fully recognized the importance of Indochina in connection
                                with the whole Southeast Asia picture but that he did believe the
                                French could play a great role in preventing Communist domination by
                                moving quickly wherever possible to satisfy the truly nationalist
                                aspirations of the inhabitants.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the question of what might be done for the
                                governments in Indochina, the Secretary said he hoped the French
                                Parliament would ratify the March 8 Agreements rapidly but he wished
                                to mention that at present the French position seemed somewhat
                                anomalous in that Indochinese affairs are now being administered by
                                the French Ministry of Overseas Areas which did not seem consistent
                                with the French statement that the governments are to a large degree
                                independent. The Secretary said that he also thought it was most
                                important that the other governments of Southeast Asia, particularly
                                India, Burma and Siam, recognize the independent status of the Bao
                                Dai government and in this connection the French could be helpful by
                                giving greater independence to the Indochinese governments in <pb
                                    n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0102"/>their foreign relations. The
                                Secretary said that at the present time and given conditions in
                                Indochina he realized it might be difficult to give the Indochinese
                                governments as much internal authority as was desirable but that in
                                the field of foreign affairs there certainly appeared something that
                                could be done. He said that if the United States and Great Britain
                                rushed in to recognize the Bao Dai Government it might, in a sense,
                                be the “kiss of death” to Bao Dai since certain Asian political
                                leaders such as Nehru, might think that the United States and Great
                                Britain were acting with imperialistic motives to insure continuing
                                full French control and domination of Indochina. On the other hand
                                the Secretary thought that the British might be helpful in getting
                                the governments of India and Burma to recognize the Bao Dai
                                Government and we would be disposed to do what we could to encourage
                                the Governments of Southeast Asia to recognize the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-Chinese nationalist government
                                which had recently been established as a result of the March 8
                                Agreements.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schuman said that he agreed with the Secretary and that he had
                                already taken up with the French Cabinet the question of
                                transferring responsibility for Indochina from the French Ministry
                                of Overseas France to the French Foreign Office. While he hoped to
                                be able to arrange for this it was difficult at the moment because
                                of French internal considerations but that once the March 8
                                Agreements were ratified he thought it would be much easier and he
                                hoped that this ratification would occur soon after the Parliament
                                reconvened in October. Mr. Schuman said that he also agreed with the
                                advisability of the other Southeast Asian governments recognizing
                                Bao Dai.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Secretary–Mr. Bevin–Mr. Schuman Conversation</hi>
                                (September 17)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Schuman then talked about Indochina. He said the Bao Dai
                                government was not quite complete but it was satisfactory. The
                                government was not yet fully established but it would be and it was
                                the only way for a permanent solution. There is no love lost between
                                the Chinese and the Indochinese. The Indochinese are afraid of
                                China. Some of Ho’s men, if there was a threat of invasion from
                                China, might go over to Bai Dai. If the Southeast Asian countries
                                recognize the Bao Dai government, its prestige would be increased.
                                Perhaps the United Kingdom and the United States could help the
                                French with Southeast Asia. The agreement with the Bao Dai
                                government would be ratified by the French Parliament soon. Siam
                                perhaps could be encouraged to recognize, by a word from the United
                                States or the United Kingdom, the Bao Dai government. Bevin asked
                                when the French Parliament would ratify the agreement. Schuman
                                replied that Parliament meets on October 18 and should ratify it a
                                few weeks after that—perhaps in November. Bevin remarked that France
                                has to ratify the agreement before anyone else can help.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary said that if the French ratify the March 8 Agreement
                                and transfer dealings with Bao Dai to the Foreign Office, we could
                                help with the Philippines and Siam. The Southeast Asian countries
                                should take the first steps, otherwise recognition by the United
                                Kingdom and the United States in advance of other countries would
                                make the Bao Dai government look like a Western “front”. Congress

                                removing Indochina from Overseas France Ministry (which amounts to

                            <p>335. Text given press two letters from Bao Dai to President Auriol
                                and Boisdon, President, Assembly French Union.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d73fn1">Text in French were published October 17 at
                                    Saigon and transmitted to the Department in dispatch 205,
                                    October 25, from Saigon, not printed.</note> First is reply to
                                Auriol’s letter July 27 (mytel 257, August 11). While text given
                                press undated, Bonfils believes in recent answer original taken
                                Paris by Pignon. Delay of two months in replying Auriol perhaps
                                significant.</p>
                            <p>In letter Bao Dai ties together Auriol’s statement that return of
                                peace depends entirely on Vietnam with President’s promise that
                                March 8 agreements would be loyally implemented and says “return
                                peace depends on manner agreements we signed are applied. On March 8
                                we reached meeting of minds. This must now be translated into
                                action”.</p>
                            <p>Emperor then refers to Auriol’s promise that if all efforts fail
                                France will defend independence and security Vietnam with help
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> if necessary and concludes
                                “in the eventuality foreseen by you my government gives its full
                                approval to an appeal to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>.[”]</p>
                            <p>Bao Dai thus joins swelling chorus of those who blame everything on
                                delaying implementing March 8 agreements and contend nothing can be
                                accomplished till implementation completed. While there is some
                                truth in this argument, it opens dangerous possibility of new
                                psychological letdown when it is discovered that implementation
                                accords has by no means solved all problems and has in fact created
                                many new ones.</p>

                                have been accepted by Prime Minister Nehru as the basis for his
                                remarks to you on Indochina. The memorandum falls naturally into two

                                    <item>The memorandum omits to state that Ho Chi Minh’s

                                        of the Indochinese federation within the French Union which
                                        puts entirely different light upon concessions the French
                                        made at that time.</item>

                            </p>
                            <p>However, it is in the conclusions drawn from these facts with which I
                                disagree. I do not believe that by having the French treat with Ho
                                Chi Minh, who is presumably the real leader of the Vietnamese people
                                to whom Mr. Nehru’s memorandum has reference, we will be able to
                                save Indochina for democracy. While such a plan might have been
                                feasible at the time the Communists participated in the governments
                                of Italy and France, from which they were later expelled, this is no
                                longer so. However, the insistent French pressure since the end of
                                the war, characterized by failure to accommodate the legitimate
                                nationalist <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0107"/>aspirations of
                                the Vietnamese, has enabled Ho Chi Minh and the Communist leadership
                                to consolidate its hold upon the very deep-seated nationalist
                                movement. The Communist grip of the armed forces fighting the French
                                appears particularly strong. It, therefore, seems beyond the realm
                                of possibility that the nationalist movement could throw off its
                                Communist control without external assistance. As you know, we have
                                long felt that the strongest weapon the French could place in Bao
                                Dai’s hands was a promise of ultimate independence or independence
                                at a fixed date some time in the future. We have felt that by thus
                                accommodating the nationalist movement the French would lure support
                                from Ho Chi Minh and with their help Bao Dai might be able to
                                establish a nationalist government. For reasons of French internal
                                politics no French government has made a promise of ultimate
                                independence for Indochina and it is further evident that no amount
                                of pressure on our part would have brought forth such a
                                statement.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that the memorandum, while in a single sentence
                                acknowledging Ho Chi Minh to be a Communist, generally takes the
                                attitude that he is primarily a Nationalist. Accepting that Ho is a
                                Communist, it can only be concluded that he is working toward
                                extending Soviet domination in Asia. The refusal of the memorandum
                                to recognize this imperialism because it is being carried out by
                                    <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-Chinese instead of
                                foreigners is its basic fault. No amount of legerdemain can conceal
                                the fact that the Indians will not, at least at the present,
                                recognize this new imperialism. Their emotional reaction to the
                                imperialism of the 19th century is so great that it has blinded them
                                to the fact that Russian imperialism in the 20th century is of a
                                different consistency than 19th century imperialism.</p>
                            <p>I do not believe that we can make these views available either
                                directly or indirectly to the French for the Department cannot be
                                put in the position of urging at the present time a French
                                government to negotiate with the Communists. Neither do I think that
                                we can afford to allow the United Nations in any guise to intervene
                                as a mediator in this struggle for such mediation would inevitably
                                be a vehicle for forcing the French to yield the country to
                                Communist domination.</p>
                            <p>We should continue the line of approach that we have followed with
                                Nehru, expanding that approach to include the thesis that Communist
                                activity, particularly Chinese and Vietnamese expansion into
                                Southeast Asia, is an expression of Soviet imperialism. You will
                                recall that Ambassador Henderson, during the past six months, has
                                evidently succeeded in persuading the government of India that Ho
                                Chi Minh is a Communist, a proposition which Mr. Nehru accepted in
                                his recent conversation with you. We should now stress particularly
                                the nature and overall menace of Soviet imperialism, an operation
                                which will be <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0108"/>delicate but no
                                more so than was the effort to convince Mr. Nehru of Ho Chi Minh’s
                                real political affiliations and ideology.</p>

                            <p>The Foreign Office has informed us that Mr. Schuman will wish to
                                discuss with Messrs. Acheson and Bevin the question of the
                                recognition of the Chinese Communist Government, and in this
                                connection he will undoubtedly raise the question of <gloss

                                we are told that what he specifically has in mind is the possibility
                                of Nationalist troops retreating into <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                    >Indo</gloss>-China and the situation resulting therefrom, and
                                also the possibility of the US and UK extending some form of moral
                                support to the Bao Dai Government. We are told that he probably will
                                not raise the question of economic or military support to Vietnam or
                                recognition of the Bao Dai Government.</p>

                                    >Indo</gloss>-China. The High Commissioner, M. Pignon, is
                                leaving for Saigon tonight after a stay in Paris which was prolonged
                                by the Government crisis. The Embassy took advantage of his enforced
                                idleness to conduct a series of informal conversations with him. It
                                was thought that the subjects covered in these talks might receive
                                Government <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0110"/>consideration
                                before the Secretary’s arrival and that a tentative French

                                conversations between the three Ministers. This has not transpired,
                                and our latest word indicates that Schuman will not be in a position
                                to initiate substantive talks on <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                    >Indo</gloss>-China. However, the substance of our verbal
                                exchanges with Pignon is given below.</p>
                            <p>The informal and purely exploratory discussions with High
                                Commissioner Pignon covered current <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                    >Indo</gloss>-China situation and steps which might be taken by
                                both the French and American Governments to improve the situation in
                                    <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy outlined the measures to be taken by the French which it
                                considered would not only ensure the best chance of rapid success of
                                the Bao Dai experiment but also encourage further international
                                support thereof by foreign powers, including the US. These were:
                                Parliamentary ratification of the March 8 agreements, the early
                                conclusions of the negotiations of the supplementary agreements and
                                the effective transfer of administrative functions to the Vietnamese
                                Government, the transfer to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the
                                administration of the Vietnamese Affairs, and lastly, a public
                                declaration by the French Government in the near future to the
                                effect that the March 8 agreements represent only one step in an
                                evolutionary process, that they are not intended permanently to
                                define the status of Vietnam within the French Union, and that the
                                final treaty defining that status will be concluded with a duly
                                elected Vietnamese government.</p>
                            <p>M. Pignon informed us that he believed French government to be
                                favorably disposed towards the early ratification of March 8
                                agreements, and that he was confident that upon his return to <gloss
                                    target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China, the negotiation of the
                                supplementary accords could be accelerated and completed prior to
                                the end of the year. He personally was favorably disposed towards
                                the transfer of Vietnamese affairs to the Ministry of Foreign
                                Affairs but considered that the domestic political situation might
                                make such a complete break impossible at the moment, and that as an
                                interim measure, a special agency comparable to Britain’s
                                Commonwealth Editions Office and responsible to the President of the
                                Council might be created for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>As regards a governmental declaration on the evolutionary character
                                of the March 8 agreements, he, himself, was personally well disposed
                                towards this idea which he believed would be of great psychological
                                value in the Viet Nam as well as in neighboring countries of
                                southeast Asia. He considered, however, that such a declaration
                                should only be made at such time as the negotiation of the
                                supplementary <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0111"/>agreements
                                should have been concluded: coming earlier, it would jeopardize the
                                successful conclusion of these negotiations and Bao Dai solution
                                itself.</p>
                            <p>With regard to assistance which the US might extend, he mentioned
                                action on our part to dissipate beliefs widely held in Viet Nam that
                                the US favored the total withdrawal of French influence from that
                                area and, once this was accomplished, would be prepared to extend
                                practically unlimited financial and material assistance. He also
                                hoped that the US and Britain could take a common position with
                                France announcing that in the event a Chinese Communist invasion of
                                Tonking, the three countries would take common action. He believed
                                that the presence of American warships, notably aircraft carriers,
                                in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-Chinese waters, would have
                                a decided effect in making our position clear in this respect. He
                                also hoped for assistance from the US in replacing and repairing
                                military transport and combat equipment, and favored supplying
                                military assistance directly to the Viet Nam government provided
                                that this be done in consultation with the French.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, he spoke of direct <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid to
                                Viet Nam which would have more of a psychological than a material
                                benefit, and of a continuation of our past efforts to persuade the
                                government of India to adopt a favorable attitude towards the Bao
                                Dai government.</p>

                            <p>401. From Gibson: <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 199,
                                November 17.<note n="1" xml:id="d79fn1">Not printed.</note> I do not
                                believe there has been any change in French military policy re
                                defense Sino-Vietnam frontier. Policy is still to defend frontier by
                                every means at their command.</p>
                            <p>In reporting my interpretation of Alessandri’s<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d79fn2">Gen. Marcel Alessandri was acting Governor and
                                    French Commanding General in north Vietnam (Tonkin).</note>
                                personal reaction to present situation, I meant to indicate that
                                General is realistically considering all possibilities, the worst of
                                which is that Chinese, either in form of present Communist forces in
                                southern provinces, or of armies further reinforced by additional
                                Nationalist defections, may pursue their way in an organized mass
                                into Indochina. In such an eventuality, though French will
                                unquestionably resist from beginning, it is unrealistic to expect
                                that they will be able to block any such invasion at frontier
                                itself. This conclusion was not only strongly implied by General
                                himself in our reference conversation, but is certainly studied
                                opinion of majority of French military in positions of authority in
                                Tonkin.</p>
                            <p>In stating problem would then consist simply of getting out “with as
                                few losses as possible”, I am reporting what I consider to be on the
                                basis of cordial and, I believe, frank relations, the General’s own
                                personal views. He would not of course state them in so many words
                                to a foreign official yet his implication was clear and undercurrent
                                of other military opinion in Tonkin equally so.</p>
                            <p>Actually, while conservatively realistic to the point of bearing the
                                worst of possibilities constantly in mind and planning accordingly,
                                General is not pessimistic and considers chances this development as
                                being remote.</p>
                            <p>Question of “rear guard action” evolves about point that best French
                                defense can only be achieved in relatively open country where
                                superiority equipment, if any, can be brought to bear. This is
                                particularly true of fighter aircraft including recently arrived
                                King Cobras on which they count so heavily and are ineffective in
                                the rough mountainous jungle country of most of frontier.</p>
                            <p>Thus if circumstances require a “rear guard” action in relatively
                                flat country of delta region would in sense be strategic military
                                manoeuvre for French have learned from bitter experience in Tonkin
                                most recently from inability to protect the Caobang-Langson road
                                convoys that attempts to fight Oriental guerrilla in jungle terrain
                                of <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0113"/>frontier are virtually
                                suicidal. Bombing or strafing in these areas is futile, while
                                movement of mechanized equipment is impossible.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly in worst, French might be faced with withholding their
                                major defenses until they reach area bordering Red River delta, an
                                area of combat uncomfortably near the European centers, Hanoi and
                                Haiphong. If further retreat were found necessary, it would
                                inevitably pose problems of evacuation of the European colonies of
                                two cities. This is only feasible by sea from Haiphong and given the
                                state of road transportation facilities between the two cities,
                                inadequate port facilities, lack of shipping would present a
                                considerable problem.</p>
                            <p>Elimination of Vietminh as an organized fighting force in most of
                                Tonkin by end February in event Chinese Communists establish
                                themselves along frontier with well-disciplined troops and do not
                                violate it on any organized scale is most favorable of all
                                eventualities in Alessandri’s view. In this regard General is
                                undoubtedly thinking primarily of delta and Namdinh–Phatdiem areas
                                in French realization that frontier regions will thenceforth be
                                subject to free exchange of arms and equipment. As long as French
                                and Vietnamese Government forces control heavily populated fertile
                                areas and cut Vietminh lines of communication into them, usefulness
                                of any Chinese Red arms will be considerably restricted. Recent
                                successes in extension of area of control in Red River delta and
                                Phatdiem operation have lent support to General’s hope that this can
                                be accomplished if required. He is also counting heavily on known
                                antipathy of Vietnamese for Chinese and resulting increased degree
                                of cooperation which may be expected from the great mass of the
                                Tonkinese people if they become convinced they are in actual danger
                                of Chinese domination.</p>
                            <p>In weighing the General’s opinions Department is reminded that
                                Alessandri is unquestionably best, if not only, high ranking officer
                                in Indochina qualified to pass judgment on these and related
                                questions with any degree of authority. He is keen student of
                                Oriental mind and thoroughly familiar with terrain in question from
                                actual experience.</p>

                                treaty and previous treaties specifically abrogated insofar as
                                conflict with present one. France guarantees “actual frontiers”
                                Cambodia which would appear deny French support for Cambodian
                                demands revision Vietnam frontier. No limitations on number
                                Cambodian diplomatic missions abroad. Treaty specifically designated
                                as “act” specifying status Cambodian-French union called for by
                                article 61 French Constitution. Effective on signature but mutual

                            <p>Aside from above points, treaty substantially same as March 8 accords
                                but briefer and clearer. Pignon remarked to me that drafting much
                                improved. “We learn by experience”. Same auxiliary accords for

                                Indochina. This airgram was drafted on the basis of a-conversation
                                with Mr. E. H. Scott, Head of the South-East Asia Department of the
                                Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>In a subsequent conversation, Mr. Scott referred to the hope
                                expressed by the members of the Conference at Singapore that
                                Secretary of State Acheson might make a public statement to the
                                effect that in the event of a Communist attack on Indochina the
                                United States would fulfil its duties under the Charter of the
                                United Nations. (Apparently Mr. Bevin would concurrently make a
                                similar public statement). Mr. Scott expressed the informal view
                                that this aspect of the Singapore Conference recommendations at any
                                rate would probably not be acted upon for, as he pointed out, such a
                                stand with regard to Indochina would doubtless elicit from other
                                Governments in an even weaker military position than the French in
                                Indochina (Portugal with respect to Macao, or Thailand, for example)
                                a request for a similar stand with regard to an attack across their
                                frontier. The China–Burma frontier, he recalled, had never even been
                                formally delimited in its entirety. It was his opinion that a
                                guarantee of the frontiers of all the southern neighbors of China
                                might prove to be an overwhelmingly impossible undertaking.</p>

                                Agreement remain substantially same as expressed in <hi

                                    >Dept</gloss> recognizes that Bao Dai has made relatively more
                                progress than had been anticipated, and is encouraged by evident
                                efforts of Fr Statesmen and particularly Pignon to give life and
                                viability to present Vietnam Govt, <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss> queries whether, in view of developments in Far
                                East and notably in China and Indonesia, mere ratification of Mar 8
                                Agreement and transfer of limited powers stipulated thereunder to
                                Bao Dai regime will be sufficient to insure success of or even
                                afford fair chance of success to Bao Dai solution. Unhappily events
                                beyond our control are marching on the mainland of Asia and it may
                                well be that the Mar 8 Agreement is but another instance of too
                                little and too late. This view is predicated upon belief that a mil
                                solution or a polit containment of Communism is indeed beyond the
                                capacity of France and of Western Democracies unless, at very
                                minimum, the Bao Dai regime obtains the support of a substantial
                                proportion of the Vietnamese. Such being the case, <gloss

                                <p>III. The agreement of March 8, 1949, refers to qualified
                                    Vietnamese authorities without specifying what authorities will
                                    be called upon to act. The decision as to who these authorities
                                    shall be constitutes in effect a domestic Vietnamese problem
                                    whose solution will derive from the constitution of that country
                                    which at the present has only provisional institutions.</p>
                                <p>Under the circumstances, it appears that the French Government
                                    cannot inform the US Government of the rules which will result
                                    from the free determination of Vietnam. However, the general
                                    tendencies of political and constitutional order allow one to
                                    suppose that a representative assembly of Vietnam will be called
                                    to pronounce itself on these agreements.</p>
                                <p>IV. The territory of Cochin-China has been part of the associated
                                    Vietnam State since the law of June 4, 1949, and by virtue of
                                    its text.</p>
                                <p>The law of June 4, 1949, was passed pursuant to Article 75 of the
                                    constitution of the French Republic which provides for changes
                                    of status within the French Union as the result of a law passed
                                    after consulting the territorial assemblies and the Assembly of
                                    the French Union. The territorial assembly of Cochin-China was
                                    organized by the law of March 14, 1949.</p>
                                <p>V. The character of the consultation which took place can only be
                                    appreciated in the light of the disturbed situation which then
                                    prevailed in Cochin-China.</p>
                                <p>The French Government did not wish to use the state of disorder
                                    in Cochin-China as a pretext for delaying the reuniting of this
                                    territory to Vietnam. On the one hand, in fact, the demand for
                                    Vietnamian unity constituted such a grounds for agitation that
                                    one risked never achieving pacification if the unity question
                                    was made a condition previous. On the other hand, the sentiment
                                    for Vietnamese unity seemed strong and unanimous enough for the
                                    French Parliament to draw the proper <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105"
                                        facs="0119"/>conclusion, regardless of the imperfections of
                                    the representation charged with its expression in the
                                    territorial assembly.</p>
                                <p>VI. In the interest of reestablishing normal conditions in
                                    Vietnam, the French Government is dealing with H. M. Bao Dai, as
                                    the most qualified Vietnam representative in the present
                                    situation, to reestablish peace in that country under the
                                    authority of a government of its own and whose interests are
                                    truly national.</p>
                                <p>The political regime of Vietnam organized under the authority of
                                    H. M. Bao Dai is still only provisional and holds itself out as
                                    such. The working out of definite institutions for Vietnam will
                                    keep pace with the progress in the task of pacification and
                                    unification to which this provisional government has set for
                                    itself. It will be the concern of the future constitution of
                                    Vietnam, after the population has been able freely to express
                                    itself, to decide on a monarchical or republican form of
                                    government. At that moment Bao Dai will be invested with such
                                    titles (<hi rend="italic">qualités</hi>) as the Vietnamese
                                    nation may confer upon him after it emerges from its
                                    difficulties.</p>
                                <p>VII. Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that
                                    all peaceful states which accept the obligations of the Charter
                                    and, in the judgment of the organization are capable and
                                    disposed to fulfill them, may become members of the United
                                    Nations.</p>
                                <p>Without doubt the disturbances in Indochina and the delays
                                    necessary to draft treaties have not, so far, permitted the
                                    French Government to consider that the Associated States of
                                    Indochina can fulfill all the conditions set forth in the
                                    above-mentioned Article 4.</p>
                                <p>Nevertheless, the solutions already reached in Laos and Cambodia,
                                    as well as the Franco-Vietnamian settlement concluded by the
                                    agreement of March 8 and its expected consequences, give the
                                    French Government great hopes of being able to present the
                                    candidacy of the three Associated States of Indochina to the UN
                                    Organization in the near future.</p>

                                <item>In my view the Indochina problem should be considered by the
                                    US in a completely cold-blooded fashion. If as some observers
                                    contend, it is a matter of indifference to American security and
                                    political interests whether or not that country falls completely
                                    under Communist domination, then we are wasting our time in
                                    reflecting upon possible courses of action calculated to
                                    compress and suppress Communism there. If, however, as I
                                    personally believe very strongly, we as a nation have a vital
                                    interest in the establishment and maintenance in Indochina of a
                                    non-Communist government, we must reconcile ourselves to the <pb
                                        n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0120"/>necessity of adopting
                                    such practical measures as might at least give us an expectancy
                                    of bringing about this condition.</item>

                                <item>I assume that no responsible American official believes that
                                    we can afford to take a chance that Asiatic Communism will in a
                                    reasonable future become a national Communism more friendly to
                                    US than to the USSR or that a round-table conference at which
                                    Bao Dai and Ho Chi Minh would sit as equals could result at best
                                    in more than a dangerous stalemate or, more probably, in the
                                    victory of the latter.</item>

                                        <item>On the negative side, no French Cabinet would survive
                                            the running of the Parliamentary gauntlet if it
                                            suggested the withdrawal at present or in the near
                                            future of French troops from Indochina. Such above
                                            besides the powerful opposition to it generated by
                                            considerations of national pride and prestige, of
                                            financial commitments and of sentimental ties would
                                            probably result in the massacre of tens of thousands of
                                            French civilians and anti-Communist Vietnamese as well
                                            as severe military losses to the troops covering
                                            evacuation. Shipping is not available in sufficient
                                            tonnage even to begin an operation of such magnitude
                                            whose only possible success would depend upon its being
                                            carried out with great speed. Other logistical
                                            considerations would be equally adverse.</item>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>At present no French Government could remain in power
                                            that advocated complete independence either now or in
                                            the future for Indochina, if by complete independence we
                                            mean that the country would not form a portion of the
                                            French Union. Public opinion in France is unalterable on
                                            this point and only the Communists and some left-wing
                                            Socialists would give support to such a notion. The
                                            French profess their willingness to abandon colonialism
                                            in all its forms as rapidly as is consistent with
                                            security, and feel that March 8 agreements are already a
                                            pledge of their good faith in that connection, but they
                                            sincerely believe and I agree that the maintenance of
                                            Vietnam in the union is the only present method by which
                                            Communism can be contained and a stable state created.
                                            Also, it should be observed that the parable of the mote
                                            applies to the French as well as to other nations. They
                                            do not feel any consciousness of having on balance
                                            grievously oppressed the native population or exploited
                                            it for their own exclusive benefit; on the contrary they

                                        Minh and his Communist associates and followers. Naturally,
                                        there are in France and in the overseas territories from
                                        which these soldiers derive a multitude of families who
                                        would rather have these men at home than dying under the
                                        stinking circumstances of jungle warfare many thousand miles
                                        away. But the necessity for such service is almost
                                        universally understood by those upon whom it imposes the
                                        heaviest sacrifices. In addition great as is the financial
                                        burden heaped upon the French nation by this thankless war,
                                        which swallowed up this year about half a billion dollars in
                                        expenses none of which will ever be recuperated, an amount
                                        which represents approximately the deficit in the national

                                        intention in the French Parliament, contentious though the
                                        subject be, of laying down this task and abandoning the
                                        conflict there. All this is a sentiment deep rooted in the
                                        national consciousness, despite the fact that while the best
                                        troops are engaged in these border skirmishes a far mightier
                                        enemy threatens, her Rhine borders stripped of men than
                                        otherwise would help in their defense.</p>

                                <item>I agree of course with the Department’s basic thesis of
                                    necessity wider popular support Bao Dai regime and important
                                    part played by widespread distrust of French as barrier to
                                    attainment of this popular support. I am convinced that there is
                                    no chance of French Government accepting the time table idea or
                                    the offer of international supervision, and that submission by
                                    US of these proposals which French Government could not possibly
                                    accept in view domestic political realities this subject would
                                    seriously prejudice the adoption of the program recommended
                                    below. In French view March 8 agreements supplemented by
                                    conventions now being negotiated at Saigon confer independence
                                    on Vietnam within French Union. Such limitations on sovereignty
                                    as will exist upon conclusion signing these agreements can
                                    gradually be removed when peaceful conditions restored and
                                    functioning non-Communist Viet government in control until
                                    something approaching or even exceeding dominion status is
                                    attained. As long as presence French Army, a certain number of
                                    trained French civil servants, and French financial support
                                    absolutely indispensable to maintenance non-Communist regime
                                    Indochina, a declaration of “complete independence for Vietnam
                                    at fixed future date” is out of question. I likewise believe
                                    that there is no chance of French accepting international
                                    supervision plan any more than the British would if it were
                                    suggested for Malaya. In addition factors national pride
                                    involved, almost universal revolt in French official and
                                    political life against what are considered unrealistic UN

                                    and might prejudice ratification agreements now pending. Also,
                                    even broadminded and liberal Frenchmen question necessity
                                    international supervision negotiations between partners, for it
                                    is as partners in struggle against Communist domination
                                    Indochina that French officials view Bao Dai and themselves.
                                    There is no parallel to Indonesian case. Some of the vitriolic
                                    native critics of the French, their freedom of speech and safety
                                    of person guaranteed by French bayonets, would cry lustily and
                                    despairingly if they were deprived of the military protection,
                                    the administrative assistance, and the subsidized economy which
                                    now defends them against terror, chaos and inflation. If there

                            <p>If the Department favors this program, it might consider the
                                desirability of discussing it with the British and, if agreed, its
                                presentation should be accompanied by a conditional offer of action
                                by the United States and United Kingdom of the points in paragraph
                                10. This presentation should be made quickly and should be designed
                                to elicit support if possible from Asian states. It may fail to
                                achieve results for various reasons such as internal Indochinese
                                complications or a decision by Mao Tse-tung for direct military
                                invasion of the peninsula. At present we are almost in a stalemate.
                                We are waiting for the French to act, the French are hoping that
                                help from us may make their internal political problem easier. Bao
                                Dai has improved his chances and has gathered increased strength but
                                is waiting for both of us. Any course of action we may decide upon
                                involves some risks but the greatest risk and one certain to
                                precipitate failure is that consequent upon continued inaction. A
                                view that Ho Chi Minh will inevitably take over Indochina is
                                dangerous and defeatist. We should <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"

                                the possible. If the above program is carried out, I believe it will

                                dealing with the burden imposed on the French public finances by
                                military expenditures in Indochina; a summary of the major lines of
                                the attached document was contained in Toeca 1435.</p>
                            <p>The enclosed memorandum highlights the fact that Indochinese
                                expenditures impose such a burden on the French public finances as
                                to constitute an important obstacle to the success of the whole
                                French recovery and stabilization effort. The 167 billion francs
                                spent in Indochina in 1949 is not only equivalent to over two-thirds
                                of the total direct American aid to France for 1949–50, but some ten
                                billion francs greater than the estimated French budgetary deficit
                                for the year; the sixty-billion franc excess over budgetary
                                estimates of actual <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-Chinese
                                expenditures in 1949 more than accounts for the operating deficit of
                                the French Treasury as of the end of 1949; and the year 1950 will
                                probably see the Treasury saddled with at least forty billion francs
                                more in unforeseen expenditures. It is clear that the struggle to
                                create conditions necessary for the continued growth of a
                                non-Communist Viet Government in Indochina, to which the French are
                                apparently irrevocably committed, constitutes for the moment a major
                                obstacle in the path of French financial stabilization and economic
                                progress, with all that that implies for the European Recovery
                                Program as a whole.</p>
                            <p>Unlike so many of the seemingly insoluble problems of the French
                                Treasury, the Indochinese problem is one the United States can do
                                something about. For in addition to taking the general political
                                measures recommended in the Embassy’s telegram 5197, measures
                                designed by strengthening Bao-Dai to shorten the period of necessary
                                military <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0127"/>activity, the
                                United States is in a position to take direct action to relieve the
                                French of at least a part of the financial burden of their
                                Indochinese commitment by making use of the special fund established
                                by the Mutual Defence Act of 1949. This double opportunity to resist
                                Communist expansion in Asia at one of its most dangerous points
                                while contributing directly to the maintenance of French economic
                                stability, is one which in my opinion the Department should
                                seriously consider.</p>

                                sufficiently well known to people this area to take edge off such

                                date for recognition Bao Dai. Strongly agree with Schuman’s argument
                                that British should recognize Bao Dai before Mao Tse-tung and hope
                                Department will urge British to delay latter. Opening of Colombo

                                mutual wish for clarity and careful preparation of difficult task
                                involved in transfer complicated government machinery.</p>
                            <p>Pignon then traced in some detail steps leading to Vietnam
                                independence mentioning declaration of June 5, 1948 (Baie d’Along
                                Agreement), March 8 accords and transfer sovereignty Cochin China to
                                Vietnam. In analyzing conventions to be signed emphasized they
                                represented conclusion process in effect since 1946 of transfer all
                                phases government administration to local and national authorities.
                                Referring to interestate conference “which would open in few weeks”
                                Pignon remarked that what remained of <gloss target="#t_Indo1"
                                    >Indo</gloss>-Chinese political unity would be broken up and
                                distributed among the individual states. He closed <pb n="117"
                                    xml:id="pg_117" facs="0131"/>this part of speech with remark
                                that present state of insecurity which required presence French
                                Union troops in many areas might hide to casual observer fact that
                                henceforth sovereignty was in Vietnam hands. This fact would appear
                                clearly when peace returned.</p>
                            <p>“Equipped with all the attributes of state power, Vietnam will now
                                appear on international scene”. Admission to family of nations
                                requires fulfillment of certain conditions. Vietnam Government by
                                its policy, both internal and external, Vietnam people, through
                                their national unity must earn right to join family of nations. High
                                Commissioner then referred to admission to <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1"
                                    >ECAFE</gloss> and to messages received from “highest spiritual
                                and temporal authorities” as forecasting future recognition. French
                                diplomacy using all its influence with its friends and allies. “I
                                have reason to believe that numerous friendly governments are
                                waiting only for French Parliament to ratify March 8 accords to take
                                this step. I am certain this condition will be soon fulfilled,
                                French Government having announced that it will undertake
                                ratification procedure without delay.”</p>
                            <p>Pignon then spoke of recent grave threat of Chinese Nationalist
                                troops entering Tonkin followed by Communist forces. This
                                catastrophe avoided by French diplomatic action backed by French
                                troops. This striking example of value membership in French Union
                                and proof in this dangerous atomic age no state can live in
                                isolation.</p>
                            <p>Tone of Bao Dai’s reply in some contrast to that of High Commissioner
                                and indicated continued lack confidence in continuity French policy.
                                Emphasized six months had passed before symbolic gesture of June 14
                                achieved practical realization. Addressed particular cordial thanks
                                to Pignon for part in developments.</p>
                            <p>Warned developments in Vietnam must no longer be referred to as an
                                experiment but must be considered in France and Vietnam as
                                definitive and only policy can safeguard mutual interests. Assurance
                                given by High Commissioner of ratification March 8 accords gives
                                hope this view shared by French people. “It is encouraging to hear
                                from you formal assurances that French Government will continue in
                                this new policy”. In its support of democratic principles and
                                respect for individual liberty Vietnam feels it has earned sympathy
                                of concert of nations. For this reason “Vietnam state attaches great
                                importance to international recognition which our government will
                                endeavor to obtain with the support of the French Republic”. We will
                                justify recognition by our unity, our labor and by clear expression
                                of our international policy. Between two streams of ideas tending to
                                divide world our people have the duty to choose that fitting their
                                temperament. Because of ideals they defend great western powers are
                                bound to guarantee our integrity and our independence. Vietnam will
                                grant its confidence <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0132"/>to the
                                countries which offer it sincere friendship and which assure their
                                support in defense of its rights. Basing our policy on the above
                                principles I am confident of support from my people. “Supported
                                externally by friendship of great democratic nations, associated
                                with France by agreements which derive their force from loyal
                                cooperation and progressive adaptation to modern ways of living, we
                                will construct our independence upon a basis of fraternity and
                                justice.” Bao Dai’s speech in Vietnamese broadcast on nationwide
                                hookup was primarily call for unity and appeal to resistance and
                                fence-sitters. Also made clear Vietnam sides with democratic powers
                                in world ideological struggle and called for diplomatic recognition
                                and moral and material assistance from them.</p>
                            <p>After praising work of Accord Committee which had negotiated
                                agreements in accord both with interests aspirations of people and
                                with practical reality, and warning against impotence in spirit
                                narrow nationalism, Emperor said real as opposed theoretical

                                International recognition which Vietnam sought must be earned. Ideal
                                of individual freedom defended by democratic great powers coincided
                                with Vietnamese tradition and way of life. We will maintain close
                                relations with them and neutral attitude towards other nations. Bao
                                Dai then issued call to all who had struggled for independence and
                                appeal “to those misled by false propaganda to return to right way.
                                Government will defend welfare of all regardless of party or belief
                                if they return to united national family.”</p>
                            <p>Speech closed with hope that message going out over new purely
                                Vietnam radio would reach not only 20,000,000 fellow citizens but

                                conditions precedent do I recommend that I be instructed to act as
                                intermediary/Department may of course view this as an entirely
                                unrealistic approach. I am not so sure that it is, Netherlands

                                real world criticism that threatens future confidence in
                                international organization as instrument of right and justice.
                                Reaction <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> promises to break into
                                that storm which may divide east from west irreparably. US may be
                                forced by Asiatic movement and/or popular sentiment in US and
                                Congress to cut off financial aid. If this likely be done
                                eventually, why not use now as lever for getting most possible out
                                of Netherlands for Indonesia while maintaining our own reputation

                                as political weapon, should we not be equally conscientious and
                                solicitous to see that funds given under guise economic recovery are
                                not used to conduct what is generally viewed as war of aggression
                                against a people seeking promised freedom?</p>
                            <p>9. If Department would come out separately at once, or promptly when
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> reconvenes, along lines above
                                indicated, its stand would be unequivocal and chances of Netherlands
                                taking more reasonable attitude toward Indonesia might be enhanced.
                                If Netherlands then still desirous use me as intermediary, US
                                position would be so clear that our government should not suffer,
                                whatever results obtained. While I am not sanguine I could help
                                effectively, I believe Republicans will not yield far toward
                                Netherlands position in absence third party. Any aid we give now
                                should be on our terms and not at behest of Netherlands while they
                                acting in disregard of all their international obligations.</p>

                                        not printed.</note> I am now in position to state that
                                    Netherlands Government has sent to Government of Indonesia
                                    necessary instructions to enable Committee Good Offices,
                                    Consular Commission and military observers to carry out task as
                                    formulated in sixth paragraph of Van Royen’s statement of
                                    December 27 and fourth paragraph of his statement of December
                                    29. In this connection, it is observed that Netherlands
                                    authorities as result of shortage of material will especially in
                                    beginning only be able to place at disposal of Committee Good
                                    Offices, Consular Commission and their military observers
                                    limited transport facilities. It is, therefore, suggested that
                                    Committee Good Offices use as much as possible its own aircraft
                                    and other means of transportation.</p>
                                <p>It will be clear that under present circumstances visit to some
                                    areas might be temporarily restricted as result of measures
                                    taken by Netherlands authorities for reasons of safety and
                                    military necessity. Moreover, it is pointed out that visits to
                                    certain areas may entail considerable personal risk for which
                                    Netherlands Government must disclaim responsibility.</p>
                                <p>Finally, it would be greatly appreciated if Committee Good
                                    Offices would outline its plans for performing task referred to
                                    above.</p>

                            <p>The Indian Ambassador opened the conversation by referring once again
                                to India’s deep concern over the situation in Indonesia, indicating
                                that India would appreciate being informed of the nature of the
                                action contemplated by the United States, and urging that the U.S.
                                stop <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid to Holland.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth stressed that the U.S. approach to the Indonesian
                                problem was multilateral through the United Nations and that a
                                resort to unilateral punishment of Holland by cancellation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> would establish a dangerous
                                precedent of attempting to achieve solutions to world problems by
                                direct individual nation approach and of employing economic aid to
                                achieve political goals. He mentioned that Ambassador Henderson had
                                already explained this to Sir Girja Bajpai, Secretary General of
                                India’s Ministry of External Affairs, and that Bajpai had indicated
                                his belief that Prime Minister Nehru now understood that the U.S.
                                could not afford to set such a precedent. Sir Benegal said that he
                                appreciated the fact that India and the U.S. had the same over-all
                                objectives in this problem but that he could not help but feel that
                                if the U.S. took a determined stand with the Western European
                                countries, making our further participation in the Western Union and
                                the continuation of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> assistance
                                contingent upon their support in the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>, effective action could be achieved. Mr. Rusk <pb
                                    n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0138"/>pointed out that in
                                addition to the very great undesirability of our resorting to the
                                use of economic instruments to achieve political aims, there was
                                considerable question as to how effective the cancellation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid to Holland would actually be in
                                view of the position of the Government of Holland vis-à-vis its own
                                people. In so far as the U.S. assuming a full “chips are down”
                                attitude toward the Indonesian problem, Mr. Rusk said that the whole
                                future of the UN was involved in such a question as it would be
                                difficult to choose which of numerous equally clear and equally
                                important problems, such as the Berlin, Greek, or Palestine
                                situations, the U.S. should attempt to solve by forcing other
                                members of the UN to vote the way we wanted them to. He pointed out
                                that it was obvious that such an approach, if adopted at all, could
                                only result in the ultimate destruction of the UN, the support of
                                which is the comer stone of both Indian and American foreign policy.
                                Mr. Satterthwaite pointed out that he was confident that the
                                Government of India would really be the last to wish to see the U.S.
                                undertake a policy so close to “economic imperialism” as utilization
                                of an <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> program in the manner
                                suggested would be.</p>
                            <p>Reverting to the question of the Western Union, the Ambassador
                                discussed at length the position in which the Far East would be
                                placed, in his opinion, should the U.S. be successful in halting the
                                spread of communism in Europe through this channel. He felt that
                                such a halting would only mean that Russia would then turn the full
                                force of its attentions to the Far East and specifically to India,
                                which stands today as the only remaining effective stabilizing
                                influence in the area. Mr. Butterworth said that in his opinion such
                                would not be the result in as much as no matter how successful the
                                Western Union might be as a military alliance, Russia would
                                certainly not cease its efforts in Europe and that in any event the
                                communists would follow every channel available to them for
                                ideological propagation in the Far East regardless of developments
                                in Europe. He said that rather than the Western Union it was
                                unfortunate developments such as the current one hi Indonesia which
                                provided the stimuli to communism in its focusing on the Far
                                East.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Satterthwaite said that speaking of such incidents, he wished to
                                take this opportunity to tell the Ambassador how very pleased we
                                were over the measures adopted by India and Pakistan in the Kashmir
                                problem and how hopeful we now were of an effective solution. The
                                Ambassador replied that India’s action in agreeing to the proposals
                                of the UN Commission on Kashmir was indicative of India’s urgent
                                need for, and devotion to, the maintenance of peace. He pointed out
                                that India had agreed to the further conditions despite the fact
                                that the original report of the Commission had shown that it was <pb
                                    n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0139"/>Pakistan which had been at
                                fault throughout. In particular he emphasized that India is
                                interested in peace “frankly for selfish reasons” and that it must
                                have peace if it is to achieve its economic and sociological growth
                                which he said was the only hope of maintaining a democratic state in
                                Asia today.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Rusk asked the Ambassador on the Indonesian question as to
                                whether or not the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had any
                                suggestions as to a practicable approach in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that he did
                                not have any such suggestions in his instructions and that he
                                understood that the 13-nation conference being called by the Indian
                                Prime Minister was for the purpose of determining in what ways the
                                nations of the Near and Far East could be effective within the
                                machinery of the UN on this one question. He said that in particular
                                his instructions were to inquire as to the future plans of the U.S.
                                Mr. Butterworth explained that the U.S. was in a difficult position
                                in that its moderately worded resolution had failed to achieve a
                                majority support in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Mr. Rusk
                                added that he thought it was possible that the European countries,
                                including the Dutch, were more aware now than they had been at the
                                time the resolution failed to pass, of the strength of the negative
                                reaction of the American people to the Dutch action. He suggested
                                that we would be interested in keeping in close touch with the
                                Ambassador particularly following Dr. Jessup’s<note n="2"

                                return from Europe at the end of the week. The Ambassador said that
                                he was very anxious indeed to have another meeting before leaving
                                for New York to represent India before the Security Council. The
                                conversation was terminated with an agreement that such a meeting
                                would be set up after Dr. Jessup’s return.</p>

                                and must have reached unit commanders much later. When asked at

                                said Republican Artillery Commander had not been informed of order
                                by Netherlands and stated “there no need inform opponents since
                                whole Java occupied. There is no regular Republican Army any more.”
                                When asked what happened Republican Army 200,000 men, spokesman
                                replied “only Commander in Chief Netherlands Army can answer you.”

                                cease-fire acceptance, spokesman answered “when they wish to follow

                                referring all queries to Hague from which apparently no truly

                                risk of seeming to condone Netherlands action without possibility of

                                    General Staff neither of whom was in Batavia at time.
                                    Representative of Chief of Staff undertook to advise chairman of
                                    committee’s <gloss target="#t_MilEx1">MilEx</gloss> Board when a
                                    decision was made by Commander in Chief so that further meeting
                                    could be held. Up to 16 hours today, 46 hours later, nothing has
                                    been received from him.</p>
                                <p>Committee had studied Van Royen’s statements in Security Council
                                    on 27 and 29 December appended to your letter 3 January, texts
                                    of your letters and transcript of meeting with representative of
                                    Chief of your General Staff. It wishes to make sure that no
                                    misunderstanding exists as to its position.</p>
                                <p>In your letter 4 January you state that as no reply had yet been
                                    received from Consular Commission to letter similar to that of 3
                                    January addressed to committee ‘discussions can only bear
                                    provisional character and cannot prejudice performance of task
                                    entrusted to Consular Commission’. You further state that
                                    coordination of plan of committee and of Consular Commission
                                    will be necessary as far as Netherlands and Indonesian
                                    authorities are concerned’. Similarly, Colonel Thomson,
                                    representative of your Chief of Staff, after querying at some
                                    length status of military observers in relationship to Committee
                                    Good Offices and to Consular Commission, stated: ‘But still
                                    there is this confusion about existence of two committees; if
                                    Security Council will notify us or either of committees about
                                    exact position that will then help us greatly in going ahead
                                    with our part of task’. Again he stated, ‘We consider
                                    clarification of confusion regarding functions of <gloss
                                        target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and Consular Commission as very
                                    important’. This is one of matters to be referred to decision of
                                    Commander in Chief and Chief of Staff before arrangements can be
                                    begun.</p>
                                <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0144"/>
                                <p>In view of committee, there is no confusion of type which should
                                    delay it in performance of its urgent duty to report. Any
                                    position on part of your government preventing early return of
                                    military observers to field until ‘confusion’ has been clarified
                                    would in effect paralyze both organs of Security Council at
                                    crucial time.</p>
                                <p>What is important is timely resumption by military observers of
                                    their functions already in suspension over entire period in
                                    which their reporting would have been of greatest value and not
                                    irrelevant debate as to manner in which their reports will be
                                    channeled to Security Council whether through committee or
                                    through Consular Commission.</p>
                                <p>We wish further to correct tendency seen in meeting held with
                                    representative of Chief of Staff to limit unduly scope of work
                                    to be done by military observers. There were many references to
                                    military observers as having only function of observing
                                    ‘cessation of hostilities’ now that, as Colonel Thomson put it,
                                    ‘there is no longer any truce, there is no longer any <gloss
                                        target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>, and there is no longer long
                                    list of truce infringements’. Broad scope of observations to be
                                    carried on by military observers is very clearly expressed in
                                    paragraph six of statement made on 27 December in Security
                                    Council by Van Royen, Netherlands representative:</p>
                                <p>‘In order enable Committee to carry out its instructions to
                                    report on situation after December 12, Netherlands Government
                                    has issued instructions that military experts at disposal of
                                    committee and their staff be given opportunity to study course
                                    of events. I am authorized to add that this last provision means
                                    in practice that to use words of Committee Good Offices itself,
                                    military observers can again be dispatched to field’. It is
                                    feared that position of your government is not fully understood
                                    at all levels by those who are charged with making of
                                    arrangements.</p>
                                <p>It is obvious, of course, that military observers can in practice
                                    return to field only if your government permits them to do so.
                                    Further, as they are dependent to very great extent on
                                    facilities and opportunities provided by your field commanders,
                                    they must operate if at all in accordance with limitations you
                                    see fit to impose. However, you will appreciate that committee
                                    must comply with instructions given to it by Security Council.
                                    It cannot in any way consent to or tacitly condone by acceptance
                                    any limitation on activities of military observers, which would
                                    prevent them from performing fully obligations imposed on
                                    them.</p>
                                <p>Ten days have passed since statement of Van Royen quoted above;
                                    almost two weeks since adoption by Security Council of
                                    resolution of 24 December. Not one military observer is yet in
                                    process of returning to field from which, as set forth in our
                                    letter of 23 December, military observers were excluded by
                                    Netherlands Army officials soon after hostilities were begun.
                                    Committee must emphasize that passing of time and progress of
                                    military action may well destroy value to committee and to
                                    Security Council of direct observations of military observers by
                                    whom alone in many cases can committee procure first-hand
                                    information needed for reports called for by resolution of
                                    Security Council of 24 December.</p>

                                    that the quick military successes of the Netherlands forces will
                                    not constitute a solution of the problem. The Indonesian
                                    situation cannot be solved by force. A solution of this problem
                                    remains matter of international concern with which the Council
                                    must continue to deal. The United States Government cannot
                                    associate itself with any aspect of the recent Netherlands

                            <p>14. As pointed out December 26 report, task imposed upon Committee by

                                outset. These difficulties include absence demarcation lines between
                                armed forces of parties, impossibility establishing contact with
                                Republican forces and extreme difficulty distinguishing hostilities

                            <p>15. Despite statements to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> by
                                Netherlands representatives 27 and 29 December, Committee has not

                                resolution. As a result failure Netherlands to authorize or
                                facilitate return Committee’s military observers to field, they
                                temporarily immobilized Batavia and Bandung without opportunities
                                observation. Heard unofficially and informally that certain military

                                took advantage Netherlands offer to conduct them on tour some
                                military areas 5 and 6 January. These officers not military

                                Committee even if their tour was type field investigations and
                                observation required by functions of committee.</p>
                            <p>16. If Committee is to continue to function, it requested <gloss

                                December. Inability to determine whether functions of one are at
                                this point exclusive of other or concurrent, and problem of to whom
                                military observers are primarily responsible has already created

                                have already been subject of report. Committee also called upon in

                                continuing reporting function, that of reporting to Council on
                                “events which have transpired in Indonesia since 12 December.”
                                Inability of Committee to carry out effectively this direction as

                                        from that body. This action is to be taken because we warned
                                        the Dutch that we would do so, because Mr. Cochran believes
                                        it should be done, and because the Committee of Good Offices
                                        can no longer serve any purpose in Indonesia save to act as
                                        a smokescreen for the pursuit by the Netherlands of its
                                        plans in that area.</item>

                            <p>Mr. van Kleffens and Mr. Helb called at their request to discuss
                                Security Council action in the Indonesian case. Mr. van Kleffens
                                expressed <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0154"/>the fear that
                                another proposal for the withdrawal of Dutch troops from Republican
                                territory would be offered in the Security Council. He stated that
                                his Government could not acquiesce in such a proposal, in as much as
                                chaos would result in the evacuated territory and the Netherlands
                                Government was determined to carry through its obligation to launch
                                a free and independent United States of Indonesia under conditions
                                which would give it the best chances of success. He stressed the
                                point that Queen Juliana’s recent speech and other official
                                pronouncements of his Government were sufficient evidence to the
                                world of the Dutch intentions to grant sovereignty to a United
                                States of Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>I replied that the Indonesian problem had been blown up, as a result
                                of Dutch military action, to a point where it was extremely
                                difficult to handle. I said that public and Congressional opinion
                                might force us in a direction which would be extremely adverse to
                                the interests both of the Netherlands and of the United States,
                                including jeopardizing <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid to
                                Holland and the North Atlantic Security Pact. To the Ambassador’s
                                arguments that public reaction was unjust to the Dutch, and to his
                                contention that American public opinion was split on this question,
                                I replied that we had to face the political reality of an extremely
                                adverse reaction to the Dutch attack and that what the Dutch have
                                stated as their intentions in Indonesia was not sufficient to take
                                the heat out of the situation. I said that I could not recommend
                                what they should do but felt strongly that they should do something
                                positive as an earnest of their <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi>. I
                                particularly mentioned the release of the Republican leaders and
                                stated that while I did not know whether the Netherlands could name
                                a date for the transfer of sovereignty, I felt that something along
                                that line might be the answer. I mentioned particularly the serious
                                possibilities inherent in the Asian conference called by Nehru.</p>
                            <p>Mr. van Kleffens went on to explain where the Dutch would move from
                                here. He stated on the one hand that the Republican leaders had
                                seemed to welcome liberation by the Dutch from their extremist
                                following, and, on the other hand, that Hatta’s influence and
                                popularity seemed to be declining in Java because of the fact that
                                he is a Sumatran. He stated it was the intention of the Netherlands
                                Prime Minister, Mr. Drees, now in Batavia, to sample public opinion
                                with a view to finding out who might represent the Republican state
                                in the interim government which the Dutch expect to form shortly.
                                Ambassador van Kleffens requested that this Government do what it
                                could to resist a “desperate move” in the Security Council,
                                affirming that his Government would not wish to be placed in a
                                position of nonconformity with Security Council action.</p>
                            <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0155"/>
                            <p>I made it very clear that the situation was one in which “almost
                                anything could happen”, and that I was greatly disturbed, although
                                not completely surprised, by developments since the Dutch undertook
                                military action.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador van Kleffens said that he would convey the gist of our
                                conversation immediately to his Government.</p>

                                be in position of three at Prapat as discussed above. If not,
                                Schuurman not prepared to say what effect failure to give

                                This question he felt was purely speculative. Said Netherlands not

                                official invitation visit Drees this morning at Palace. At meeting
                                Drees said Netherlands now desirous negotiating with real Republican
                                officials. Not willing to deal with Sukarno and Hatta because they
                                were “Japanese collaborationists,” but willing recognize Sjahrir as
                                outstanding Republican. Drees wanted discuss with Soepomo settlement
                                under which Republican officials would support participation in work
                                of Federalist Interim Government. According to Soepomo, he refused

                                Netherlands unless these preliminary conditions met. Drees said in
                                conciliatory manner that (1) was obviously impossible and that (2)
                                could not be carried out because in many areas local populations did
                                not want to be under Republican rule. He cited populations of South

                            <p>With reference to (3) above, Drees said Netherlands could not consent
                                any participation by <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, that
                                    “<gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> was not impartial

                                that once in Sumatra or on Bangka they will not be permitted return

                                from Drees and said Netherlands will go ahead with their “national

                            <p>32. Our telegram No. 30, January 12, contains suggested draft of
                                resolution on Indonesia. In my opinion, general ideas contained in
                                this draft represent substantial concession to necessary face saving
                                of Dutch and practical minimum of what US position in this case
                                requires, taking into account all elements. Department is aware that
                                all delegations are looking to us for leadership in resolution. A
                                resolution along foregoing lines would, in my opinion, attract very
                                general support. Timetable and general situation in Council
                                indicates strong desirability of clearance of a draft resolution by
                                Department so that we may receive instructions by Friday morning
                                with a view to consultation with other delegations before <gloss

                            <p>Earlier conversations today with Hood, Australia, and Rau, India,
                                indicate that they also would support resolution along these lines.
                                Hood has abandoned his former insistence on withdrawal to truce
                                lines and welcomes suggestion of general nature included in our
                                draft. Rau lays particular emphasis on importance of continuing
                                existing personnel of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> but
                                considers question of change in its title and powers a matter of
                                tactics in regard to which he would defer to our judgment.</p>
                            <p>Foregoing points have been discussed in conversations referred to <pb
                                    n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0162"/>above as general ideas

                                    >SC</gloss> yesterday and as not representing any official

                                ready for at least private circulation so that delegates could
                                secure instructions over the weekend. Cadogan stated that if he
                                could see our draft before he speaks in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> Friday afternoon, he would try to frame his

                                Apparently little Netherlands military action against it. In fact
                                recent reports Atjenese taking offensive. We discussed possible
                                political and legal significance of fact that thus substantial

                                can be carried on for decades. Supomo agreed and explained that this
                                is reason why Republic believes it preferable to have Netherlands

                                    letter to make it very clear that, so far as the Republic was
                                    concerned, the path of peaceful negotiation was still open.
                                    Despite the failure of all the approaches I had made, I was
                                    still confident, as I stated in the letter, that ‘reasonable men
                                    can and must agree when the consequences of disagreement are so
                                    serious to both parties.’ The consequences of disagreement have
                                    been more than serious. My own fate, political or personal, is
                                    unimportant. But, in the space of four weeks, I have seen my
                                    country torn by warfare; thousands of my fellow countrymen dead
                                    or cruelly wounded, many women and children among them; villages
                                    and towns burned or deserted and tens of thousands homeless;
                                    starvation widespread. This is the price we are willing to pay
                                    for our freedom. I wonder if the consequences of this unworthy
                                    war have not been even more serious to the Netherlands.
                                    Indonesia, which as a partner could richly reward from its
                                    potential wealth a Netherlands which would make freely available
                                    its experience: and services, will now at best be a continuing
                                    drain on the Netherlands economy. The Netherlands will find its
                                    youth subject to the continuing, and ever-increasing resistance
                                    of our guerrillas, a resistance which can and will continue
                                    until complete victory is achieved, whether it takes one month
                                    or ten years. I wonder if the Netherlands will not have to pay a
                                    price even greater than that represented by its young men and
                                    wealth. What can be the effect on the spirit of a people,
                                    themselves free, when they devote themselves to the enslavement
                                    of another people? May not their own freedom perish when they
                                    give themselves over to the path of military conquest?</p>
                                <p>I am heartened by the wave of sympathy which has flowed from the
                                    hearts of the people of the United States and those of the other
                                    peace-loving nations of the world, a sympathy which as I see it
                                    knows no race or creed, no division between east and west. I
                                    could expect no less from your people who themselves resisted
                                    the colonialism of a former age and laid down those principles
                                    of freedom and liberty which I have read in your Declaration of
                                    Independence.</p>
                                <p>I have not given up my trust in the United Nations and in its
                                    ability to find a fair solution. I know that it will not abandon
                                    us in our hour of need.</p>
                                <p>I affirm again my faith that only by the processes of democracy
                                    can a lasting settlement be obtained, that colonialism is dead,
                                    that the aspirations of a freedom-loving people for a government
                                    of their own cannot be long denied.</p>
                                <p>A great American spoke of ‘one world’. I know that the modern
                                    world is one, that there cannot be a division into east and
                                    west, that all nations must cooperate for their mutual good. We
                                    need the west as the west needs the east. I do not hate the
                                    people of the Netherlands. I do hate the policy of military
                                    conquests which they are following. I regret that they and so
                                    many officials of their government have been deceived</p>
                                <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0168"/>
                                <p>I know and admire their struggles for freedom in the past. May
                                    they now seize the opportunity to give an example to the modern
                                    world, that of a people who will voluntarily surrender that
                                    which they hoped to win by force and heed the conscience of the
                                    world which tells them they have erred.</p>
                                <p>I know that you, Mr. Cochran, have seen the people of the
                                    Republic at their work, in their patriotic exercises, in their
                                    moments of recreation. I know that you must have come to realize
                                    that the Republic is not a mere governmental structure. I think
                                    you will be able to explain to your associates that the real
                                    strength of the Republic is in the hearts of the people of
                                    Indonesia, a fortress which cannot be taken by the assaults of
                                    tanks and bombers.</p>
                                <p>I have not attempted to suggest in this letter any definite plan
                                    of settlement. I must leave that to a time when my status is
                                    again that of one free to negotiate and not merely free to
                                    surrender.</p>
                                <p>I trust that I shall see you again very soon and at a happier
                                    time for my country, perhaps when a free and sovereign United
                                    States of Indonesia has been achieved. That it will be achieved
                                    cannot be doubted by those who know the Republic and the
                                    affection in which it is held by all the people of
                                    Indonesia.</p>
                                <p>I shall ask Mr. Lisle to make sure that this letter reaches you.

                                carrying out its constructive program, details of which are

                                <item>In order to carry this firm program into effect, discussions
                                    are to take place, a beginning with which has already been made
                                    in the course of the last few days. Continuously increasing
                                    intervention on the part of foreign countries as well as
                                    increasing interference by the Commission of Good Offices in the
                                    situation in the shape of reports to the Security Council which
                                    are not free from bias, result in delaying the realisation of
                                    the aims which are those of the Netherlands as much as they are
                                    those of the countless people outside the Netherlands, rather
                                    than in advancing it.</item>

                            <p>In addition to these reasons of a general political nature, the
                                attitude of the Netherlands Government in respect of the United
                                States working-paper is motivated by the following special
                                considerations:</p>
                            <p>Adoption of the paper would in effect be a premium on the
                                Republicans’ attitude of non-cooperation, for the reason that it
                                holds out to the former Republican leaders the prospect of a
                                position in Java, Sumatra and Madura which is so greatly at variance
                                with possibilities as they are in reality that these leaders are
                                encouraged to adopt a negative attitude in respect of the
                                discussions which have begun between the Netherlands Prime Minister,
                                the Government of Indonesia and the federal nationalists for the
                                purpose of establishing a federal interim government.</p>
                            <p>Should the United States working-paper be presented to the Security
                                Council as a draft-resolution and should that draft-resolution be
                                adopted despite Netherlands warnings and objections, the only result
                                will be increased unrest, a delayed peaceful and satisfactory
                                solution, and a multiplication of existing difficulties.</p>
                            <p>The Netherlands Government has pledged itself in the most solemn
                                manner, both as regards Indonesia and the Netherlands Nation
                                represented by the States-General, to do its utmost to abide by its
                                promises and to carry out its declared program. In its details the
                                scheme set forth in the United States working-paper is inconsistent
                                with that program, which is now anchored in the Netherlands
                                Constitution as a result of a recent constitutional amendment. In
                                addition, a Decree has been worked out on a basis, of consultation
                                with a comprehensive group of Indonesian leaders, in which
                                provisions are laid down for the admininstration of Indonesia in the
                                interim period, and containing a clause (article 69) by virtue of
                                which this Decree can be altered after consulting Republican
                                leaders.</p>

                                    result that yet another element is added to the growing number
                                    of Asian states which as a consequence of internal weakness fall

                            <p>In the opinion of the Netherlands Government there can be no doubt
                                that, in assuming jurisdiction in the Indonesian question (which is
                                what the Security Council would do if it were to adopt the United
                                States working-paper), that Council would far exceed the measure of
                                its intervention in other disputes now before it, thereby creating a
                                dangerous precedent for the future. Unquestionably this degree of
                                intervention is in derogation of article 2 paragraph 7 of the
                                Charter of the United Nations, and creates the danger that faith in
                                the Charter is undermined.</p>
                            <p>In its appeal to the Netherlands Government alone to cease military
                                operations, the United States working-paper ignores the fact that
                                the Netherlands Government some considerable time ago caused
                                hostilities to be stopped whilst on the other hand on the part of
                                the Republic no order has ever been issued to its armed forces to
                                observe army resolutions. This, incidentally, is wholly consistent
                                with conditions as they existed prior to the beginning of the recent
                                operation, the Republican Government having little or no authority
                                over its armed forces, the remnants of which have now completely
                                disintegrated.</p>
                            <p>Re-establishment of the Republican Government, at first, it is true,
                                in the city of Djokjakarta, but later on, in the discretion of a
                                United Nations Commission, in the whole of Java, Sumatra and Madura,
                                is wholly unacceptable. The Netherlands, until next year sovereignty
                                is transferred, is not only the sovereign power, but at present also
                                exercises <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authority. The possibility
                                cannot be countenanced that, as result of the adoption of the United
                                States working-paper, there would come into being a second, parallel
                                Government. In addition, it should not be forgotten that this paper
                                proposes to grant a priori to the republic a dominant position in
                                the federation, thus derogating from the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Renville</hi> principle which prescribes that it will be the
                                people itself which will determine to what state it wants to
                                belong.</p>

                                on important points, and which the Netherlands Government could not
                                accept.</p>
                            <p>Nor could the Netherlands Government see its way to accepting the
                                extension of the powers of the Commission of Good Offices to be
                                transformed according to the United States working-paper into a
                                Commission for Indonesia, inasmuch as:</p>

                                <item>it would appear that the sphere of action of the Commission is
                                    to be extended to the whole of Indonesia, in other words: to
                                    areas which were no party to the dispute between the Netherlands
                                    and the Republic of Indonesia. The Security Council, it seems,
                                    would extend its jurisdiction to regions where there is no
                                    dispute at all;</item>

                                <item>the Commission is to take decisions by a majority vote, which
                                    means in effect that the United States member is to act as an
                                    administrator during the interim period, a construction which is
                                    incompatible with the responsibilities and duties devolving for
                                    the Netherlands from its sovereignty during that period;</item>

                                <item>the contemplated powers of the Commission far exceed those
                                    which any organ of the United Nations possesses in the territory
                                    of any other state. This would seem to constitute a dangerous
                                    precedent for similar interference on the part of the Security
                                    Council in Malaya, <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China,
                                    and even in countries where conflicts exist between national

                            <p>It seems inadmissible that the Commission should have discretionary
                                power to determine which parts of Java, Sumatra and Madura will
                                revert to the Republic and where Netherlands troops will be allowed
                                to remain to maintain order. Existing provisional political organs
                                would thus be destroyed against the freely expressed will of the
                                people; the areas concerned would become ungovernable, existing
                                constructive nationalism being denied further possibilities to
                                express its desires. During the interim period the Commission would
                                in reality become an organ having wide powers of administration; in
                                the exercise of these powers it could make use of such means as it
                                considers proper in its own judgment, whilst at the same time
                                responsibility for public order would continue to rest with the
                                Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Re-instatement of the Republican Government, coupled with giving it
                                facilities throughout Indonesia, would not only open up
                                possibilities for fruitful activity on the part of Tan Malakka,
                                trained in Moscow, and his communist associates whose influence was
                                previously confined to Republican territory, but would also extend
                                Republican power far beyond its previous scope. To the Netherlands
                                this would be utterly unacceptable, in addition to being
                                inconsistent with elementary requirements of impartiality.</p>
                            <p>According to the United States working-paper, a date would be set <pb
                                    n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0175"/>for holding elections
                                without any evidence being shown in that paper that the need is
                                acknowledged of conditions having to be brought about beforehand
                                guaranteeing free and democratic elections. There is, furthermore,
                                no indication as to how such elections are to be held in a country
                                where the population has not been registered, where the rate of
                                illiteracy is a special difficulty, and where so far the formation
                                of political parties has hardly developed beyond the rudimentary
                                stage, difficulties such as have been and to some extent are still
                                being experienced also in India, various Arab countries, and
                                elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>It is not possible to make use of Republican armed forces in
                                restoring peaceful conditions, for the simple reason that it was
                                these very armed forces who before the recent operation were the
                                main cause of unrest and disorder in and beyond Republican
                                territory, forces moreover who since have split up in roving gangs
                                which for the time being are the chief element threatening security
                                and public peace.</p>
                            <p>According to the United States working-paper, the Netherlands
                                Government is in practice to be obliged to place its public organs
                                at the disposal of the Security Council to ensure that the wishes of
                                the proposed commission be carried into effect, a commission which
                                is to carry out experiments in territory of a sovereign state
                                without there being any assurance that the agreed
                                Netherlands-Indonesian Union will come into being. As a matter of
                                honor, of conscience, and of policy, no Netherlands Government could
                                accept such a state of things.</p>
                            <p>The Netherlands Government, far from wishing to limit itself to a
                                negative reaction with regard to the United States working-paper, is
                                now working on positive suggestions for a final resolution for the
                                consideration of the Security Council, to be presented at the
                                earliest possible moment.</p>

                            <p>54. Van Roijen called to see me at my invitation this morning. We
                                talked very frankly on a friendly personal basis for nearly an hour.
                                He laid stress on his feeling that both Dubois<note n="2"

                                    1948.</note> and Cochran were prejudiced in their point of view.
                                He said that our draft resolution had made any solution impossible
                                and expressly declared that this <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                                    facs="0176"/>statement was based on a telephone conversation
                                with Stikker this morning. His main objection seemed to be that it
                                was based on a complete denial of the possibility of Dutch good
                                faith, and said no self-respecting government could accept such a
                                position. He said if the US intended to put on enough pressure to
                                drive the Netherlands out of Indonesia he supposed they could do it,
                                but they preferred “to go down fighting.” He had little new to say

                                consolidated the determination of the Dutch Cabinet to go ahead with
                                police action and that it had destroyed the possibility of
                                moderation. We discussed at some length the question of the survival
                                of the Republic as an entity and he conceded my point that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> could scarcely accept their
                                theory that they had wiped out the Republic with which they had made
                                agreements including the <hi rend="italic">Renville</hi> agreement
                                under the auspices of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. In
                                answer to a specific question, he said that his government did not
                                take the position that the Linggadjati and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Renville</hi> agreements no longer existed but insisted that
                                certain of their provisions had been modified by events although the
                                principles of those agreements were still accepted. He half admitted
                                my suggestion that in the case of the alleged violation of the
                                orders regarding the nature of the confinement of Hatta and the
                                others on Bangka, some of the Dutch officials on the spot had been
                                very extreme in their attitude and actions and had caused additional
                                difficulties. Van Roijen said he would be very grateful if we had
                                any further information concerning incidents of this kind if we
                                would let him know. I asked him whether he saw any possible bridge
                                between the position of his government and the position of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> which he recognized
                                particularly with reference to the continued existence of the
                                Republic and the restoration of its leaders. He said flatly that he
                                saw none. He did say that he wished we had had this talk before our
                                “working paper” had been distributed but I reminded him that the
                                views of the US had been perfectly clear to his government for a
                                long time. I also told him that on the basis of conversations with
                                most of the people at the council table it seemed to me there was a
                                general unanimity of view on most of the basic points.</p>
                            <p>So far as this conversation went, there was no indication that the
                                Dutch were prepared to accommodate themselves to any <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution whatever. In view of talks
                                with other members of the council, reported-separately, it seems to
                                me clear that we must proceed with a strong resolution although
                                certain minor amendments may be acceptable to the co-sponsors of the
                                resolution which would make it slightly more palatable. One lead
                                which Van Roijen gave was the suggestion <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163"
                                    facs="0177"/>that the resolution should include reference to the

                                    French delegation at the United Nations.</note> in conversation
                                with <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> today took a very strong
                                line referring several times to the possibility that they would find
                                it necessary to veto a resolution and insisting that the basic point
                                was non-extension of the good offices principle. The French cannot
                                contemplate any extension of powers for any UN body in the
                                Indonesian question. While I personally doubt whether the French
                                will veto, such action on their part would throw the whole onus of
                                responsibility on their shoulders. Since it would clearly be based
                                on an argument concerning the competence of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, I believe we should be prepared at
                                that point to introduce at once a resolution submitting the question
                                of competence to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> for an
                                advisory opinion. If resolution in some such form as now drafted is
                                adopted by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and if Dutch should
                                immediately walk out or give notice of refusal to comply, believe we
                                should be prepared to indicate our position.</p>
                            <p>Since next meeting of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is scheduled
                                for Wednesday afternoon, introduction of our resolution cannot be
                                delayed beyond that time. Strongly recommend that if anything is to
                                be done along lines of bilateral approach, it should precede
                                possible further Dutch statement at that time.</p>

                            <p>56. The following is our revised draft of a resolution on Indonesia
                                which takes into account, insofar as possible, the views of other
                                delegations consulted by us, and in particular Norway, Cuba, and
                                China. We believe the latter three delegations would join the US in
                                sponsoring such a resolution.</p>

                                <item>Supomo and Sudjono called late today. Sjahrir has arrived in
                                    Batavia and has been permitted to live in own house and told he
                                    can see people freely during his stay Batavia. He has explained
                                    to Supomo circumstances under which he accepted invitation to
                                    come here. Yesterday he was visited by assistant resident in
                                    Prapat and asked to come Batavia. He thereupon consulted with
                                    Sukarno and Salim. Three of them do not have radio, receive only
                                    Aneta news and are very anxious for news of internal situation.
                                    They decided that Sjahrir should accept invitation only in order
                                    obtain latest information. Sukarno and <pb n="167"
                                        xml:id="pg_167" facs="0181"/>Salim received no invitation.
                                    As Hatta and other exiles on Bangka had visit from <gloss

                                    information, Supomo thinks Hatta will not accept similar
                                    invitation. <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> will probably
                                    call on Sjahrir tomorrow as group. Sjahrir assured Supomo that
                                    he will not enter into any negotiations with Drees or
                                    Federalists unless and until all Repub leaders are free and
                                    restored to positions of governmental authority. Sjahrir will
                                    have informal talk with Drees tonight. <gloss target="#t_USDel1"

                            <p>Following the meeting of the three of us this morning, I had two
                                telephone conversations with Dr. Jessup.</p>
                            <p>I told Dr. Jessup that we were interested in the situation in
                                Indonesia and were not looking for a Security Council resolution
                                merely to meet a situation in the Council itself. I told him we
                                thought it would be unfortunate to force a resolidification of Dutch
                                public opinion on Indonesia just when divergencies were beginning to
                                appear. I reminded him that we did not wish to carry the banner and
                                make ourselves solely responsible for whatever action was taken. I
                                said we realized that we could not draw back from our present
                                position but that we believe he should act on the basis of general
                                agreement among at least seven members of the Security Council both
                                as to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the content of any resolution which
                                might be introduced and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the timing of
                                such a resolution with particular reference to the situation in
                                Indonesia and Dutch public opinion. I emphasized the importance of
                                the attitude of the United Kingdom, stressed that their
                                participation was essential in any further action, and pointed out
                                that the United Kingdom might be able to move the Dutch closer to
                                the general point of view of the Security Council. Finally, I told
                                him that we were not pressing here for a Security Council resolution
                                at this point and believed that there was considerable merit in
                                deferring an actual resolution.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Jessup said that he was talking during the day with China,
                                Norway, Cuba, Canada, the United Kingdom and Egypt. In view of my
                                remarks he said that he would discuss with each of them not only the
                                content of the resolution but the question of timing, and would
                                specifically raise with General McNaughton the possibility of
                                postponing the meeting now set for Wednesday. He asked, if there
                                should be common agreement among seven members of the Council both
                                as to the content of the resolution and as to its being introduced
                                on Wednesday, whether he was authorized to proceed on a jointly
                                sponsored resolution. I told him I would wish to confirm that point
                                with Messrs. Hickerson and Butterworth.</p>
                            <p>After checking again with Messrs. Hickerson and Butterworth I
                                informed Dr. Jessup that, with some reluctance, we were prepared to
                                go ahead with a resolution commonly agreed among seven both as to
                                content and timing but that he should not seek such action as our
                                main <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0183"/>objective. I passed on
                                to him the information received from Mr. Hickerson that the French
                                Embassy has informed us that France would veto the resolution and
                                urged Dr. Jessup to discuss the resolution with the French
                                Delegation to determine what points were objectionable and whether
                                these points could be resolved by negotiation. I asked him to
                                consider with his colleagues on the Security Council the question of
                                pressing the resolution to the point of a French veto since there
                                was considerable reservation on that matter in the Department. I
                                again emphasized the importance we attach to the attitude of the
                                United Kingdom.</p>

                                developments after Mr. Rusk’s conversation with Dr. Jessup. He said
                                they had a meeting with Norway and China and had gone over the
                                resolution in detail agreeing on certain drafting changes. The
                                principal change was to provide that the Commission in making its
                                recommendations should take into account the economic well-being of
                                the population of Indonesia. In general, Mr. Scott said that
                                drafting changes were such as to be more palatable to the French
                                point of view and to the Dutch.</p>
                            <p>Scott reported that they plan to talk to the Cubans this afternoon to
                                go over the resolution and have a meeting set up with the United
                                Kingdom and Canada jointly. Thereafter if there was time today, or
                                if not, early tomorrow morning they were going to go over the
                                resolution with the Egyptian.</p>

                                about the working paper. He told deBeus that we were interested in
                                knowing exactly what parts of the resolution the Dutch objected to
                                and pointed out that we were proceeding on a basis whereby we had
                                not introduced a resolution in the Council, but were using the
                                device of a working paper in order to get the suggestions of the
                                Council members and of the Dutch. Scott said that apparently deBeus
                                reported this conversation to Helb in Washington because a little
                                later Helb called him from Washington and said that he would like to
                                come to New <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0184"/>York to discuss
                                the working paper with him. Scott suggested that this might mean
                                that the Dutch point of view was changing slightly and becoming less
                                intransigent.</p>
                            <p>Scott reported that pursuant to Rusk’s conversation with Jessup they
                                were going to talk to McNaughton about the possibility of postponing
                                Wednesday’s meeting. He said that there was a good chance of this
                                although China had indicated that they did not believe that the
                                meeting should be postponed beyond Thursday because of the
                                conference in New Delhi.</p>

                            <p>Spaak said he himself could not reconcile withdrawal of Dutch troops

                            <p>As for <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, Spaak stated flatly once
                                more that he thought it a body which had lost credit and was not
                                susceptible of rejuvenation with any hope real accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>He gave me these views and asked to be informed if I were furnished
                                any details our impending line approach this thorny problem. He
                                readily agreed Dutch military authorities had committed very stupid
                                blunder in their treatment Republic leaders. While Spaak knows our
                                general attitude vis-à-vis Dutch procedures, this particular brief
                                meeting was not occasion for me to elaborate to him personally and

                            <p>62. Canadian and British Delegations agree to text of draft working
                                paper contained mytel 59, January 18, and will recommend to their
                                governments that they should support and vote for this resolution.
                                We are hopeful that governments will support. McNaughton urged that
                                sponsorship by seven members would appear to be ganging up.</p>
                            <p>Fawzi, Egypt, has agreed to support this resolution subject to
                                contrary instructions from his government and is prepared to make
                                final commitment to this effect by Wednesday evening. He is doubtful
                                re sponsorship since he wishes to be free to “speak in favor of
                                stronger resolution and possibly to support stronger amendments.” If
                                these amendments not passed, he would support our resolution.</p>
                            <p>In agreement with Canadian and British Delegations, we gave text to
                                French Delegation on confidential basis not to be passed on to

                                support of seven members of Council. We expressed hope that changes
                                we had made since previous draft would make this resolution more
                                acceptable to them and enable them to abstain.</p>

                            <p>Changes made in working paper were then explained in detail. Parodi
                                said the new text was a great improvement and represented a major
                                effort to meet divergent views to which Jessup referred. With
                                reference to possibility of French veto, Parodi said that on basis
                                of this draft he would telegraph Paris recommending that they merely
                                abstain. He said he could not promise that they would not veto but
                                he <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0190"/>thought he would be
                                authorized to abstain. The abstention would be based on their
                                jurisdictional argument which Parodi still considers entirely sound.
                                Responding to Jessup’s suggestion that further proceedings in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should be in calm negotiating
                                atmosphere without recriminations and with further reference to
                                ultimate solution of problem, Parodi agreed to endeavor to persuade
                                Netherlands representatives to take an accommodating attitude. He
                                remarked that their military action in Indonesia was brutal and
                                unwise, and felt that some of their Army and colonial personnel had
                                acted badly. He indicated general agreement with Jessup’s over-all
                                estimate of situation and necessity of finding way out in the light
                                of common interests. Jessup said that he would in turn try to
                                persuade Palar and Rau to take a moderate attitude in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Parodi inquired whether any
                                amendments might be accepted in course of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> discussions and was told <gloss target="#t_USUN1"

                                votes would be forced before opportunity was afforded for

                                i.e. Neth Govt and Repub of Indonesia; (3) Establishment by means of

                            <p>It is position of US that, if above requirements are to be met, one
                                party to dispute, namely Repub of Indonesia, cannot be considered as
                                having been obliterated by Neth mil action. This does not mean that
                                US considers it feasible in present circumstances to reconstitute
                                Repub in sense <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi>, but rather
                                that, for brief period pending establishment by negotiation of

                                resolution, if adopted, in Asiatic eyes, meant “finis” for Holland
                                in Indonesia, and of western prestige, influence and, largely, of
                                western interests in that part of the world. Its consequence,
                                inevitably, would be the long term impoverishment of Holland, and
                                the almost certain growth of Communism here, as in France and Italy,
                                into a force that threatened its democratic existence. If Holland
                                was forced to take that road, the Dutch people would do so rather
                                than submit to what they would regard as gravest injustice.</p>
                            <p>Stikker was reminded that Netherlands Government had taken its course
                                in Indonesia after fullest and frankest friendly warning of the
                                danger involved. It was also pointed out to him that Netherlands
                                Government had indicated when it took military action Indonesia that
                                it sought only to remove those forces in the Republic which were
                                responsible for chaos and terror and which had restrained its
                                government from coming to agreement with the Netherlands
                                authorities, but that now it appeared that Netherlands had much more
                                far reaching objectives and really sought to root out the Republic
                                once and for all. His reply was that, notwithstanding opposition of
                                some prominent individuals and certain parties, it was still the
                                firm intention of Netherlands Government to deal with “prominent
                                leaders” of the Republican regime, as had been agreed with the
                                federalists and publicly announced. Their intentions, however they
                                claim, were being completely crossed up by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>; Lovink pleaded for postponement of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on resolution for long enough to
                                permit working out of text Netherlands could comply with or progress
                                to be made on negotiations currently going on in Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>Much of above has already been reported to Department and is repeated
                                now only as showing thinking of Foreign Office has undergone little
                                if any change by important and conciliatory revisions in original
                                Jessup resolution which we believe should have gone long way to meet
                                Dutch point of view. English colleague, however, who also received
                                copy Dutch proposed resolution does not see eye to eye with us
                                entirely.</p>

                            <p>58. In conversations with Lovink this morning, following indication
                                Foreign Office was in receipt revised draft <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution (as set out <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                    >Deptel</gloss> 43, January 18<note n="1" xml:id="d135fn1">See
                                    footnote 1, <ref target="#pg_163">p. 163</ref>.</note>)
                                considerable satisfaction was expressed to Embassy officer over
                                numerous revisions. Lovink said text, on first reading, seemed to be
                                “negotiable”, with one all-important exception, namely, the
                                provisions for restoration Republican Government. He said quite
                                frankly that Netherlands Government could not accept any arrangement
                                that meant or would be generally interpreted in Indonesia to signify
                                the return of the “old Republican gang” to power. That regime was
                                one frankly based upon control by military force, and meant fear,
                                intimidation, corruption and abuse to millions of Indonesians, both
                                outside and within Republic areas. It was a Javanese regime, whose
                                aims, as every informed person knew, were to play the dominating
                                role in all Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>If that regime were to be installed once again, said Lovink, it would
                                mean not only slap in the face of the Dutch, but the trooping back
                                of all those who had played role in it before, and result in a
                                virtual paralysis of any effort to establish democratic system in
                                Indonesia generally. In Dutch judgment, which was based upon
                                centuries in Indonesia, such step would be almost guarantee of
                                future strife in Indonesia among its various constituent parts, and
                                outright jeopardy of the law and order, peaceful economic recovery,
                                and democratic development which Indonesia sorely needs, and which
                                it is Dutch intent to assist to best of its ability.</p>
                            <p>Lovink said it was completely false to think that Republican
                                Government as such had any claim to merit or consideration as
                                governing body. Dutch had found on occupation that civil
                                administration was either completely lacking, or corrupt or woefully
                                weak. As symbol, it was force for chaos and not for order,
                                reconstruction and peace. A new government, based on best elements
                                of Republic, plus other well known figures, in their judgment, would
                                find ready acceptance by people of Republic area and the cooperation
                                of federalist areas, which, in Dutch opinion, were being almost
                                completely disregarded in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                thinking.</p>
                            <p>Lovink indicated Dutch are seeking to secure the agreement of a group
                                consisting of Hatta, Sjahrir, Leimena, Darmasetiawan, and one or two
                                others, to undertake the task of working out basis for bringing the
                                former Republican areas into the interim federal government.</p>

                                report dated January 16 and requested prompt action. At time of

                                    >GOC</gloss> discusison, suggested orally to <gloss

                                of course of Federal plan re visit tomorrow. Riphagen (Schuurman is
                                ill) explained might not be time to make necessary arrangements.
                                Pointed out to him only motor transport Medan to Prapat and return
                                would be required. Riphagen confirmed Palar message to Sukarno and
                                Hatta transmitted expeditiously by telegraph yesterday (<gloss
                                    target="#t_Gocus1">Gocus</gloss> 554). Stated Hatta and other
                                Bangka exiles now have freedom of island and that auto is assigned
                                them.</p>
                            <p>At 1730 Riphagen called to give answers. Promised confirmatory
                                letters later tonight. He explained Federal Assembly committee going
                                Prapat tomorrow by special plane. They hope induce Sukarno to
                                accompany <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0199"/>them immediately
                                to Bangka and there help induce Hatta to join all of them in return
                                trip Batavia. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> states
                                three <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> members perfectly
                                free to go along in special plane. USRep asked whether <gloss
                                    target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> could go Prapat or Bangka
                                subsequent day if unwilling accompany Federals. Riphagen replied
                                that this last opportunity, that thereafter <gloss
                                    target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> would have to make all
                                arrangements themselves. Asked me transmit this message to <gloss
                                    target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> immediately as arrangements
                                require speedy completion.</p>
                            <p>As to request of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, <gloss
                                    target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> would appreciate it if
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> went Prapat at later time.
                                USRep asked whether <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> could go
                                tomorrow anyway if it insisted, stating this unlikely. He stated no,
                                impossible get reply in time from Medan as to necessary
                                arrangements. Moreover, said frankly <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                    >GOC</gloss> would interfere with consultations that are to go
                                on. Emphasized only Indonesians will go tomorrow, that problem is
                                one for Federal Assembly with which Netherlands does not interfere.

                                hope Sukarno and Hatta will return with Federalists to Batavia
                                probably Saturday. Stated all this given me subject request “not for
                                publication,” as it will be embarrassing if exiles do not agree to
                                come Batavia. USRep stated he would give no information directly to
                                press and would ask colleagues not to do so. Gave him to understand
                                however that this will probably become part of <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> report which will be released in

                                wishes. Conditions Batavia such that <gloss target="#t_USDel1"

                            <p>Sudjono and Supomo arrived 1815. Gave them <gloss
                                    target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> answer. They decided it
                                essential that they and Darmasetiawan go along tomorrow in Federal
                                plane as it is important that before Sukarno responds to Federal
                                overtures he be fully informed as to current situation. They will
                                insist at Prapat on seeing Sukarno before he talks with Federals.
                                They fear that their going in company press [apparent omission].
                                They asked that <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> issue press
                                statement tomorrow morning explaining reason for their trip.
                                Explained this impossible for many reasons. It was decided they
                                would write letter to <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> explaining
                                their position. This can foe made subject of later public release
                                either by <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> report to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or their own volition. They will call
                                later tonight and prepare this letter after official Netherlands

                            <p>Army information service informed all American correspondents (also

                                your government that I am most unhappy about Indonesian situation
                                and apprehensive that your policy may in the long run help only the
                                Communists. I know only too well”, he said, “that the Dutch have
                                been stupid, but facing facts and having in mind our situation in
                                Indochina I hope your people will not be too severe with them.”</p>
                            <p>I told Shuman that I would transmit his message but at the same time
                                I took occasion again to emphasize our views on the question.</p>

                                expressed personal opinion that latter would not be in agreement

                            <p>Today Spaak informed Embassy that at same time we requested him use
                                his influence with Netherlands, Dutch Ambassador had made similar
                                request for him use his influence with US. He said he would do his
                                best carry out both requests. He could not, however, bring himself
                                support our draft resolution and he thought proposed United Nations
                                commission supervision in Indonesia would prove to have too
                                complicated task and if constituted was in all probability doomed to
                                be unsuccessful.</p>
                            <p>He had recommended to Dutch that they at once have some country
                                possibly France propose resolution sense which would be to (<hi

                                require transfer sovereignty to federal government in 1950. He
                                thought it might even be possible set date, say July 1, 1950.</p>
                            <p>Spaak thought Dutch plan stand aside and let Sharir<note n="2"

                                negotiate with representatives other members proposed federation was
                                big step forward. If these negotiations were successfully concluded
                                in 15 days and if Dutch would then give United Nations above
                                assurances, he inquired whether this would not actually accomplish
                                what we were all endeavouring achieve? He said he had strongly
                                counselled Dutch against taking any violent position vis-à-vis
                                United Nations, though he did not so state, he presumably referred
                                Stikker’s statement regarding possibility Dutch withdrawal from

                            <p>1. Committee refers to its telegram 21 January addressed to president
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> reporting that committee had
                                received request from Prime Minister Hatta to arrange facilities for
                                Republican mission to Lake Success in accordance with procedure
                                outlined at <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting 17 January.
                                Committee presented request to Netherlands Delegation 21 January so
                                that necessary clearances could be authorized. Committee was that
                                time informed that question authorizing mission had been referred to
                                Netherlands Government Hague. Committee has been informed that no
                                decision has been reached by Netherlands Government regarding
                                clearances and facilities for Republican representatives to proceed
                                Lake Success. Therefore, Committee is not in position to make any

                            <p>3. At 2100 hours, 24 January Committee delivered this letter to
                                Netherlands Delegation. Committee’s covering letter stated that copy
                                of Republican delegation’s letter 24 January would be forwarded to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and requested that any

                                Committee before 1100 hours 25 January.</p>
                            <p>4. At 1930 January 24 Committee received from Netherlands delegation
                                letter dated 24 January transmitting telegram from Prime Minister
                                Hatta quoted in paragraph 4 of Republican delegation letter 24
                                January. In addition, Netherlands delegation letter continued ‘in
                                this connection I have been authorized to state that neither
                                Netherlands Government nor Government Indonesia has either
                                officially or unofficially stated its position regarding visit of
                                Republican leaders to New Delhi Conference’. Netherlands letter did
                                not state date <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0208"/>on which
                                telegram thus transmitted from Prime Minister Hatta had been filed,

                            <p>5. Committee notes that ‘<gloss target="#t_PCJ1">PCJ</gloss>’ in
                                Prime Minister’s telegram is call-sign of Netherlands station at
                                Hilversum. Presumably, broadcast to which Prime Minister Hatta
                                refers related to news item which appeared in English edition Aneta
                                20 January as follows: ‘Replying to a question, spokesman said
                                Netherlands Government will not place any obstacle in their way
                                should one of Republican leaders wish to travel to Lake Success or
                                to New Delhi.’ Committee has subsequently ascertained from the
                                ‘spokesman’ referred to that he was not at time speaking officially
                                under instructions from his government.</p>
                            <p>6. On 25 January, Committee received following letter same date from

                                    >Gocus</gloss> 564).</p>
                            <p>7. At 1215 January 25 chairman of Committee informed representative
                                of acting chairman Netherlands delegation that in light final
                                paragraph of latter’s letter 25 January Committee would be glad to
                                receive any further comments that Netherlands delegation might have
                                ready up to 1530 hours of same day. No further comments have been
                                received.</p>

                                discussing draft resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">For text of
                                    resolution, as amended, adopted by the Security Council on

                                spirit stated expressly <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0209"
                                />that he was sure some parts of draft resolution could definitely
                                not be carried out. He has not yet received final instructions and
                                hopes he will not be instructed to state to <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> tomorrow that his government finds draft resolution
                                “unacceptable”. He seemed to anticipate instructions permitting a
                                moderate statement. He definitely believes restoration of Republic
                                Government to Jogja as required by paragraph 2 would be possible of
                                acceptance since it would likely undo results of Dutch action and
                                destroy their whole plan for establishing <gloss target="#t_USI1"
                                    >USI</gloss>. He stressed feeling in Netherlands that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is operating with complete distrust
                                of Netherlands and imposing a guardianship over its operations in
                                Indonesia and restricting its sovereignty there. These subjective
                                considerations are in his opinion of major importance. On details he
                                still considered very important the modification of paragraph 4(F)
                                particularly concerning recommendations relative to elections in
                                areas outside Republic but admitted it was unlikely they could get
                                any member of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to sponsor such an
                                amendment. He does not accept the objection that change in this
                                provision now would suggest Dutch unwillingness to allow fair
                                conditions for elections in non-Republican territories. The general
                                impression created by talk was that Netherlands is likely to make
                                moderate statement and in practice to accept Republic as party to
                                negotiations but not to carry out provisions regarding restoration
                                of the government to Jogja. Possibilities and advantages of
                                cooperative policy were strongly urged on him. Emphasis was laid on
                                possible fruits of a cooperative attitude on Netherlands side which
                                could be reciprocated by UN Commission in sincere effort to make
                                plan envisaged by draft resolution work.</p>

                            <p>90. At request Foreign Office called on Stikker and received
                                following information:</p>
                            <p>Yesterday immediately prior to Cabinet meeting to discuss and
                                formulate answer to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution,
                                Beel called from Batavia and outlined plan for immediate solution of
                                Indonesian questions, which they found necessary to keep secret for
                                present, which Beel and the Cabinet agreed offered an excellent
                                chance of complete success to achieve objectives of resolution
                                without delay and sooner than contemplated in resolution. Beel
                                stated he had discussed plan with Federalists and it was acceptable
                                to them and they had in turn consulted available leaders of Repub
                                who had found great merit in suggested approach and had consented to
                                going with Federalist leaders to Bangka for joint meeting to be held
                                today which Beel would probably be invited to attend.</p>
                            <p>Stikker expressed great optimism on this plan which had been
                                presented to Cabinet and met with their approval. He did not feel at
                                liberty to disclose any details of plan. I asked him if it was in
                                any way reflection of our Canadian colleague’s suggestion and he
                                said it was in no way connected with this. He further stated that
                                Critchley had already approached Dutch authorities and wished to
                                know what they were going to do about resolution. He said Herremans
                                had been consulted and was agreeable to allow reasonable length of
                                time for Dutch response to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution and that matter now rested in hands of Lisle who had
                                expressed no opinion as far as Beel was aware.</p>
                            <p>Stikker said that object of his asking me to visit him was to have me
                                request our government to do whatever was possible to grant Dutch
                                Government at least two or three days delay in making reply to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution because of his
                                belief that satisfactory solution might be found in Beel’s
                                suggestion for meeting convened for today on Bangka and requested
                                that I urgently communicate this to Department. He said instructions
                                had been sent to Van Kleffens in similar vein and that Van Royen had
                                been instructed in premises.</p>

                                rep Neth Emb Wash that Neth Govt intends shortly to deliver to you

                                UN Comm.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, principal reason why this Govt reposes hope in
                                success of settlement of Indonesian affair along lines of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss>
                                of Jan 28 is influence which Cochran has with Soekarno, Hatta and
                                other Repub leaders. Conversely, principal factor in our judgment
                                militating against chance of success of settlement along lines

                                <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss> is influence of certain high

                                Beel and Spoor. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> would take
                                extremely serious view of any formal request from Neth Govt that

                                work, not only because of implication involved in any such request,
                                but more importantly because of effect of Cochran’s removal upon
                                chances of long-term solution in Indonesia.</p>

                                of the resolution of 28th January, it is the opinion of His
                                Majesty’s Government that the following considerations will have to
                                be borne in mind.</p>
                            <list>

                                <item>So far as the Dutch are concerned, there is the danger that
                                    the Security Council may seek to impose a policy which the Dutch
                                    cannot implement and which may force them into flouting the
                                    authority of the Security Council. This may lead to the
                                    imposition of sanctions by the Security Council, whereupon the
                                    Netherlands might withdraw from the United Nations. Any such
                                    development would be bound to weaken the position of the
                                    Netherlands in the Western Union and to that extent would weaken
                                    Western Union itself. In Indonesia it will do no good to
                                    undermine the authority of the existing sovereign power at a
                                    time when an Indonesian Government is in no way ready to take
                                    overpower.</item>

                                <item>So far as the Indonesians are concerned, there is the danger
                                    that they will focus their attention exclusively on getting rid
                                    of the Dutch and devote too little attention to preparations for
                                    the transfer of power by he Dutch. There is also a danger that
                                    the Security Council’s Commission on Indonesia will intervene to
                                    such an extent in the negotiations that the Indonesians may
                                    leave matters too much in the hands of United Nations agents and
                                    not face up to their responsibilities in regard to a common
                                    policy agreed among themselves, and in regard to control of
                                    Indonesian forces. The result may be that, when <pb n="199"

                                    there will be a state of disorder in the country, a general
                                    breakdown in the machinery of Government through weakness and
                                    inexperience, and that the Independent State of Indonesia will
                                    emerge as another centre of instability in the Far East rather
                                    than, as we hope, a peaceful, orderly and democratic member of
                                    the Asiatic anti-Communist group. If the transfer of power is
                                    not planned with care, and if the Indonesians do not now begin
                                    to look to the future as well as the present, such a situation
                                    is almost certain to arise.</item>

                                <item>The magnitude of the task in Indonesia is such that no agency
                                    of the United Nations can hope to bring about a satisfactory
                                    solution by its own efforts alone. As in other cases which have
                                    come before the Security Council, a successful outcome is only
                                    possible if both parties to the dispute can be induced
                                    themselves to make a real effort to achieve it. In Indonesia, it
                                    is the Indonesians who from now on have got to do the spadework,
                                    if they are to be in a position adequately to perform the full
                                    functions of Government by 1st July, 1950, when the transfer of
                                    power is due to take place in accordance with the Security
                                    Council resolution. For the Dutch, their duty lies in
                                    facilitating the progress towards self-Government and not
                                    interfering with the process.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The first step is to be the creation of a Federal Interim
                                    Government by 15th March, 1949. In order to do this, it will be
                                    necessary for the Federalists and the Republicans to come to an
                                    agreement on the composition of such a Government, and they
                                    should be urged to get on with this. When the Federal Interim
                                    Government has been set up, it is to be hoped that it will have
                                    sufficient influence to put a stop to guerilla warfare and
                                    sabotage, which can only increase the existing chaos in the
                                    country. The cessation of these activities should render it
                                    possible for the cease-fire to become a reality instead of a
                                    farce as it is at present.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Not until the cease-fire has become really operative and the
                                    authority of the Federal Interim Government is established will
                                    it be possible to proceed seriously to the next step, which is
                                    the holding of elections throughout Indonesia by 1st October. In
                                    view of the necessity of preparing electoral rolls, it will be
                                    by no means easy to complete the procedure by the due date. In
                                    addition to this task, the Federal Interim Government will have
                                    to create a police force and to build up the Federal armed
                                    forces of Indonesia against the transfer of power. The example
                                    of Burma makes it clear that private armies must be abolished
                                    and that the only forces in existence at the transfer of power
                                    apart from the Dutch forces (which should then finally withdraw)
                                    should be the Federal Indonesian forces under the direct control
                                    of the Central Government.</item>

                                <item>After the elections have been held, it will presumably be

                                    general supervision over these developments in so vast an area.
                                    It can smooth over difficulties and iron out disputes but it
                                    cannot govern. It can urge upon the Dutch the relinquishment of
                                    authority in this or that sphere when it is clear that the
                                    Indonesians are capable of taking over. But it should be careful
                                    not to undermine Dutch authority before the Indonesians are
                                    ready to assume a given responsibility, since no authority at
                                    all will result in chaos. The principle must surely be that one
                                    administration must be in effective control, until another
                                    administration is in a position to assume that control. The fact
                                    that definite dates have been set for the various stages leading
                                    to the transfer of power should safeguard the Indonesians from
                                    any danger that the Dutch will deliberately delay the hand-over,
                                    always provided that the United Nations agency holds a watching
                                    brief. There is a greater danger that the Indonesians will not
                                    bestir themselves sufficiently to be ready to take over
                                    efficiently when the time comes.</item>

                                                brought opinion that Netherlands will accept

                                Dutch implementation of the Security Council’s resolution of January
                                28 so as not to hinder in any way the Dutch carrying out the plan
                                that they claim to have for reaching a solution of the Indonesian
                                problem. He said that his government is greatly concerned as regards
                                this matter and feels strongly that the Dutch should be given every
                                reasonable opportunity to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the
                                Indonesian problem.</p>

                                in Indonesia which would represent the free will of the parties to
                                the dispute, particularly if such agreement is generally consonant
                                with the Security Council’s resolution and prior agreements between
                                the parties. As regards the Dutch “plan” I said that we had heard of
                                Dutch intentions along this line but had received no details and I
                                could therefore make no comment save to point out that any agreement
                                which did not include responsible and representative Republican
                                leaders would not, in my opinion, be a desirable one nor an

                                steps which would prevent the functioning of any method of attaining
                                a solution of the Indonesian problem, save where his
                                responsibilities as such a representative required him to take
                                action, such as reporting to the Security Council.</p>

                            <p>108. <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 94, February 3. We
                                have left no possible shred of doubt in our statement to Foreign
                                Office of deadly earnestness of our Government and the serious view
                                we take re situation in Indonesia and the full intention our
                                Government to do everything necessary to push home objectives and
                                meaning of resolution we sponsored in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>. Stikker, Lovink and members of Cabinet can have no
                                illusion that US is speaking with its tongue in its cheek. My
                                conversation with Stikker did not fail to impress him with fact US
                                is most insistent that the definite steps this resolution entails
                                must be promptly and fully complied with. Undoubtedly Cochran’s
                                visit here and the meetings which are being scheduled for him will
                                further underline my statement of Department’s position anent
                                resolution and <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>’s duties in
                                Batavia, especially in view of fact that emphasis was laid by me on

                                summarize delegation reactions here to <hi rend="italic">New York
                                    Times</hi> story February 3, dateline Hague and our denial of

                                Cadogan, we are taking line that Dutch should have reasonable time
                                but that time must be used to arrange compliance with <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and not circumvention of
                                it. At same time we have made clear to all that US supports <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution January 28 which it
                                sponsored and has not changed its position.</p>
                            <p>Anticipate strong pressure for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                meeting sometime next week if <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>
                                does not report cooperative Dutch attitude in Indonesia. In dealing
                                with other delegates here <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> will
                                continue emphasize that US is committed to the principles contained
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. In my <pb n="207"
                                    xml:id="pg_207" facs="0221"/>opinion, US has secured important
                                advantage in terms of relations with Asiatic and Near Eastern states
                                through its position on this case in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>. Despite the many unfavorable press reactions
                                believe also this action by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> over a
                                peroid of time will have influence in strengthening UN and general
                                US policy of support for UN. On other hand, any weakening of our
                                position in support of action taken by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> would be highly injurious to UN, to our position in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and to our relations with
                                other delegations. Wish to emphasize specially our relations with
                                Canadian delegation which is continually most helpful to us in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. They extricated themselves
                                from hampering Ottawa instructions to maintain support pledged to
                                our joint resolution. Continued frank discussion and cooperation
                                with them is highly important. Re such delegations as Australia,
                                India and Philippines, they are supporting us now but would be quick
                                to attack if they get impression that we are weakening.</p>
                            <p>We have throughout been conscious of difficulties of situation in
                                terms North Atlantic Pact and other Western European problems. These
                                difficulties were of course fully appreciated by Department in
                                authorizing <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> to initiate <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action. Recognize that question of
                                possible pressure for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> sanctions
                                resolution would present added difficulties. Consider it practically
                                certain France would veto such a resolution but question of US stand
                                in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debates if such issue arises
                                may need to be faced. Final Van Roijen statement in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and Van Roijen’s attitude in last few
                                days of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration strongly
                                indicated readiness of Dutch to cooperate which attitude probably
                                reflects Dutch Labor Party dissatisfaction with Dutch military
                                action. Am convinced hope of solution and avoidance of further
                                complications can be secured only through continued support of
                                resolution and steady maintenance of pressure on Dutch through
                                diplomatic channels including every effort to persuade UK, France,
                                Belgium, Canada to make continuous parallel representations. Believe
                                further all these governments fully recognize both sides of picture
                                and fundamental US position of basic friendliness to Dutch and basic
                                disagreement with their recent Indonesian policy. UK, Canada, US
                                have by supporting <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution
                                jointly taken stand that implementing program in that resolution is
                                only way for Dutch to get out of dangerous situation they created
                                for themselves. If any modification this view seems necessary as
                                situation develops, believe <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>
                                should have opportunity in advance frankly to discuss with Cadogan,

                                Palar stressed futility Netherlands trying get agreement unless all
                                Republican leaders freely participate negotiations. Gave names
                                military leaders who would be useful calling off guerrillas. I
                                argued need for Sjahrir and Leimena in Batavia and opposed

                                embarrassment as result Netherlands handling Indonesia. He thought
                                Netherlands would go ahead their own way giving sovereignty
                                Indonesia but that our difficulty might come from Republican
                                intransigence and desire let <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> fight
                                their battle.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Kirk took me morning 6th see Spaak. I gave details
                                situation prior police action and reason my return US. Also
                                discussed <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution and US
                                seriousness regarding Netherlands compliance. Spaak doubted
                                Netherlands willingness include Soekarno and Hatta in Interim
                                Government preferring work with Sjahrir and questioned feasibility
                                restoration Republic. I argued need for broad cross section
                                Republican leaders for effective call to guerrillas lay down arms
                                and for participation in Interim Government if it to have confidence
                                support all Indonesians. Notwithstanding exceptions which might be
                                taken to individual leaders records I insisted these men have earned
                                their positions as champions of Nationalist movement and are heroes
                                to its followers. I thought folly attempt eliminate any these in
                                negotiations. On contrary said effort should be made bring in
                                Republican leaders scattered in Sumatra and outlying districts
                                Java.</p>
                            <p>Without taking initiative had opportunity suggest Spaak difficulty
                                would be experienced in having any agreement accepted by Republicans
                                and carried out with confidence so long as Beel and Spoor remain.
                                When Spaak asked regarding Van Mook,<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">Dr.
                                    Hubertus J. van Mook, former Lieutenant-Governor General of the
                                    Netherlands East Indies.</note> I said latter had been confused
                                at end his stay Indonesia and could not contribute progress if
                                returned. I thought Spoor’s chief of staff would be acceptable
                                commanding officer. Reviewing visits of Netherlands Ministers to
                                Indonesia, I praised Stikker’s efforts and said he was only one who
                                had gained confidence Republicans. I said agreement entirely
                                beneficial to Netherlands could have been achieved on Stikker’s
                                first visit had he <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0228"/>been
                                permitted remain few weeks longer and enjoy full support his
                                government. I thought best step would still be return Stikker to
                                Batavia for negotiations preferably with full power. Spaak
                                distressed over Netherlands situation and admitted lack quick
                                success in achieving complete military control in Indonesia
                                confirmed police action unwise. Spaak asked me call on return to
                                Brussels after visit Hague.</p>
                            <p>Arrived Hague February 6, 3 p. m. Visited Stikker alone 4 to 7 p. m.
                                He sought details of negotiations <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                    >GOC</gloss> and myself with Netherlands and Republican
                                officials immediately prior police action. I told him I reported I
                                could be of little assistance Batavia following such action and that
                                Department ordered me home for consultation. Said I had not
                                participated discussions Lake Success but had conferred in
                                Department with Jessup and visited him and Palar in New York on
                                departure and Spaak in Brussels. I said would follow entirely his
                                ideas as to whom I should see in Hague. We agreed on no information
                                to press during Hague stay other than I was paying respects while
                                returning my post.</p>
                            <p>Stikker reminded me how he endeavored prevent police action. He
                                genuinely aware serious international situation into which
                                Netherlands has come as result thereof. He insisted Netherlands
                                political situation makes impossible full acceptance <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution by present government. He
                                said government would fall if attempted take this entirely. I
                                analyzed resolution endeavoring ease his mind on certain points
                                which he exaggerated. I emphasized, however, there should be no
                                misunderstanding US loyalty to support this resolution. Stikker
                                thought we should all agree that achieving common objective is real
                                purpose irrespective methods. Said Republicans and Federalists
                                without Netherlands meeting that day in Bangka to see if they could
                                get together on ideas constitution and authority Interim Government
                                to be set up soonest. Anything negotiated successfully between
                                groups at Bangka would then have to be considered by Netherlands and
                                agreement sought. Setting up of Interim Government would be followed
                                by negotiations between Interim and Netherlands Governments on three
                                major points of finance and economic arrangements, military
                                agreement and union statutes. Idea is, however, to plan Interim
                                Government as simply as possible and have it last briefly perhaps
                                not more than two or three months with sovereignty thereafter turned
                                over to strictly Indonesian Government. Elections and constitutional
                                assembly would come thereafter. Stikker asked my ideas which I gave
                                frankly and are set forth later in this message.</p>
                            <p>Stikker admitted Netherlands in critical situation. Said might not be
                                able carry on military operations beyond another five or six months
                                because of cost thereof. Admitted guerrilla activity serious and
                                that <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0229"/>military mistakes had
                                been made particularly in occupation certain important cities such
                                as Madiun. He spoke unhappily of many incidents attributed to
                                Batavia authorities which have embarrassed Netherlands Government.
                                At same time he insisted Beel could not be fired. He said Schuurman
                                would be replaced on Netherlands Delegation possibly by Netherlands
                                Ambassador Lamping from New Delhi. He thought this wise in view
                                Lamping familiarity with Eastern question. (From other sources,
                                including Spaak, I learn Lamping stiff negotiator).</p>

                                    xml:id="d162fn4">Dr. Nico S. Blom and Dr. H. N. Boon were high
                                    officers in the Netherlands Foreign Office.</note> Blom went
                                over plan Stikker had described and also let me know there had been
                                alternative considered of having Interim Government to be arrived at
                                through Bangka conversations merely body to negotiate with
                                Netherlands for turning over sovereignty at later date. That is,
                                this group would not be given operational authority until it became
                                the government of planned “Republic of Federal or US of Indonesia”
                                which it was hoped could be created before July 1, 1949. I learned
                                from Blom that there was also some idea of not passing complete
                                sovereignty on that date but only conditional sovereignty leaving
                                period of perhaps one year to see how things went in Indonesia as to
                                law and order, etc. I posed certain questions on this plan as I had
                                to Stikker. Blom expressed surprise I hesitated fall in with idea
                                such early settlement of question. Boon urged I talk frankly with
                                Cabinet members on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution, he
                                pleading that Ministry Foreign Affairs understood my position
                                clearly and needed no argument to convince it what should be
                                done.</p>
                            <p>At instance Her Majesty Queen Juliana, drove to Soesdijk afternoon
                                February 7, had tea and visited with Her Majesty 1¼ hours. Her
                                Majesty expressed warm appreciation US assistance to Netherlands
                                during and since war. Recalled long established close ties and
                                friendship between our countries. Introducing discussion Indonesian
                                situation, revealed intimate knowledge events and personalities.</p>
                            <p>Asked my opinion Hatta and Sjahrir. I answered with respect
                                Republican leaders manner above described in talk with Spaak. Her
                                Majesty asked why I stood up for Republican leaders rather than
                                Federalist leaders who represented majority. I explained <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> terms of reference envisaged
                                extending Good Offices only between Netherlands and Republican,
                                Governments and that we purposely had reframed <pb n="216"

                                Federalist leaders. I made point, however, that I had suggested

                                authority for <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> contact and work
                                with Federalists as well as Republican and Netherlands leaders. I
                                said I had been well impressed by Federalist leaders whom I had seen
                                and realized entirely need for bringing two groups together and
                                consolidating their desires and efforts for achieving Nationalist
                                aims.</p>
                            <p>I assured Her Majesty that it should be possible under present

                                Her Majesty asked how we would handle “wild boys”. I said I favored
                                widest possible Federalist leadership in discussions and in setting
                                up Interim Government in order this can make effective appeal to
                                armed forces to lay down arms. Her Majesty was critical of position
                                Australia has taken in premises and of casting lot with Asiatic
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty asked specifically what should be done. We agreed Solomon
                                was required. Her Majesty said would like turn question over to him.
                                I hinted Her Majesty give me chance do something. I said fundamental
                                requirement is for Netherlands Government convince world it intends
                                accept and abide by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution to
                                fullest extent reasonably possible. I said I could not outline
                                complete plans before returning Batavia and consulting Republican
                                leaders whom I have not seen since before police action. I said
                                immediately necessary Netherlands Government follow <gloss

                                with Stikker, Drees and Sassen.<note n="5" xml:id="d162fn5">E. J. M.

                                will preserve beneficial interests of Netherlands in Indonesia. In
                                respect to Her Majesty’s inquiry, I said I might see Spaak on return
                                Brussels. Her Majesty expressed highest regard for his

                            <p>Dined Stikker’s night February 7 where other guests: Drees and
                                Sassen. Stikker asked me repeat for colleagues statement I made him
                                previous evening. I explained that upon return US, I had volunteered
                                step aside if Department found my work Indonesia unsatisfactory or
                                if of opinion someone else could serve more helpfully in future.
                                Department led me understand there might be another assignment in
                                view for me but that it desired I continue on present job until
                                finished. I recalled that it had envisaged my being last US
                                representative on <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0231"/>
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>. I said I had volunteered idea
                                returning Indonesia by Hague in order let my friends here see there
                                had been no bitterness whatever on my part although great
                                disappointment over our failure prevent police action. I stressed
                                American desire assist old friend and ally get out of present
                                difficult situation. I spared no details in picturing how bad their
                                predicament was and how much worse it might become unless
                                Netherlands Government implemented <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Resolution. I recalled I had sent personal wire Lisle few days ago
                                suggesting Netherlands Government would require some time to adjust
                                its operations to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution. I
                                emphasized, however, no intent to delay compliance therewith or for

                            <p>I explained resolution was not US measure but represented

                                tone of latter had been kept comparatively moderate only through
                                exceptionally skillful diplomacy on part of American Ambassador
                                Delhi. I said I found American public and Congressional opinion
                                keenly critical of Netherlands position and Department making great
                                efforts protect ally. I specifically mentioned hearings on <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid and expressed intentions of
                                certain Congressmen to question extension <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> aid to Netherlands if not assured such funds not
                                employed in supporting military action against Indonesia. I said
                                noncompliance by Netherlands now with <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> Resolution would give press and Congress added
                                reason for attack and for suggesting cutting off all funds. I
                                insisted I was speaking entirely personally and not bringing any
                                threat from my Department that <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                aid would be stopped. I was simply saying frankly as a friend that
                                whatever might be attitude of Department of State such danger would
                                be risked if behavior of Netherlands is such as to warrant <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> calling it before its tribunal again
                                on handling of Indonesian question. I reminded them that I had
                                sought influence Palar, and I thought successfully, not to endeavor
                                revive Indonesian debate unless real need develops after reasonable
                                period.</p>
                            <p>Regarding plan outlined to me by Stikker I expressed two fundamental
                                ideas (1) I was convinced neither <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                nor public would accept with full confidence any decisions reached
                                by Republicans and Federalists towards setting up Interim Government
                                if conversations take place while Republicans in custody Netherlands
                                Military Forces. I <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0232"
                                />expressed entire agreement with idea that two groups should be
                                brought together but reminded Ministers they had not yet complied
                                with original or repeated requests of S’C that Republican leaders be
                                liberated; (2) I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> is not permitted participate in present Indonesian
                                conversations and that as far as I had learned from my talks to date
                                with them there appeared no intention on their part permit <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> play any role in negotiations
                                toward setting up Interim Government. They responded that they,
                                themselves, were not represented in present conversations,
                                preferring give two groups privacy in settling their own problem. I
                                said Republicans have in past indicated preference having third
                                party, namely agency <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, present when
                                consummating agreement with Netherlands. I felt strongly Netherlands
                                should abide <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution and permit
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> assist immediately in any
                                conversations following Bangka meeting. I said this not only
                                required to meet <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> desires but
                                should also facilitate results.</p>
                            <p>Stikker stated I had presented <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and
                                Republican views. He and associates would present Hague and Batavia
                                side. He emphasized political difficulty for coalition Netherlands
                                Government accept detailed resolution adopted by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. While Netherlands Government had
                                indicated willingness set up Interim Government, have elections and
                                transfer sovereignty within certain periods, <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> apparently had not taken their word and insisted on
                                specific dates. Government had been embarrassed by constant flow of
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> reports. Furthermore,
                                Critchley had gone to <gloss target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss> Government
                                few hours after adoption <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>

                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> had continued harass government
                                with questions thereon. I said <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> had
                                adopted general date schedule offered by Netherlands and had gone
                                slightly further in making specific appreciating value of fixed date
                                to Indonesian psychological situation. While <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> Resolution calls for thorough reporting job, I was
                                confident <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would be reasonable
                                once Netherlands Government gives some sign inclination comply with
                                resolution.</p>
                            <p>Drees expressed unhappiness over extent to which he felt <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution interferes with
                                Netherlands sovereignty in Indonesia in political, military and
                                economic fields. He mentioned new provision in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution regarding <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> contacting Federalists. He said
                                various provisions give such extensive powers towards moving troops
                                and requiring economic aid for Republicans that Netherlands
                                Government must yield much authority while retaining heavy
                                responsibility. I said I had personally recommended inclusion
                                privilege <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> contacting
                                Federalists freely. Federalists endeavored come to me frequently
                                seeking ideas on eventual association with Republicans. After police
                                action, requests had increased. I felt <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> could be genuinely useful in <pb n="219"
                                    xml:id="pg_219" facs="0233"/>bringing these, leaders together
                                with Republicans and Netherlands. In economic field, I said
                                resolution calls for not much, if any, outlay beyond that which
                                Netherlands is probably making at present. I said idea was primarily
                                to make sure Republican leaders would be taken care of upon return
                                Jogja. Even now Netherlands Government has responsibility their
                                maintenance.</p>
                            <p>I told Drees that he exaggerated complications of resolution. Stikker
                                said I should frankly know, as I would be sure learn on returning
                                Batavia, that they are in serious difficulties and pan only carry on
                                with present schedule for few months. I said we had anticipated this

                                exactly opposite effect. First it had upset truly conservative
                                Republican Government which with own leaders and resources had
                                successfully put down Communist uprising few weeks earlier and had
                                demonstrated to world its faith in democracy. Degrading policy
                                pursued in taking Republican leaders into custody and continuing to
                                hold them inevitably weakens their influence on followers. It will
                                make more difficult any attempts influence guerrillas lay down arms
                                and threatens destruction conservative [nucleus] leaders which I
                                thought Netherlands Government considered as did my own best
                                available group about which an Interim Government and finally a
                                    <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> could be constituted.
                                Secondly, police action had set off resentment in all of Asia with
                                resultant New Delhi conference where only efforts of American
                                Ambassador had been able to restrain delegates from adopting almost
                                violent resolution. Netherlands action had thus given incentive to
                                first actual steps toward constituting Asiatic bloc which may
                                conceivably develop further and establish line of demarkation if not
                                opposition to Western group.</p>
                            <p>Stikker asked if I offered objection to changing head Netherlands
                                Delegation Schuurman and perhaps his assistants. I thought these men
                                were worn out from long stay on difficult task and perhaps better
                                results might be achieved by replacements. I had taken no initiative
                                on this point and assured group I had gotten on with Netherlands
                                Delegation personally although problems involved many tense
                                situations. I said I had no suggestions to make with respect other
                                officials at Batavia but assumed Netherlands Government must have
                                some worries thereover as result recent incidents.</p>
                            <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0234"/>
                            <p>I told group I hoped I had been able convince them need for
                                compliance with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution and for
                                immediate commencement implementation thereof through first steps of
                                releasing Republican civil leaders and permitting <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> function. I said that unless this
                                was envisaged there was no use my spending government money
                                returning to Batavia or <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>
                                endeavoring be of assistance. Drees assured me he had desired place
                                leaders at liberty but some Cabinet colleagues objected on fear some
                                Republicans might scatter to otherwise peaceful areas in Indonesia
                                and start trouble. I said such chance would have to be taken sooner
                                or later and that I personally thought there would be no danger
                                whatever from this source. I said it was much to interest these
                                leaders continue contacts now commenced with Federalists, be in
                                touch with <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> and consummate
                                negotiations for Interim Government. I added <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would, of course, use its
                                influence if such might be necessary to see that no untoward acts
                                taken by Republican leaders when once given complete freedom. Drees
                                said there might have to be some fixing of residence although there
                                would be no stipulation that Republicans must refrain from political
                                activities when liberated. He promised move in this direction
                                soonest. Group thought there should be no difficulty <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> having contact with Republican
                                leaders pointing out visits already permitted. I said not
                                satisfactory if <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> obliged
                                require permits to see Republicans and to travel various parts
                                Indonesia this purpose. I said I was not at all sure I could see fit
                                undertake exercising Good Offices with Republicans as long as I have
                                to ascertain visiting days from Schuurman and fly various localities
                                to find them and then talk with them under surveillance. Cabinet
                                officers promised remedy this situation and let me understand <gloss

                            <p>In our conversations, group mentioned idea bringing Interim
                                Government delegation to Hague after Provisional Government set up
                                to negotiate for <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> arrangements.
                                They said negotiations in Hague with Federalists had been much
                                easier than if held in Indonesia and thought results could be
                                achieved more satisfactorily in present case. I hoped that treatment
                                of Indonesians from now on be such that they would have faith in
                                undertakings Netherlands Government and would not fear their leaders
                                subject to duress if brought Hague for final arrangements. I argued
                                again as I had with Stikker that date of final transfer sovereignty
                                to <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> should be fixed and not
                                postponed or conditioned. When I left 11 p. m., group remained to
                                consider policy to be followed on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Resolution in Tuesday Cabinet meeting.</p>
                            <p>Spent entire forenoon 8th talking with Blom and Boon, Foreign Office.
                                They assured me I did not need convince Stikker or them of my
                                position or my genuine desire to help. They said great need was to
                                    <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0235"/>make Sassen and other
                                Cabinet Ministers comprehend serious international political
                                situation Indonesian problem has brought Netherlands. They asked
                                what I had accomplished “trio” previous evening. I summarized
                                conversations. We then went over <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Resolution, paragraph by paragraph, since they sought my explanation
                                thereof. I gave them my ideas but waived any responsibility for
                                interpretation emphasizing this could be done by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> alone. I stressed to them as I had to
                                Cabinet Ministers absolute necessity compliance with resolution and
                                endeavored disabuse their minds any intention of US helping them to
                                evade consequences of resolution. On other hand, I showed wherein I
                                thought they exaggerated implications of resolution and argued they
                                should depend on reasonableness of <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> in using discretion granted by resolution in
                                helping implementation once Netherlands begins cooperating. They
                                endeavored argue <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action had
                                thwarted Netherlands efforts settle Indonesian problem and was
                                endangering success military undertaking. I made point Netherlands
                                Government had not yet done anything <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> had requested arid latter surely could not be blamed
                                for any failure Netherlands Government suffered through measures
                                violating international undertaking. They said they meant Republican
                                intransigeance strengthened by knowledge <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> taking action. I reminded them Indonesian question
                                has been on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agenda long time and
                                both parties must expect <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> interest
                                continuing therein. Doubted guerrillas much influenced by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution. May not even know of it
                                since I just read report Republican leaders had not yet seen it. To
                                Foreign Office, as to Ministers, I gave our arguments that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> does not recognize that police action
                                has eliminated Republican as one party to dispute before it.</p>
                            <p>Told friends that when conferring with Ministers had inquired whether
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would be brought Hague for
                                negotiations here. They said this could be decided later. I had
                                reminded them that <hi rend="italic">Renville</hi> Agreements gave
                                either party privilege insist on continuation UN agency until actual
                                transfer sovereignty. Blom and Boon seemed much relieved by my
                                explanation certain points on resolution. They gave interesting
                                details confidentially on various communications exchanged with
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> when I was at Batavia and
                                placed blame for some of most unhelpful correspondence on officials
                                at Batavia. They insisted Stikker should be sent Batavia with full
                                powers to negotiate.</p>
                            <p>My friends sought my advice since they were preparing statements to
                                be used by Cabinet at Chamber session 9th when Indonesian question
                                would be debated and Ministers likely be questioned extent <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution would be followed. I said
                                I had not anticipated any reply to resolution beyond Van Royen’s
                                last speech. I suggested this speech be quoted by Ministers in
                                Chamber debate as indicating Netherlands <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222"
                                    facs="0236"/>official position. I said it would be most helpful
                                and I thought extremely wise if Ministers could follow up by stating
                                steps being taken to give Republican leaders same freedom enjoyed
                                Indonesia by any other civilians and that cooperation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> in negotiations towards setting
                                up Interim Government would be welcomed by Netherlands. I thought
                                that more positive statement could be made along lines showing
                                compliance with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution more
                                beneficial in effect.</p>
                            <p>I said there should be absolutely no reservations other than those
                                contained in Van Royen’s speech on willingness Netherlands
                                Government accept and comply with resolution. Friends inquired
                                regarding possibility US giving financial aid soonest if sovereignty
                                transferred. I pictured our dilemma if we try envisage with Congress
                                and financial agencies new funds for Indonesia while Netherlands
                                behavior is such that direct help to Indonesia is now suspended and
                                Congress faced with measure to stop any funds to Netherlands. All of
                                this comes at time <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> hearings on
                                new appropriations.</p>
                            <p>At noon brought Ambassador Baruch to date. Received Labor Party
                                leaders: Van der Goes Van Naters and Logmann in hotel room for half
                                hour their request. They recalled conversations with me at Hague
                                last July and discussed subsequent developments. They endeavored
                                justify military action although they said they had consistently
                                opposed it. I answered questions thereon and defended <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> positions. They said mistakes had undoubtedly been
                                made and they now desired know what I thought should be done toward
                                righting situation. They agreed entirely with my idea that
                                Republican leaders should be immediately liberated, <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> permitted to function, and no
                                defiance made of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution. They
                                asked I convey their greetings to Sjahrir and other Republican
                                leaders.</p>
                            <p>Motored Brussels afternoon 8th with Steere. Spaak received Ambassador
                                and me 6 p. m. I summarized conversations with Queen and Netherlands
                                officials. Emphasized extent Netherlands floundering in military and
                                financial difficulties but religious factions in coalition
                                government hesitating take broad view Indonesian problem and still
                                working as if local issue. I said Stikker understood situation and I
                                thought was one individual who had some chance negotiating agreement
                                with Indonesia. I said I had not presumed make suggestion to Queen
                                although had praised Stikker’s efforts at negotiation in Java to Her
                                Majesty. Likewise had felt should not as American representative

                            <p>After the conversation with the Secretary yesterday on the Atlantic
                                Pact, Sir Oliver Franks of the British Embassy handed Mr. Acheson
                                the attached memorandum on Indonesia<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">See

                                Indonesia. He said he would appreciate very much if Mr. Acheson
                                would have the State Department working people consider this
                                memorandum and later discuss it with Mr. Graves<note n="3"

                            <p>After we left the Secretary’s office, Sir Oliver spoke to me further
                                about this matter in the Secretary’s anteroom. He said he had not
                                wished to take up the Secretary’s time unnecessarily with this
                                matter but that the British Government was deeply disturbed over the
                                Indonesian situation, not only from the effects it might have in
                                Southeastern Asia where the U.K. has important interests, but also
                                because of the possibility that a deteriorating Indonesian situation
                                might so adversely affect the economy of the Netherlands that the
                                European Recovery Program might be endangered.</p>
                            <p>Sir Oliver said that the British Government has had a good deal of
                                experience in the transfer of power to colonial peoples; Burma,
                                India, Pakistan et cetera. The British Government has found that
                                there is always a lot of trouble and danger inherent in any such
                                situation. Sir Oliver went on to say that in these circumstances he
                                earnestly hoped that the United States would use its influence with
                                both the Dutch and the Indonesians to “get them around a table and
                                make them talk turkey”.</p>
                            <p>Sir Oliver said that when our working people were in a position <pb
                                    n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0239"/>to talk to Mr. Graves it
                                would be helpful if he could in due course be informed that the
                                views expressed by them on this subject are the ones of the
                                Secretary.</p>
                            <p>I told Sir Oliver that Mr. Butterworth and I, or Mr. Butterworth and
                                Mr. Thompson would after considering this statement get in touch
                                with Mr. Graves.</p>

                                to contain certain elements which might serve to break the present
                                apparent impasse in Indonesia. I said we had no great amount of
                                information regarding that plan and he then made available a summary
                                thereof. At the same time he communicated the texts of a number of
                                telegrams exchanged between the Foreign Office and The Hague in
                                which Mr. Bevin<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1">Ernest Bevin, British
                                    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> requested and
                                received clarification of a number of the points in the plan. From
                                this exchange it was noted that Mr. Bevin had expressed misgivings
                                as to the successful implementation of the plan.</p>
                            <p>In the ensuing discussion I mentioned my own doubts as to certain
                                points in the plan and it was evident that my doubts and Mr. Bevin’s
                                misgivings related to the same fundamental issues, namely it
                                appeared that the Indonesians were to have little choice in the
                                matter and that the transfer of sovereignty was to be made
                                contingent upon certain agreements and upon Dutch terms. I also
                                pointed out that the plan did not go to the crux of the situation,
                                which is how to bring about a cessation of hostilities, and that
                                this essential cessation could not be effected unless and until the
                                responsible Republican leaders were liberated and in a position to
                                order a cease fire by the guerrilla forces operating in Indonesia
                                and in a position to outlaw those who did not respond to this order.
                                Furthermore, unless and until the Dutch took steps to carry out at
                                least the initial requirements of the Security Council resolution I
                                did not see how negotiations of a serious and binding character
                                could be entered into, and without these there appeared to be little
                                chance of the plan ever becoming operative.</p>
                            <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0240"/>
                            <p>Mr. Graves asked whether or not the short cut to the establishment of
                                an interim government and eventual transfer of sovereignty, set
                                forth in the plan, did not have much to commend itself, But with so
                                much to be done, to conclude arrangements for the government, with
                                so many agreements (Netherlands–Indonesian union, economic and
                                financial matters, and defence) to be negotiated, I felt that the
                                two-month period mentioned in the plan was much too short. And as
                                regards those agreements I believed that the wording of the plan
                                envisaged transfer of sovereignty only after those agreements had
                                been finalized—and negotiations in regard thereto might drag on
                                interminably.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Graves mentioned that one telegram from the Foreign Office
                                contained Mr. Bevin’s desire to have our reaction to the “Beel
                                Plan”, particularly whether or not we would go along with it, and I
                                said that, despite any advantages the plan might offer, the United
                                States being a member of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>,
                                an agency of the Security Council, could not take an active position
                                vis-à-vis that or any plan in preference to the Security Council
                                resolution so long as <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> did
                                not recommend it, as it could do under the resolution. I said
                                further that the greatest disadvantage of the plan so far as I could
                                see was that it did not initiate any implementation of the
                                resolution, such as release of political prisoners, freedom to
                                negotiate, etc., and with [<hi rend="italic">without</hi>] such
                                implementation I doubted whether anything could be done with any
                                measure of success as regards solving the Indonesian problem. I
                                confessed that we were concerned that the lack of implementation
                                might lead to an unfavorable report by <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> on March 1 with the attendant danger of some
                                member of the Security Council bringing up the question of
                                sanctions.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Graves then mentioned the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                                <note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">See undated memorandum, <ref

                                Ambassador had left with the Secretary and we agreed that, as
                                regards the final recommendations (1) to press the Dutch to take
                                position with regard to the Security Council resolution and (2) to
                                press the Indonesians to put their house in order, the first would
                                have to take place before the second could be acted upon. In any
                                event I said that we were anxious to cooperate with the British in
                                any forward looking steps towards a solution.</p>

                                postponement. He differed sharply. I said I sincerely hoped we would
                                not have divided vote on first decision to be taken after my return.
                                I insisted, however, that developments were in process which I
                                thought might result much more helpfully to Indonesian cause than

                            <p>Visited Schuurman today. Summarized trip to US and Europe. Emphasized
                                US adherence complete <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution
                                and my desire be resonable and helpful as possible in achieving
                                early implementation thereof. He referred differences between The
                                Hague and Batavia. Said The Hague views problem from international
                                standpoint while Beel naturally concerned with Indonesian side. Said
                                Beel’s return Hague caused by resignation Sassen. Though there were
                                three possibilities namely: Beel convinced Hague correctness his
                                position or be convinced Hague’s position or compromise. He did not
                                rule out possibility Beel resigning. I said I understood Beel
                                desired Hague issue statement refusing accept <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution and Hatta desired Hague statement
                                accepting resolution. Said I suggested in Hague compromise idea of
                                issuing no statement but letting Van Royen’s last speech in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> suffice and proceeding with
                                implementation resolution.</p>
                            <p>Discussed with Schuurman possibility progress that might be made by
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> assisting in talks with
                                Republican[s] and Federalists. He said he had received no new
                                instructions and doubted any would be received from Hague pending
                                consultation there with Beel. Said Beel due Hague today and probably
                                returning Batavia end next week. Said approval given <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> visit Republicans tomorrow.
                                Saw no objection my receiving personally any Federalists who might
                                desire call. Feared resolution might stiffen Republicans unduly and
                                referred particularly statement attributed to. Hatta by Isaacs (re
                                Hague’s 153<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                            <p>Schuurman referred to short-cut plan for settlement but said it too
                                nebulous to give definite details. Said Beel would seek decision
                                thereon. Dicussions in Hague may naturally cause important changes.
                                Explaining I had only sketchy idea of plan, Schuurman volunteered
                                some information. Drees had told me plan was Beel’s. Schuurman said
                                original idea came up some time ago in East Indonesia and was later
                                discussed by some Federalists. Beel further developed it. General
                                idea is to set up interim government soonest and transfer
                                sovereignty in two or three <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0246"
                                />months. Within that period conference would probably be held Hague
                                for working out solution some major problems required before
                                sovereignty could be transferred. Schuurman thought <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> might participate therein.
                                Certain important issues would have to be settled by treaty or
                                otherwise after initial transfer sovereignty. Full and unconditional
                                transfer might not take place until twelve months after initial
                                    step.<note n="5" xml:id="d171fn5">For further details on the

                                information re plan to offer any observations except that world and
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would not take seriously any

                                and chance talk with Indonesians. I told Schuurman I had no
                                objection early transfer sovereignty provided this arrived at
                                through amicable negotiations without coercion or duress and
                                provided transfer takes place in circumstances which would offer new
                                government genuine chance succeed. Indonesian Government should not
                                be loaded down with inherited mess of financial, military and other
                                problems which would probably result in its failure. (I have felt
                                that such catastrophe may be expected and desired by die-hards.) I
                                said any Indonesian Government setup in most propitious
                                circumstances would surely face difficulties as have new governments
                                Latin-America and Philippines, Said Indonesian Government would have
                                to look to Netherlands for much cooperation and should be willing
                                assure Netherlands of continuing beneficial interest this area. I
                                thought outlook would be disappointing unless both parties now act
                                entirely in good faith and work out sound and enduring arrangement.
                                Thought time schedule fixed by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution ample and short-cut should be taken only if comparable

                            <p>Emphasized Schuurman [my] trip to Europe had been at own suggestion
                                and on my responsibility; my government expected early

                                in favor such plan. At same time <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss> pointed out there appeared be little hope making
                                plan operative until initial conditions of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss> were put into force, namely
                                releasing political prisoners and enabling them negot with both
                                Dutch and Federalists without stigma of negot under duress as would
                                naturally be inferred if they negotiated while in Dutch custody.
                                Also <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> pointed out two months
                                period to negot points (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) was short and plan
                                envisaged transfer of sovereignty only after final agreement was
                                reached on above points. Accordingly under best of circumstances
                                “Beel Plan” means conditional transfer sovereignty in indefinite
                                future whereas <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_res1">Res</gloss> fixes definite date for transfer
                                sovereignty. Moreover in <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s
                                judgment plan does not go to crux sit which is how being about
                                cessation of hostilities and <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>
                                does not believe such cessation can be effected unless responsible
                                    <gloss target="#t_Rep1">Rep</gloss> leaders are liberated and in
                                position authoritatively order cease fire by guerrilla forces now
                                operating in Indonesia and therefore outlaw those not

                                whether Indonesians like this or not; Bevin concludes nothing to
                                show Indonesians are to have any free choice in matter and Neth is
                                offering early transfer power on own terms and without regard
                                Indonesian point of view. He adds if above are not Dutch intentions
                                it is imperative they should make both their motives and their
                                intentions absolutely clear when they announce their policy.
                                Furthermore Bevin is increasingly perturbed at delay and appearance
                                Dutch are giving of ignoring <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_res1">Res</gloss> and he proposes Dutch make

                            <p>In <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>’s thinking Brit increasingly
                                concerned Neth Govt will fall, that without some such plan or

                            <p>Government had repeatedly declared it would continue to act toward
                                resolution in accordance Van Royen <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                statement. (He quoted resolution and Van Royen statement).
                                Netherlands’ policy including military action “had same aim as
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution, i.e., maintenance
                                of law and order. If good relations between parties are to be
                                gradually restored, care will have to be taken that their basis
                                internal quiet is maintained and not threatened anew. Break between
                                UN and Netherlands would only be possible—as to procedure—and then
                                only differences about procedure which is to be carried out in a
                                relatively short time.” He said that UN and Netherlands pursuing
                                same goal.</p>
                            <p>Referring first recommendation of resolution Netherlands confining
                                itself to “active defense” against murdering, plundering guerrilla
                                bands. If Republican leaders “want to show that they are prepared to
                                comply with first recommendation and cooperate with Netherlands for
                                restoration peace, law and order, an important act would have been
                                performed which could be built upon.” Federalists without abandoning
                                national aspirations have understood that quickest, surest, safest
                                way of attaining sovereign Indonesian regime is way of order and
                                consultation.</p>
                            <p>Netherlands prepared to offer Republican leaders a proper place in
                                federal interim government but they have so far shown no inclination
                                to enter such government. They prefer compliance with second
                                recommendation. “Anyone who considers this demand objectively will
                                be forced to admit that it is demanding the impossible of
                                Netherlands Government, the more so because Republican leaders have
                                not made it <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0250"/>perfectly clear
                                that they are also prepared to comply with first recommendation of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, namely, that they will cease
                                guerrilla warfare and will cooperate with Netherlands for
                                restoration peace and maintenance law and order. Netherlands
                                authority in Indonesia is for time being the only support for law
                                and order in those areas. This would be dealt irreparable blow if
                                Republican leaders [apparent garble] by close friends at home and
                                abroad—to release the political prisoners in compliance with
                                resolution of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. This release is not
                                among four points to which Van Royen objected. As I said earlier,
                                this is not criterion by which to judge whether release can take
                                place or not. Criterion is whether release is compatible with
                                responsibility of Netherlands for maintenance of freedom and
                                order.</p>
                            <p>“Whether that is the case will be immediately discussed with <gloss
                                    target="#t_HRC1">HRC</gloss>. It is clear that we shall do so if
                                it accords with our responsibility.”</p>
                            <p>The Governments of Netherlands and Indonesia are faced with two
                                difficult problems: On one hand, to prevent chaos in Indonesia and,
                                on other, to avoid a complete break with UN. These two problems
                                partly overlap. A complete break with UN is not a condition for
                                salvation of Indonesia. On other hand, strict compliance with
                                resolution of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would in our firm
                                conviction mean chaos in Indonesia. It is understandable that in
                                such critical situation some have wondered whether we ought to go
                                [on?] making tremendous sacrifices for Indonesia and whether we are
                                not obliged to leave Indonesia to its fate. The government could not
                                entertain such a thought. The government would not abandon
                                Indonesia. It was government’s duty to lead the people.</p>
                            <p>Maarseveen then referred to Beel’s “constructive proposals” which
                                government had approved in principle. Government was prepared to
                                cooperate in transfer sovereignty as soon as representative federal
                                government for whole of Indonesia had been established.
                                Simultaneously with transfer, statute of Netherlands–Indonesia union
                                would have to be created and treaties on various subjects concluded.
                                After that <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> could organize their
                                regime independently and democratically in observance of union
                                statute and agreements concluded. If this plan to be realized, a
                                federal interim government would have to be established soonest
                                which up to transfer of sovereignty would exercise powers laid down
                                    <gloss target="#t_BIO1">BIO</gloss> decree with exception of
                                changes to be made in consultation. After creation of federal
                                interim government it can appoint delegation which together with
                                Netherlands delegation can draft union statute and further
                                agreements at round-table conference to be held in Netherlands [if
                                Republican leaders?] were to be restored to their authority in
                                Djocja. But if Republican leaders are willing to cooperate with
                                Netherlands fully and completely, then they will be <pb n="237"
                                    xml:id="pg_237" facs="0251"/>given a share not only in
                                administration of Djocja and its surroundings but in the government
                                of the United States of the whole of Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>“Resolution of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for the realization
                                of Dutch aims wishes to make use of United Nations Commission for
                                Indonesia. Leaving aside for the moment whether parties concerned
                                arrived at agreement without this Commission, there can be no
                                objection that this Commission use its influence with both parties
                                for realization of program drafted by Netherlands and recognized by
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> as effective for the rapid
                                development of Indonesia into sovereign federal state united with
                                Netherlands in a union.</p>
                            <p>“According to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution, however,
                                this Commission and also <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> has wider
                                powers. The Commission and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> can
                                according to resolution concern itself with those areas being
                                administrated by participating governments who in harmony with
                                Netherlands Government have succeeded in realizing order and a
                                restoration of property and economic well-being. This and other
                                presumptions of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> cannot be accepted
                                by Netherlands Government and constitute an intolerable violation of
                                the internal sovereignty of the States of the UN.”</p>
                            <p>Van Maarseveen recalled that this point was stressed by Van Royen in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. He quoted the four points in
                                draft resolution to which Van Royen said Dutch Government had
                                “fundamental objections.”</p>
                            <p>Maarseveen recalled Van Royen’s statement as to extent to which the
                                resolution insofar as it is compatible with responsibility of the
                                Netherlands for maintenance of genuine freedom and order in
                                Indonesia, [“] a responsibility which at this moment no one else can
                                take over from us.”</p>
                            <p>“There,” said Maarseveen, “is the formula which, is the foundation of
                                the further policy of Netherlands Government, a policy which
                                maintains unchanged the attitude that <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> has exceeded its authority.</p>
                            <p>“Perhaps I may explain the signficance of this formula with an
                                example. [”] The Netherlands Government has been urged—also all
                                [apparent garble] with view to speediest possible transfer
                                sovereignty. Netherlands regards this Beel plan suitable to bridge
                                existing differences and reach common goal including Security
                                Council’s. He said it would be necessary for Republican Government
                                to join in discussions.</p>
                            <p>He thought it better for success of talks that parties did not first
                                try to reach agreement about their respective positions because
                                latter should be result of the consultations. He believed necessary
                                consultations could take place only if Netherlands did not ask
                                Republican Government first to recognize a certain formulation of
                                its position just as Netherlands could not accept a demand by
                                Republican Government that Netherlands agree with view that any
                                discussion should <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0252"/>be
                                preceded by restoration of certain rights. Only real condition for
                                consultations was that they take place in full freedom and frankness
                                and Netherlands prepared to create that condition.</p>
                            <p>If parties’ wish discussions including those on establishment interim
                                government to be held in Netherlands, and if <gloss

                            <p>Mr. Helb telephoned to say that he considered it important that we
                                promptly advise the Netherlands’ authorities, through our Embassy at
                                The Hague, that Merle Cochran’s appointment as Ambassador to
                                Pakistan would not interfere with his duties as U.S. Representative
                                on <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d174fn1">The Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Bulletin</hi>, February 20, 1949, p. 228, stated: “H. Merle
                                    Cochran, U.S. Representative on the [U.N.S.C.] Commission [for
                                    Indonesia], has been nominated by the President to be Ambassador
                                    to Pakistan. Due to the critical state of the Indonesian
                                    situation, Mr. Cochran will continue his work with the
                                    Commission until conditions warrant his departure for Karachi to
                                    assume his duties there.”</note> Helb said that those in the
                                Government who had been opposed to Cochran as not being qualified
                                for the job in Batavia would characterize his appointment as
                                Ambassador as “a kick up stairs”. Those who felt we were to blame
                                for continued Security Council intervention would use the
                                appointment to emphasize our lack of seriousness in allowing a
                                situation to arise in which vital Netherlands’ interests would be
                                handled by the “number two man” on our Delegation. Helb added that
                                the Dutch press could be expected to make much of this, and that he
                                hoped we would do the necessary, via Embassy Hague, to prevent it,
                                particularly at the very time when the Government appeared to be
                                “coming around a bit” and viewing the situation “unemotionally”.</p>
                            <p>Helb didn’t say so in so many words, but I believe what he had in
                                mind was that a great deal of the effect of Cochran’s talks in The
                                    <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0253"/>Hague would be
                                dissipated unless we were quick to emphasize that he was still in a
                                position to carry out his duties as U.S. Representative on the
                                Commission. I think his reference to Cochran’s appointment as “a
                                kick up stairs” probably means he fears that the appointment, unless
                                fully and promptly explained, may be interpreted as a weakening in
                                our basic position.</p>

                                two points in no way indicated deviation from UN on other points.
                                Republicans agreed two essential but do not consider they would have
                                genuine freedom unless and until restored to authority in Jogja as
                                provided by resolution. I said I had not tried envisage either in
                                Washington or Hague step by step procedures that should be followed
                                other than on two points above mentioned until I might have
                                opportunity return Batavia and find how Republicans view situation.
                                They replied they would abide by resolution although some parts
                                perhaps not entirely to their liking and would insist upon carrying

                            <p>Hatta and Sukarno explained any appeal by them to their followers to
                                lay down arms would be futile and disregarded unless they speak

                                requested advice as to how they thought return to Jogja could be
                                effected. I said we put certain provisions in resolution to assure
                                freedom of communication and economic support but I was not sure
                                what measures could be taken which would guarantee security for

                            <p>Above discussions at round table. Republicans took definite position
                                they would not consider themselves free to reach official decisions

                                on reestablishment Jogja implemented. When I mentioned short-cut
                                plan with early transfer sovereignty, Republicans asked how much

                                given no definite answer this point by Netherlands Ministers. Had
                                opportunity long talk with Sukarno alone and then with Hatta. Both
                                thanked me warmly for what they felt I had been doing. I said I was

                                done by US in Washington, Lake Success and Hague to work out of
                                present situation into fair solution for Indonesia. I said much

                                practical and reasonable. Republicans assured me in turn they would
                                be reasonable. Said I felt reestablishment Jogja should be
                                considered as means permitting Republic authorities draw in leaders
                                from all areas in order that consultation and agreement may be
                                achieved and effective call for laying down arms made. Thought this
                                should be emphasized rather than any attempt rebuild Republic to
                                former proportions. Made point however that <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> did not recognize Netherlands military action as
                                eliminating one party to dispute on its calendar. I let two leaders
                                know secretly my thought Stikker if given full powers negotiate
                                would have best chance achieving early agreement between parties. I
                                said no certainty this will result but we should be patient few days
                                until outcome Hague crisis seen. Republicans in good health and

                                uncertainty as to how this could be done. Republicans will write

                                emphasized to Republicans as I had to Dutch that responsibility for

                                Critchley circulated draft letter to Netherlands Delegation,
                                referring <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>’s report to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> February 15 seeking delay and
                                press reports Netherlands Minister’s statement in Lower House. He
                                thought latter indicated government would not immediately release
                                Republican leaders and restore authority Jogja. Draft continued: “If
                                this is indeed policy Netherlands Government there is no
                                justification for Commission delaying its report. It would,
                                therefore, be appreciated if you would inform Commission early as
                                possible whether report of Minister’s statement truly reflects views
                                Netherlands Government in these respects.” I argued for delay
                                pending receipt full translation Minister’s statement which
                                Netherlands Delegation promised us and also for the Netherlands
                                Government decisions expected shortly. I contended we should not
                                revive February 15 report before March 1 if statements from Hague
                                simply reiterate Van Royen’s. With due caution as to optimism, urged
                                we await further development of what appears to be move Hague toward
                                progressive implementation.</p>

                            <p>Schuurman telephoned this morning that lengthy government statement
                                he anticipated would be made 11 a. m. Hague yesterday had apparently
                                been only brief statement. He thought comprehensive statement
                                government policy on Indonesia thus being postponed. Said he had
                                telegraphed Hague promptly following my yesterday’s visit in order

                            <p>Visited this morning by all members Republican group Batavia. I told
                                them Schuurman telegraphed Hague my report Republicans insisting on
                                re-establishment Jogja. I urged and they promised refrain from any
                                unhappy statements while debate continuing Hague. In answer my
                                question they said approximately 3,000 Netherlands soldiers Jogja.
                                Said surrounding area except two small towns entirely in Republican

                                accomplished only by heavily armored convoys. Thought if Netherlands
                                agree withdraw from Jogja, Republican authority could be
                                re-established quickly and easily. Republicans understand

                            <p>Hamid stated always favored release Republicans. Thought they should

                                said resolution still recognizes existence Republican Government and
                                envisages restoration civil authority Jogja. This considered
                                necessary for consultation with scattered leaders and effective

                                doubted effectiveness such appeal at best. Cited evidence some

                                forces not favorable to restoration Jogja. I said attempt should be

                                appeal. Envisaged progressive steps necessary and admitted there
                                would eventually remain terrorist groups and free operators who
                                would not respond and would have to be dealt with militarily. I
                                constantly argued favor steps toward cessation hostilities rather
                                than debate among Indonesians as to form government. Made major
                                point, however, that progress depends entirely this juncture upon
                                Netherlands Government decision. Indicated willingness receive Hamid

                            <p>As the Netherlands Government is aware, the United States Government
                                is extremely regretful of the circumstances which have led to an
                                increasingly complex and difficult situation in Indonesia. The
                                United States Government is therefore in no sense desirous of
                                exacerbating further a situation which has already given rise to a
                                difference of view between our two governments.</p>
                            <p>In frankness, however, this Government thinks that it is appropriate
                                to invite the attention of the Netherlands Government to the
                                following considerations.</p>
                            <p>The United Nations Commission for Indonesia, created under the
                                Security Council Resolution of January 28, 1949, will be faced by
                                March 1, next, with the duty of reporting to the Security Council on
                                the progress of events in Indonesia, with particular reference to
                                steps which have been taken in fulfillment of the resolution of the
                                Security <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0261"/>Council of January
                                28. During the interval since the adoption of the above-mentioned
                                resolution, representatives of the United States Government have, in
                                numerous conversations with officials of the Netherlands Government,
                                attempted to make clear the steadfastness of this Government
                                regarding the program outlined in the resolution concerning
                                Indonesia. If the Commission on March 1 is obliged to report to the
                                Security Council that steps have not been taken by. The Netherlands
                                in conformity with the resolution, this Government will again take
                                its stand in unequivocal support of the fulfillment of the Security
                                Council’s Resolution of January 28, 1949.</p>
                            <p>It is our earnest hope that the Government of The Netherlands will
                                see its way clear to acceptance of the Security Council’s Resolution
                                in question, and will demonstrate its acceptance by prompt measures
                                designed to carry out the provisions of this resolution with the
                                assistance of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. It is
                                only by this means that the Government of the United States can
                                discern an end to the increasing difficulties to which this
                                unfortunate situation has given rise for all parties concerned.</p>

                                        March 12 if possible, should be considered as an effort of
                                        the Netherlands Govt to contribute to the conclusion of a
                                        speedy and definite agreement. The Netherlands Govt is fully

                                    <item>The Netherlands Govt feels that all efforts should be made
                                        to terminate the negotiations for an unconditional transfer
                                        of sovereignty on May 1st, 1949, and to further the
                                        ratification immediately afterwards. By that date agreement
                                        should be reached concerning the union-statute and the
                                        financial-economic and military agreements. The Netherlands
                                        Govt sincerely hopes to establish this future relationship
                                        on the basis of what both parties voluntarily will accept as
                                        joint interests and purposes. Inasmuch [<hi rend="italic"

                                        reached on the proposed date, special transitional
                                        arrangements will have to be made for such subjects as well
                                        as for the adaptation of the civil service, the withdrawal
                                        of military forces and other problems. These transitional
                                        arrangements will remain in force for a short time to be
                                        agreed upon by mutual consultation, after the transfer of

                                <p>It is of the opinion that a situation should be created as soon

                                <p>The Netherlands Government is convinced that this situation which
                                    the resolution of the Security Council of January 28, 1949 has
                                    set as a goal to be reached by 1 July 1950 at the latest can be
                                    created at a considerably earlier moment by the sincere and
                                    energetic co-operation of all interested parties.</p>
                                <p>In view of this the Netherlands Government has conceived the idea
                                    to take the initiative for a round-table conference of all
                                    parties concerned in the Indonesian question which could
                                    commence at The Hague as soon as possible—preferably on March
                                    12, 1949. At the conference the conditions and moralities [<hi

                            <p>Mr. van Kleffens and Mr. Helb called at their request. Mr. van
                                Kleffens said he wished to leave with us a copy of a communication
                                which was being delivered at The Hague to the Belgian, Canadian,
                                French, British and United States Ambassadors, setting forth the
                                position on Indonesia which the Netherlands Government had <pb
                                    n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0265"/>adopted. He requested that
                                the contents of this memorandum be made known to the Secretary. He
                                also requested that we regard the communication as secret until it
                                was released by the Netherlands’ authorities in Batavia upon the
                                return there of Dr. Beel. (Copy of the communication is
                                    attached<note n="1" xml:id="d182fn1">See telegram 187, February

                            <p>Mr. van Kleffens read to us the communication. He said that his
                                knowledge of it was limited to the text and that he was therefore
                                not in a position to elaborate. He said that he felt, however, that
                                this was a major step forward; that it represented a real attempt on
                                the part of the Netherlands Government to meet the “essentials” of
                                the position of the Security Council expressed in its resolution of
                                January 28, 1949; and that he hoped that the U.S. Government would
                                be able to support the proposal contained therein to the full.</p>
                            <p>In accepting the memorandum, I stated that I would not want to give
                                an official reaction to it without thorough study; that I would wish
                                to take it up with the Secretary; and that I would meanwhile seek
                                some clarification of the Dutch proposal.</p>
                            <p>In the ensuing conversation the following points regarding the Dutch
                                plan came out:</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Numbered paragraph 6 was interpreted by Mr. van Kleffens to
                                    mean that Republican leaders would be given full liberty, but
                                    that they would not be restored to governmental authority in
                                    Jogja or elsewhere. In this connection I suggested that the
                                    phrase “to consult with them concerning their residence” might
                                    well be deleted, inasmuch as it seemed to imply some restriction
                                    on their liberty of movement.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Mr. van Kleffens interpreted the first sentence of paragraph
                                    10 as meaning that sovereignty would be transferred on May 1,
                                    1949, subject only to those conditions expressed in the latter
                                    part of this paragraph.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>I inquired why the Netherlands Government felt that more
                                    progress could be made in negotiations at The Hague than in
                                    Java. Mr. van Kleffens replied that better progress had been
                                    made in negotiations with the Federalists at The Hague and that
                                    he felt the same would be true at the proposed round-table
                                    discussions.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Mr. van Kleffens emphasized that the Netherlands Government
                                    plan seemed to him significant and progressive as much for what
                                    it did not say—e.g., it set no conditions precedent, such as the
                                    cessation of guerilla activity—as for what it did say.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>It was inferentially brought to the Ambassador’s attention
                                    that the plan did not seem totally consistent with the Security
                                    Council Resolution. I agreed, however, to give it careful
                                    attention and to let him know the Department’s views as promptly
                                    as possible.</item>

                            <p>In handing communication, van Kleffens stated that his info largely
                                confined to text, and therefore he was not in position to elaborate,
                                but personally considered decision reached in Hague real step
                                forward. Upon questioning, he expressed personal view that numbered
                                para 6 of communication rejects idea restoration Repub Govt at
                                Jogja, though remainder of plan attempts meet all essentials of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> position and it will be noted
                                does not require conditions precedent such as stoppage of guerilla
                                activities to acceptance of invitation.</p>
                            <p>In accepting communication, Asst. Sec stated that he would wish to
                                study text thoroughly, to discuss it with Secy, and could therefore
                                give no official reaction at this time.</p>
                            <p>Without attempting prejudice your reactions, which <gloss

                                following is point which might require action by <gloss

                                Departmental study your views and issuance any further
                                instructions.</p>
                            <p>Although Dutch proposal does not specifically exclude restoration
                                Republican Govt in Jogja, Netherlands Amb here, as already noted,
                                indicated his view that such would in fact not be acceptable. This
                                point appears to be critical as between Dutch and Republicans on one
                                hand and as between Dutch plan and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution on the other. Present likelihood is therefore that
                                Republicans will immediately reject Dutch plan on Jogja point. If
                                tins should occur, particularly if this point appears to be sole
                                obstacle, we suggest <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> should
                                immediately attempt to bring about direct and urgent negotiations
                                between Dutch and Republican representatives to resolve this point.
                                If complete impasse develops between parties, <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> might attempt through informal

                                resolving Jogja point can be found. Care should be taken not, to
                                commit this Govt, however, to support any settlement which differs
                                from Security Council resolution unless agreed to by both

                            <p>Mr. Daridan called at his request and showed me two telegrams which
                                his Embassy had received from the French Foreign Minister. The first
                                telegram described in very general terms the Beel plan, which will
                                be announced tomorrow in Batavia and The Hague. The second telegram
                                directed the French Embassy in Washington to ascertain the
                                Department’s attitude toward the plan as well as the possibility of
                                its support of that plan. The French Foreign Minister expressed the
                                hope that Mr. Cochran could impress upon the Republican leadership
                                the desirability of an immediate settlement of the problem and the
                                sincerity of the Netherlands as evidenced in their willingness to
                                transfer sovereignty on the first of May. During a long and somewhat
                                discursive conversation which followed I told Mr. Daridan (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) that Mr. Cochran would continue to devote
                                his energies and his ingenuity to bringing the parties together on
                                the basis of any plan which was mutually agreeable; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">b</hi>) that the Security Council’s Commission for
                                Indonesia would be obliged to report to the Council on March 1 in
                                    <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0268"/>pursuance of the
                                January 28 resolution; that the Council, and only the Council, could
                                decide whether the Dutch proposals complied with the spirit or the
                                letter of the January 28 resolution; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that
                                the United Nations Commission for Indonesia could not go to The
                                Hague, in my opinion, without the permission or perhaps the
                                direction of the Security Council since it was clear that the
                                Netherlands would invite the Commission under such conditions as the
                                Netherlands considered desirable and that it would be improper for
                                the Commission to operate within a frame of reference differing
                                substantially from that provided it in the January 28 resolution;
                                and (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that whatever the merits of the plan,
                                the Republic would undoubtedly cling to the January 28 resolution
                                since the Netherlands proposals do not restore Republican leadership
                                to Jogja.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Daridan made it clear that his Government hoped that Mr. Cochran,
                                in his capacity as an official of the Department of State rather
                                than as a member of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>, might
                                persuade the Republicans to accept the Dutch proposals. I pointed
                                out that whether or not he was willing to do so, Mr. Cochran would
                                undoubtedly find it extremely difficult to convince the Republicans
                                of the desirability of their accepting the plan; that if Mr. Cochran
                                made such an approach to the Republic, the Australian representative
                                would undoubtedly register strong objections to the plan, both with
                                the Indonesian Republicans and the Security Council; that India
                                would probably do likewise and that Mr. Cochran might find himself,
                                as a result, in an embarrassing position.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Daridan said that he fully recognized the great difficulties
                                which would face the Department and Mr. Cochran in approaching the
                                Republicans as his Government had suggested. He realized, moreover,
                                that the Netherlands had given the Government of the United States
                                and the Government of France virtually no time to make constructive
                                suggestions as to the subject matter of the plan or the manner of
                                its presentation; that in effect, the Netherlands Government was
                                presenting interested parties with a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                    d’accompli</hi> and expecting their support. I agreed.</p>

                            <p>193. In our recent conversations with Boon (<gloss
                                    target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>s 171, February 19 and 180,

                                    facs="0269"/>during protracted Indonesian crisis thoroughly
                                gloomy. February 21 he remarked that conditions re Djocja mentioned
                                by Hatta to Cochran for resumption negotiations had created
                                consternation in Dutch Cabinet. Subsequently, Boon remarked that,
                                contrary to impression left by Cochran in The Hague, he now seemed,
                                after his talks on Bangka, to be backing Hatta’s third demand, viz.,
                                restoration Republic at Djocja. Parenthetically would like say that
                                Boon is most reasonable, rational and straightforward Foreign Office
                                official with whom Embassy deals on Indonesia and has complete
                                confidence Stikker and Lovink.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday we had further talk with Boon with view seeing how firm
                                Dutch are in rejecting idea Republic return Djocja, making clear our
                                approach purely personal and without instructions. Boon said
                                Netherlands Government fearful that with restoration Republic chaos
                                would ensue and Republican leaders would pursue procrastinating
                                methods characteristic in past and refuse to open negotiations until
                                further conditions had been met.</p>
                            <p>We said rigid positions being taken by both parties re Republic’s
                                return Djocja seemed likely result complete impasse, with Dutch in
                                position of conflict with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution, at time when <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                about submit March 1 report <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Such
                                development could have most unfavorable consequences for
                                Netherlands, particularly in respect its efforts stage Indonesian
                                conference Hague mid-March. We went on to state Dutch attitude re
                                return Djocja was in some fundamental respects inconsistent with
                                government’s proposal (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                                187, February 23) to transfer sovereignty as of May 1. Proposal must
                                be viewed with some doubt if Netherlands not prepared work out means
                                for Republicans to prepare soon to assume responsibility government,
                                particularly law and order within federated state.</p>

                                opinion aimed at restoration Republican Government at Djocja for two
                                immediate purposes:</p>
                            <list>

                                <item>Give them prestige and authority necessary embark on
                                    negotiations. No one could deny Republican leaders were impotent
                                    stop guerrillas unless they were released and restored to
                                    authority. Re second point, viz., prestige, we asked Boon if he
                                    thought compromise might be arranged whereby Netherlands agreed
                                    restoration but on condition Republicans agree to commence
                                    negotiations at round table conference Hague within early
                                    definite time limit.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>Boon, after indicating early in discussion that Netherlands
                                Government must absolutely refuse agree re Djocja, finally said, in
                                his personal opinion, Netherlands Government could not take any
                                initiative now resolve this problem but would certainly listen any
                                “ingenious <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0270"/>proposal” which
                                Cochran or <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> might put
                                forward to break deadlock. He indicated Netherlands Government
                                pinning all its hopes upon convening round table conference Hague
                                and went on to indicate Netherlands might be prepared “pay a high
                                price in Djocja for agreement to negotiations The Hague.”</p>
                            <p>Foreign Office fully aware urgency this matter, particularly view
                                approaching March 1 deadline and Embassy believes Dutch would not
                                turn their backs if Cochran were to advance proposal for compromise
                                along lines that would save Republicans’ face and same time give
                                Dutch assurance law and order will not be jeopardized and
                                Republicans are not simply given opportunity avoid negotiations and
                                coming to agreements in sense contemplated both by Dutch and under
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. This would involve
                                something of a marriage between Beel plan and <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution, which, upon close examination, does not
                                seem be out of question, but in fact has much to commend it. It
                                might go long way to strengthen Cabinet’s shaky position.</p>

                                “Re-establishment of Repub Government in Jogja would give fatal blow
                                to confidence of certain persons and political organizations in
                                possibility of cooperation with Netherlands. It would mean
                                encouragement of unconciliatory elements of Repub to abide by their
                                    <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0271"/>inflexible attitude.
                                Every social rehabilitation would be retarded, lives of Chinese
                                population would be endangered. Tan Malakka would be stimulated to
                                greater activity, guerrilla warfare and terrorism would flare up to
                                unknown extent, it would be impossible maintain any authority in
                                Jogja and cooperation of Netherlands forces in maintenance of law
                                and order would [then] be extremely difficult, if not impossible. A
                                new demarcation line would recreate chaos in field of economics,
                                finance and communications, internal security would disappear
                                completely ‘and terrorism would prevail. Repub Government, which
                                already in past was unable to suppress this terrorism to any extent,
                                would now be at mercy of extremists. Information contained in
                                selections of documents submitted to you on infiltrations and
                                subversive activities from Repub controlled territory has now been
                                confirmed by documentary evidence from Repub archives; comprehensive
                                note on this matter will be completed shortly. Absolute certitude
                                    [<hi rend="italic">certainty</hi>] that every possibility of
                                reaching agreement and of successfully conducting negotiations would
                                be frustrated by terrorism, infiltrations and subversive activities
                                from Jogja does not permit Netherlands Government in view its
                                responsibility to allow return of Repub Government to Jogja, since
                                this would be tantamount to barring in advance possibility of
                                achieving speedy transfer of sovereignty as envisaged under regular
                                conditions.”</p>
                            <p>Schuurman handed me following communication dated February 23: “My
                                Dear Cochran, I have asked Schuurman to hand you a note which we
                                have addressed today to several friendly governments.</p>
                            <p>I had hoped come for short visit to Batavia to assist in trying find
                                solution our very complicated problems which are facing all of us,
                                but political situation in Holland since resignation of Sassen
                                remains unstable which prevents me from leaving country at this
                                moment.</p>
                            <p>In view of very critical circumstances and bearing in mind frank and
                                pleasant discussions during your recent visit to Hague I feel that a
                                personal message might contribute to clarify situation.</p>
                            <p>Postponement of first report of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> from February 15 to March 1 has given Netherlands
                                Government valuable time to complete discussions with High
                                Representative of Crown and to reach definite conclusions concerning
                                future policy. I want you to know how much I have appreciated
                                attitude of members of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> in
                                this matter.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately pressure of time elements remains to large extent
                                because Netherlands Government will only be able announce decisions
                                after arrival Beel in Batavia which is scheduled for Saturday,
                                February 26. We are fast approaching date of March 1 on which first
                                report of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should be made. I trust you will
                                understand that in view of tense situation in Indonesia such
                                far-reaching decisions <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0272"/>as
                                were taken can only be announced after return of highest Netherlands
                                representative to Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>I would like make most urgent appeal to give favorable consideration
                                to proposals which Schuurman will explain to you. Personally I do
                                not see any way out if Repub would refuse come Holland for
                                discussions. For nearly three years now negotiations have taken
                                place in Indonesia. Ministers of Netherlands Government have gone
                                Indonesia several times. Cabinet delegations in which I participated
                                have gone Jogja under most difficult circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Netherlands Government has taken momentous decision to transfer its
                                sovereignty at earliest possible date and discuss this transfer with
                                all parties. Hague seems to be most logical choice for proposed
                                conference because it is Dutch Government which is transferring
                                sovereignty. You will agree atmosphere in Holland is far better than
                                in Batavia.</p>
                            <p>If during proposed round table conference unforeseen complications
                                should arise I would personally be willing do all I can straighten
                                them out.</p>
                            <p>With regard to opening date of conference I would like explain to you
                                that March 12 is only few days before deadline of resolution of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. First we had in mind March 7
                                but amongst other things because of transportation difficulties it
                                was clearly impossible get every one assembled such short notice. On
                                tenth we have here Hague a <gloss target="#t_Benelux1"
                                    >Benelux</gloss> meeting. Therefore there was no possibility
                                meet earlier.</p>
                            <p>Present Netherlands Government takes realistic view of situation and
                                future relationship which will be embodied in union statute and
                                other arrangements. They see quite clearly that transfer of
                                sovereignty should mean real and full sovereignty for Indonesia and
                                not sovereignty restricted to such extent that <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> authority would remain with Netherlands. Therefore I
                                do not feel that unsoluble difficulties will arise.</p>
                            <p>You and I have always believed that difficulties could be solved
                                round conference table. To call such conference should be first aim
                                of all who wish arrive at speedy and lasting solution of present
                                difficulties. Netherlands Government has made first move in lifting
                                restrictions on movements of Repub leaders. A genuinely free and
                                open conference should be next step.</p>
                            <p>If on other hand <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> would
                                demand return of their government to Jogja before they participate
                                in any discussions I am convinced that discussions will become
                                impossible on Netherlands side. Therefore I venture presume upon
                                your personal influence with Repub leaders to convince Sukarno arid
                                others that they accept invitation. Recent events have shaken
                                confidence on both sides but we cannot let <pb n="259"
                                    xml:id="pg_259" facs="0273"/>our sentiments prevail. Much higher
                                interests are at stake than personal feelings or opinions of those
                                who take part in discussions. It is fate of Indonesia and Holland
                                and to certain extent future relationship between east and west that
                                is at stake.</p>
                            <p>Experience has taught both of us to be careful with predictions but
                                we hope to terminate the work by May 1, which would probably also
                                suit your personal plans.</p>
                            <p>I know how hard and patiently you have labored to bring parties
                                together. I have tried to facilitate your task and therefore I feel
                                as an honest man that I should inform you that I have done
                                everything possible to create conditions for fresh start. It is up
                                to you now to make best use of possibilities which situation
                                offers.</p>
                            <p>If it would help to talk over phone please tell Schuurman so I can
                                ring you up.</p>
                            <p>With kindest regards,</p>
                            <p>Above text is in conformity with telegram received today from
                                Netherlands Foreign Minister Stikker.” Signed Schuurman, acting
                                chairman Netherlands delegation.</p>
                            <p>Schuurman said also giving Herremans copy first memorandum. Said no
                                one should know of Stikker’s letter except ourselves. Requested I
                                maintain absolute secrecy re fact of memorandum having been handed
                                me but desired I have this material for advance information and
                                study. Said Beel scheduled arrive Batavia Saturday morning and would
                                make public statement 6 p. m. Batavia time on Indonesian program.
                                Presumes statement will include material set forth in memorandum to
                                Ambassadors. Said it also presumably would reveal Beel plan details
                                whereof Schuurman insists he has not received. Answer my query
                                Schuurman did not know whether Beel would have meeting with <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> or have documentation

                            <p>111. Dutch and Repub releases present wildly contradictory pictures

                            <p>At dinner I talked with Minister Leimena, ranking Republican
                                Government official Batavia. I told him not informed what all Beel
                                would announce Saturday evening but surmised statement might follow
                                lines Maarseveen speech February 16 and possibly refuse restoration
                                Jogja and offer conference elsewhere. Said we should all study
                                statement carefully. Suggested Republicans make no reply either
                                affirmative or negative to any proposals Netherlands might extend
                                until they consult <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> members.
                                I told Leimena Republicans had good record with <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. If Netherlands might now assume

                                    >SC</gloss> resolution, they might have difficulty deciding or

                                themselves would, however, have to make decision whether reply at
                                once to Netherlands or inform <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"

                                done.</p>
                            <p>Later in evening talked with Critchley. He was, of course, unaware
                                documentation provided Herremans and me. He doubted Beel’s coming
                                statement would relieve <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                necessity report noncompliance March 1. He said he regretted
                                Netherlands not moving more helpfully. He appreciated unfavorable
                                report involves risks. He said critical report and strong pressure
                                by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and Asiatics might move
                                Netherlands to implement <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution and consummate really acceptable and final arrangement.
                                On other hand, Netherlands might stubbornly refuse and then both
                                Netherlands and Indonesia suffer from sanctions that might ensue. He
                                thought therefore <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> should
                                not discard summarily any proposal Beel offers. He thought we should
                                study it carefully, see if we could encourage Republicans accept at
                                least part of it, and then ourselves work toward supplementing that
                                part with <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> material to form
                                basis of plan for interim government, et cetera. I agreed we should

                                statement on this point since explanations given me Hague and
                                Batavia have to date been neither precise nor consistent nor
                                convincing.</p>
                            <p>As Department knows, I had hoped Stikker might come Batavia shortly
                                after my arrival and personally undertake resumption negotiations
                                with Republicans and drawing in Federalists. His letter to me
                                explains why this impossible and states clearly he can do nothing
                                helpful unless Republicans accept Netherlands position on Jogja
                                restoration and proceed Hague for round table conference. It may be
                                that Republicans would be well advised accept this arrangement. If
                                they do, they risk losing support military and other scattered
                                leaders and suffering deep humiliation if Netherlands attitude does
                                not improve over that demonstrated to Republicans and to world in
                                past. Little can be done for Republicans in their present state of

                                negotiations are moved Hague and leading Republicans such as

                                been created for them from distance by unfavorable press, et cetera.
                                Some important advantages would accrue through having negotiations
                                removed from poisonous atmosphere Batavia where efforts Netherlands

                                frustrated by colonial die-hards and militarists. With <gloss

                                Netherlands reached would confirm this feeling.</p>
                            <p>As indicated in earlier telegrams on sketchily revealed Beel plan, I
                                have feared it might be conceived to circumvent <gloss

                                once look to us for support.</p>
                            <p>In going along with present Netherlands proposal, we risk seeing
                                consummated quick but ineffective agreement. Separated for possibly
                                months tedious arid trying Hague negotiations, Republican leaders
                                may lose even more support of nationalist following Indonesia,
                                Guerrilla and potential leftists may strengthen and “emergency
                                government” Sumatra attempts seize leadership Republican elements.
                                Unless Netherlands spirit undergoes genuine change, there is further
                                possibility that once Republican leaders are at Hague Netherlands
                                will use customary methods of documentary disclosures to weaken and
                                even destroy Republican leaders such as Sukarno and Hatta whom,
                                colonialists and militarists realize are ones most likely to achieve
                                successful sovereignty. If therefore we encourage Republicans accept
                                invitation, we should be conscious our own responsibility to see
                                they get squarer deal Hague than they have received here.</p>

                                    stated immediately that reconstitution Republic Jogja definitely
                                    rejected by Neth Govt, reading from note transmitted your 601 of

                                Government announced important conclusion had been reached between
                                this government and high representative Crown at Batavia concerning
                                policy to be pursued with regard to Indonesia.</p>

                            <p>Netherlands Government has therefore decided endeavour effectuate

                                eagerly aimed at justifies the confidence that all parties will show
                                their readiness to cooperate.</p>

                                concerning their wishes as to their future residence and
                                arrangements which will have to be made in this respect.</p>

                                <p>“Netherlands Government has decided take initiative to convene
                                    soon as possible round table conference which should start on
                                    March 12 at Hague.</p>
                                <p>To this conference all parties concerned with Indonesian question
                                    will be invited. It is intention government to consider at
                                    conference in particular conditions and modalities by which
                                    accelerated transfer sovereignty over Indonesia by Netherlands
                                    to representative Federal Indonesian Government will take place.
                                    As consequence this proposed transfer sovereignty, consultations
                                    will be necessary concerning provisions for interim period,
                                    including institution of Federal Interim Government.</p>
                                <p>Netherlands Government has been guided by conception that lasting
                                    solution of pending problems cannot be arrived at until
                                    sovereignty has actually been transferred. Experience has shown
                                    that arrangements for rather prolonged interim period lead to
                                    insoluble differences opinion.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, Netherlands Government have invited President of
                                    Republic and Chairman <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> to
                                    appoint delegations for this conference. Your commission will

                                    refer.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, it is intended that also representatives of Provisional
                                    Federal Government and of minorities of population will take
                                    part in this conference.</p>
                                <p>Netherlands Government have requested me inform your commission
                                    that they will highly appreciate it if your commission would
                                    attend this conference so that it can render assistance to

                                    their ability to speedy and complete solution of pending
                                    problems, Netherlands Government has again considered way in

                                <p>It is of opinion that situation should be created soon as
                                    possible in which conflict and mistrust of today give way to

                                    would in opinion of Netherlands Government not fully be reached

                                <p>In view this Netherlands Government has conceived idea take

                                    modalities will have to be discussed under which aforementioned
                                    accelerated transfer sovereignty can be effected as well as
                                    provisions for intermediary period including institution of
                                    Federal Interim Government.</p>
                                <p>Netherlands Government is prepared examine at conference on its

                                receive us Sunday 5 p. m. After talking with Schuurman we suggested
                                desirability earlier conference with Beel if latter might find it
                                convenient. Hour advanced from 5 p. m. to 12 noon. Subsequently,
                                Schuurman secretly asked me meet Beel, Koets and himself 10:15
                                Sunday morning.</p>
                            <p>Schuurman told us Beel delivered invitation Chairman Hamid <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> 2 p. m. today and Gieben flew
                                Bangka 3 p. m. today deliver invitation Sukarno and return Sunday.
                                Said Koets visiting Bangka Monday to give background since he had
                                been with Beel at Hague and to discuss situation with Republicans.
                                Was not sure whether Republicans would give answer to Koets or
                                whether they might desire further consultations perhaps to include
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>. We said initiative
                                presenting this proposal rests with Netherlands Government but it
                                available for consultation. We hoped be informed fully as possible
                                of steps taken and reactions of Federalists and Republicans thereto
                                prior submission our March 1 report. Schuurman doubted plans would
                                be resolved by that time. We stated report would definitely go
                                forward on fixed date.</p>
                            <p>We expressed surprise statement to press did not reveal more details
                                Beel plan. Schuurman admitted he had anticipated more precise
                                statement but learned on Beel’s return of decision taken make this
                                general statement containing two fundamentals, namely, Hague
                                Conference by March 12 and transfer sovereignty at earlier date than
                                anticipated by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution. He
                                admitted this procedure constitutes quite different plan from <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution but argued end purpose
                                same and offers accelerated program. Noting that no fixed date for
                                transfer is indicated in documents handed us today, Schuurman said
                                May 1, 1949 is target date for completion Hague negotiations to be
                                followed by submission agreement for ratification, etc. He conceded
                                that date for transfer sovereignty would depend on progress made and
                                parties’ attitude. When difficulty arriving at Hague Conference by
                                March 12 suggested, Schuurman said this date purposely fixed prior
                                March 15 <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0285"/>since thought no
                                provisional government could be set up then as anticipated by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution. Urgent therefore have
                                present plan under way before March 15.</p>
                            <p>Answering my question, Schuurman said unable state whether any
                                restrictions placed on number or identity Republic delegation. Said
                                Gieben and Koets would give some details orally to Sukarno.
                                Answering my question whether scattered Republican leaders including
                                military and emergency government Sumatra figures could be included
                                Republican Delegation, Schuurman expressed affirmative opinion but
                                again thought Beel should be asked confirm.</p>
                            <p>Schuurman insisted Republicans would have entire freedom movement
                                without surveillance Hague. Said Netherlands will now discuss with
                                Republican leaders question future residence. Will not be permitted
                                return Jogja as government or visit any former Republican territory
                                without military permits. Furthermore, will have to have advance
                                understanding with government as to where they establish residence
                                in Netherlands-controlled territory whether this be Batavia, Bandung
                                or elsewhere. We explained seeking precise information this point to
                                determine whether <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution met.
                                We were informed immediate decision concerns freedom Republican
                                leaders and not political prisoners as whole.</p>
                            <p>In talk following meeting <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                members expressed common disappointment Netherlands had not
                                presented more specific plan after consultations Hague and extension
                                time granted for our reporting. We feared present statement would
                                have poor press. Herremans thought it offered Republicans little
                                beyond opportunity for further discussions but thinks they should
                                agree go Hague. He stressed urgency settling Indonesian question.
                                Critchley expressed opinion strongly that Republicans could not
                                accept without losing support. Took position we no longer good

                                Beel, Koets and Schuurman this morning. Beel referred statement
                                handed <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> last night. I said
                                when in Washington had suggestion from Embassy Hague some short cut
                                plan conceived. At Hague had sought details but told by Netherlands
                                obtain them Batavia. Since arrival here had been informed Beel
                                discussing his plan Hague with possibility revision there and must
                                await revelation his return. I said long awaited statement issued
                                last night disappointing in not giving more specific plan.</p>

                                    >UNCFI</gloss> should be provided therewith not only since
                                Herremans and I embarrassed but principally because Netherlands case
                                would be clarified and strengthened by official submission thereof
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> and thence <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Beel agreed.</p>
                            <p>I advised group I had assumed responsibility obtaining fortnight
                                postponement <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> report but
                                this would have to be made March 1. I urged they give specific
                                information as possible re plans and intentions. I said would be
                                difficult convince Republicans they should give up <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution to accept new Netherlands
                                plan. I said in Hague I argued it would not be worthwhile for me
                                return Indonesia unless Netherlands willing release political
                                leaders at once and permit <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                function. I had explained Stikker and others that upon arrival
                                Batavia would see Republicans and ascertain their ideas on
                                procedures necessary if further implementation <gloss

                                considerations, sequence and negotiations. Immediately after first
                                and only contact with Republican leaders, I let Schuurman know they
                                adamant restoration Jogja. I had not any place any time presumed
                                oppose this or any provision <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution or excuse compliance with single Word. I said Republican
                                leaders not yet released; invitation <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> does not assure us opportunity enjoy full

                            <p>Republican leaders would be informed by Koets tomorrow at liberty
                                leave Bangka and return Batavia for instance whenever they wish.
                                Koets stated invitation envisaged <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> as party to roundtable discussion Hague. He said
                                his job sell Republicans confidence plan and asked my suggestions
                                and help.</p>
                            <p>I said his plan different from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution and initiative and responsibility rest with Netherlands.
                                I said had already asked Leimena not let his people refuse any
                                Netherlands proposal without consulting <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> members. This was my only contact with
                                Republicans since Shuurman gave me advance information re plan.
                                Koets said he would see Leimena this afternoon and endeavor convince
                                him virtue of plan.</p>
                            <p>I asked whether Netherlands Government had definite plan in mind for
                                presentation Hague Conference. They said nothing other than idea of
                                early transfer sovereignty. To my further inquiry as to whether they
                                would insist on <gloss target="#t_BIO1">BIO</gloss> being basis
                                negotiations they replied negatively. Said would take advantage any
                                agreement in principle arrived at earlier conversations between
                                Ministers and Republicans as on financial and economic matters.
                                Would not revert to positions which they had maintained with respect
                                authority <gloss target="#t_HRC1">HRC</gloss> and control of
                                military which had been stumbling blocks last autumn. They replied
                                they would not now after military action request Republicans accept
                                unconditionally points which Republicans had not agreed to
                                previously. Wanted roundtable conference to begin from fresh start
                                with no preconceived positions taken.</p>
                            <p>I argued their plan less satisfactory than <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution on point which they claim its fundamental
                                virtue, that is, date sovereignty transfer. I said their plan leaves
                                final transfer date unfixed and subject various conditions. I was
                                sure they would have to remedy this before either Republicans or
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would find acceptable. They
                                insisted plan was to transfer sovereignty soon as Netherlands
                                chambers ratified agreements. Hoped latter would be reached by May 1
                                and thought ratification should not take more than four to six
                                weeks. I foresaw further weakness their plan in drawing conservative
                                Republican leaders away from Indonesia without giving them
                                opportunity <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> envisaged of appealing
                                from seat of restored authority to followers to cease-fire. I said
                                support might be lost and extremist elements gain strength while
                                conservative group met at Hague. Stressed no matter how beautiful
                                paper agreement drawn up, execution thereof might be impossible if
                                conservative leaders lose following.</p>
                            <p>Response my query, informed Sukarno, Hatta could name delegation any
                                size desired including anyone. Netherlands Government intends hold
                                March 12 conference irrespective Republican reply. That is, they <pb
                                    n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0288"/>insist on setting up
                                government to which sovereignty can be transferred soonest. I said
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution had virtue
                                providing for carefully spaced stages which should give <gloss
                                    target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> safer foundation which to build
                                than will be given through hastily organized government taking over
                                mass of military, financial and economic problems on short notice.
                                They admitted idea interim government might be skipped entirely
                                dependent upon will of roundtable conference. Said nine
                                parliamentary leaders who have visited Indonesia in past and
                                particularly interested this question would participate in
                                roundtable. Thought this should facilitate ratification any plan
                                reached. There would be three representatives of minorities in
                                Indonesia, namely Arabs, Chinese, Eurasians. Group took pains
                                endeavor assure me no hidden phases to plan and everything
                                aboveboard in inviting us all Hague roundtable conference.</p>
                            <p>Beel referred Stikker’s letter to me (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1"
                                    >Gocus</gloss> 601). I asked if Stikker would participate
                                conference, mentioning he indicated readiness join if assistance
                                needed, and also in final paragraph letter took position he had gone
                                as far as he could and job was now up to me. Said I presumed
                                Stikker’s English had not conveyed his exact ideas but I insisted
                                job belonged Netherlands and not me. Beel said round-table would
                                have Netherlands delegation from Hague presumably under chairmanship
                                Overseas Minister and include either Stikker or other high
                                representative from Foreign Office Finance Ministry and others high
                                rank. I urged group have as much material as possible ready for
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> meeting would be
                                forthright in stating position.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> group met with above trio
                                at noon. Schuurman delivered formal memo providing almost verbatim
                                copy memo to Ambassadors Hague and exact copy memo re Netherlands
                                opposition restoration Jogja (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1"
                                    >Gocus</gloss> 601). Beel asked Koets explain Netherlands
                                Government position. Koets covered practically same ground as in
                                earlier meeting including rather satisfactory answers to questions
                                which I had posed. We three stressed our loyalty <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution but our desire see
                                satisfactory settlement reached soonest and our noninterference with
                                any direct negotiations between parties. Netherlands realized their
                                task sell Republicans and Federals. Koets was to undertake former.
                                We stressed importance Republicans attach restoration Jogja and
                                definitive date for unconditional transfer sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>When we sought specific answers on prerogatives <gloss
                                    target="#t_HRC1">HRC</gloss> in interim period and in emergency,
                                Beel insisted on readiness Netherlands eliminate interim period
                                entirely or shorten it to limit agreed upon by parties. Netherlands
                                thought there should be no difficulty on economic and financial
                                measures. Said willing approve Federal army under Indonesian command
                                once sovereignty transferred and to withdraw <pb n="275"
                                    xml:id="pg_275" facs="0289"/>Netherlands forces on agreed
                                schedule. When we pointed out paragraph 10 memo of procedure would
                                indicate more doubt than they now declare as to transfer sovereignty
                                unconditionally, Beel again assured US government had taken definite
                                decision transfer sovereignty soonest and will not place diffculties
                                in way reaching clear cut agreement thereon.</p>
                            <p>Netherlands repeated invitation to <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> and assured us privilege participating general
                                and committee discussions Hague with right advance suggestions and
                                generally assist parties. Koets hedged slightly by stating Van
                                Royen’s speech had contained some opposition to <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> and that government adhered
                                this statement. Exchange ideas did not reveal prohibitions which
                                should hinder our endeavoring assist.</p>
                            <p>When we complained lack details in Beel plan, Netherlands replied
                                purposely leaving open forum Hague for presentation whatever plans
                                parties agree upon but with genuine intention Netherlands side reach
                                settlement by May 1 target date. We said Netherlands case would be
                                more favorably understood by Indonesians, <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> and public
                                if more specific information, especially on points we had discussed,
                                released by Netherlands Government. Koets promised be specific in
                                talks with Republicans. We said could well utilize anything further
                                they give us in writing prior submission our report. We argued this
                                should be more helpful in presenting Netherlands case fairly and
                                accurately to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> than depending upon
                                Van Royen’s answering questions perhaps of embarrassing character
                                that will be posed. They promised give us one or two additional
                                documents but did not commit themselves to put in writing what they
                                had said in meeting. It was understood we were available for
                                consultation by Republicans and Federals but initiative was with
                                Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Talking later with Herremans and Critchley, they both agreed
                                Netherlands has presented case poorly to public if their oral
                                statements to us can be accepted face value. To me alone Herremans

                            <p>203. Initial Foreign Office reaction to statement by Mohammed Rum
                                that Republicans will not attend proposed Hague conference is that
                                the door is not firmly closed but that things “don’t look so good.”
                                It is opinion of myself and other Embassy officers that Dutch
                                proposals represent thorough-going and honest attempt to bring about

                                been arrived at only through long and hard fought negotiations in
                                four-party Cabinet. From our conversations with Stikker and other
                                government officials it is evident that Dutch believe they have now
                                offered a genuine constructive method of cutting the Gordian knot
                                (Queen Juliana would not have left the country on holiday to Austria
                                last week if she did not believe so). Dutch proposals constitute a
                                victory for moderate elements in Cabinet and if conference or some
                                agreement does not result repercussions here would be very bad, in
                                government circles, in press and among public. Political crisis of
                                first magnitude accompanied by collapse Dutch morale with
                                unpredictable consequences would be distinct possibility.</p>
                            <p>Dutch, have never been sanguine that Republicans would accept
                                invitation unless Cochran was himself convinced and able to persuade
                                them that this was quickest and surest way to ultimate solution of
                                entire Indonesian question. Although we do not hold that a solution
                                is <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0294"/>certain through
                                conference, it does seem that Dutch suggestion presents real
                                possibilities of ultimate and early settlement. Heretofore all
                                negotiations have been held in poisoned atmosphere of Indonesia and
                                transfer of negotiations to Hague would enable negotiations to
                                proceed in more suitable atmosphere, with presence of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> guaranteeing fair deal for
                                both parties. Despite intransigence on Netherlands side in past,
                                they at least have been willing to conduct negotiations in
                                Indonesia, but, in present case, involving transfer of sovereignty,
                                Netherlands desire to have negotiations here is understandable as it
                                is Netherlands Government that is handing over sovereignty.</p>

                                    effort to hold US firmly to the position taken in the <gloss

                                    implementation powers. We are anxious, therefore, to avoid any

                                    acceptance of the Beel plan or imposition of sanctions. It does
                                    not appear to us necessary to let the matter rest with a
                                    negative reaction to the Beel plan. In our view, emphasis should
                                    remain on pacific settlement. We doubt that consideration of

                                <item>There appears to us to be some value in pursuing the
                                    possibilities indicated in The Hague’s No. 193, February 25,
                                    particularly if this can be done in such a way as to avoid an
                                    appearance of change from the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                    resolution. Has Department considered the possibility that the
                                    commission should give the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                    notice that within a short time it will present recommendations
                                    for a solution of the existing difficulties as required by the
                                    proviso in paragraph 3 of January 28 resolution. Notice of this
                                    intention would greatly help us keep the situation fluid and
                                    avoid efforts to concentrate <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                    attention on the question of sanctions. The framing of these
                                    recommendations by the commission in consultation with the
                                    Dutch, the Republicans and the Federalists would give Cochran an
                                    opportunity to negotiate the marriage of the Beel plan to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution without the US
                                    retreating from the principles in the Council’s resolution.
                                    Early notice of the foregoing course of action might make it
                                    extremely difficult for the Federalists to attend The Hague
                                    conference, despite the refusal of the Republic to do so. The
                                    recommendations themselves would presumably take basic
                                    principles from <hi rend="italic">Renville</hi>, Cochran plan,
                                        <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and the
                                    principles which were agreed between the parties last fall,
                                    together with concessions which the Dutch have recently told
                                    Cochran they are now prepared to make. If the parties could be
                                    brought within reach of agreement on (1) a set of recommended
                                    principles, (2) return of Republic to Jogja, the Republic might
                                    feel sufficient confidence to accept the Dutch invitation to a
                                    roundtable conference at The Hague to negotiate on the basis of
                                    such recommendations. The conclusion in the third sentence of
                                    paragraph 25 of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>’s
                                    report may present a technical objection to this course of
                                    action. We believe the proviso to paragraph 3 of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution means that <gloss

                                    which actually exists regardless of its cause, and not solely if
                                    caused by lack of agreement on structure of interim government.
                                    In other words, if scope of deadlock is across the board, scope
                                    of recommendations should be equally broad.</item>

                                <item>With reference to The Hague’s compromise proposal and the
                                    Department’s favorable comment on this to Cochran, there is one
                                    point which we should like to bring to the Department’s
                                    attention. Paragraph 3 of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                    resolution requires negotiations between the Netherlands and the
                                    Republic on the basis of <hi rend="italic">Renvile</hi>, and
                                    that the interim government be a result. As the Department
                                    knows, the Netherlands made a special effort to eliminate these
                                    provisions from the resolution before its adoption. At a meeting

                                Probably <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> and surely certain

                            <p>Re Jogja, Schuurman said their information indicated Repub favor in
                                former capital has declined, certain elements being sharply critical
                                of manner in which old régime was carried on and of surrender Repub

                                    >Repubs</gloss> return Jogja they might have difficulty
                                regaining influential position and might even move to left in order

                                putting down Communist uprising in September and we had hoped

                                régime thereafter, I admitted Hatta group has suffered in prestige
                                through Netherlands military action and deterioration continuing.
                                Netherlands should give conservative Repub leaders best possible
                                opportunity now appeal effectively to their followers rather than
                                take them directly Hague and consummate agreement which followers
                                would not accept. I deemed entirely impractical Schuurman’s
                                suggestion every one go ahead with Hague conference and place Jogja
                                problem as first item on agenda.</p>
                            <p>Told Schuurman I thought present exploratory talks between

                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> should continue. When he said

                                Batavia and hinted <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> might
                                desire go Bangka, I said we entirely prepared make trip if and when
                                    <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> may desire. I thought
                                initiative should still be left interested parties to problem at
                                this point. I would probably hear from <gloss target="#t_Repubs1"

                                discussions Sukarno ventured suggest possibility establishing Repub
                                Govt in Atjeh, unoccupied north Sumatra, if Jogja impossible.
                                Schuurman said Netherlands would agree to this.<note n="5"

                                Indonesia received by the Security Council on March 1 together with
                                the response by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to the
                                new proposals for a resumption of negotiations made by the
                                Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>The Government of India is aware of the extended efforts of the
                                United States to find a peaceful path through the besetting
                                difficulties of the Indonesian dispute in a role which it did not
                                seek but in which it has endeavored to contribute its utmost,
                                realizing that the prestige of the United Nations is deeply involved
                                in the case. The Government of India has doubtless, indeed, a
                                special insight into these efforts through the agency of its
                                Consular Representatives in Indonesia, between whom and the
                                successive Representatives of the United States on the Committee of
                                Good Offices a most cordial and fruitful relationship has always
                                existed.</p>
                            <p>The Government of India may be assured that the United States
                                Government remains convinced of the fairness of the Security
                                Council’s Resolution of January 28, and, in the absence of a free
                                agreement between the parties upon a solution outside the terms of
                                that Resolution, will fully discharge the obligations imposed upon
                                it by its membership in the United Nations and its position on the
                                Security Council in support of the Resolution. Having subscribed to
                                the principle of collective security, the United States will be
                                guided by the consensus of the Council and in addition it will in
                                this as in other cases contribute what it can to a wise decision by
                                the Council as to its course of action. Clearly, the Council as a
                                whole has the task of achieving a satisfactory solution of the
                                Indonesian dispute and must as a whole bear responsibility <pb
                                    n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0302"/>for the outcome. No warrant
                                would therefore appear to exist for fixing a collective
                                responsibility upon a single nation and certainly the United States
                                Government cannot regard itself as in any such position. World
                                opinion would surely not expect nor desire the United States to take
                                it upon itself to exceed its responsibilities under the Charter and
                                to court justifiable resentment by assuming a unilateral and
                                arbitrary if well-intentioned role.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government will continue to be most receptive to
                                the views of the Government of India on the Indonesian dispute, upon
                                which by reason of geographical and historical factors it is able to
                                throw light, and to welcome information on any particular efforts to
                                bring about a solution which the Government of India for its part
                                may be contemplating.</p>
                            <p>Geographical and historical factors in its own case cause the United
                                States to feel a deep concern in matters which give grounds for
                                possible misunderstanding between the peoples of Asia and those of
                                Western Europe. It is therefore particularly grateful for the
                                expression of the Government of India’s appreciation of the
                                difficulties which it has faced and of the friendly feelings which
                                have prompted the Government of India to make its views available.
                                The United States Government will look to the Government of India
                                for continued friendly understanding, confident that both
                                Governments are striving for the same goal.<note n="3"

                                    is attractive to me. I am of opinion that transfer sovereignty

                                round-table invitation would then be sent by Republicans.

                                    <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Ambassador</hi>, During our
                                    discussions concerning the new proposals of the Netherlands
                                    Government for an accelerated transfer of sovereignty, the
                                    question of the return of the Republican leaders to Djokjakarta
                                    appeared to be the main although not the only difficulty
                                    preventing an acceptance of the plan by the Republic and a
                                    wholehearted support of our proposals by the governments of the
                                    Atlantic nations. I have tried to explain orally to you the
                                    fatal consequences of a return of the Republican Government to
                                    their capital for an effective and lasting solution of the
                                    present difficulties. In case the Republic would definitely and
                                    irrevocably refuse the invitation which has been transmitted to
                                    them, the question of the return of the Republican Government to
                                    Djokjakarta will undoubtedly figure in the report which the
                                        <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> has to make to the
                                    Security Council.</p>
                                <p>I feel very strongly that your Government should have at its
                                    disposal all relevant information concerning this question
                                    before making a final decision. On the other hand I am very
                                    reluctant to give publicity to incriminating evidence concerning
                                    persons with whom we have negotiated in the past and with whom
                                    we are anxious to resume negotiations.</p>
                                <p>After considering this matter I have decided in consultation with
                                    my colleagues to send you for your personal information a short
                                    memorandum on some of the documents found in the archives at
                                    Djokjakarta which illustrate the policy followed by the
                                    Republican Government, in the hope that these documents will
                                    help you to understand the difficulty for the Netherlands
                                    Government to agree to a return of the Republican Government to
                                    Djokjakarta at the present time.</p>
                                <p>Djokjakarta is not only the capital of the Republic: it is also
                                    the source of inspiration for those Republican elements, which
                                    refuse any form of cooperation with the Netherlands and which
                                    will continue guerrilla action no matter what happens.</p>
                                <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0307"/>
                                <p>Although we have not taken any repressive action, we know that
                                    the Republican leaders, who are now in Djokjakarta or vicinity
                                    continue to support subversive elements, who prevent the
                                    restoration of orderly conditions.</p>
                                <p>It has been said that the Republican Government can only order
                                    its adherents to cease guerrilla warfare, when it has been
                                    reestablished in Djokjakarta and has sufficient facilities for
                                    communication. The enclosed documents indicate unmistakably the
                                    use which responsible Republican leaders have made of their
                                    authority and the facilities of Djokjakarta during the period
                                    when the truce agreement was in force. There seems little ground
                                    for the assumption that after their reinstallation in
                                    Djokjakarta they would follow a different course of action. The
                                    public declarations of the Republican emergency government, the
                                    authority of which has been expressly recognized by Mr. Hatta,
                                    that they would continue guerrilla warfare until victory was
                                    achieved only confirm the conclusion of the Netherlands
                                    Government, that a restoration of republican authority in
                                    Djokjakarta would inevitably result in a further deterioration
                                    of the situation, which is already extremely difficult.</p>
                                <p>In sending you the enclosed memorandum I wish to reiterate that
                                    this is not done in a spirit of bitterness or revenge, but only
                                    to enable your government to make a decision on their future
                                    attitude on the basis of a knowledge of the information which is
                                    available on the subject to the Netherlands Government.</p>
                                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                                <p>The paramount question asked in the recently occupied territories
                                    is whether or not orderly conditions will be reestablished.
                                    Indonesians and Chinese, intellectuals and the man in the street
                                    alike, all ask whether the Netherlands troops will remain, or
                                    whether the <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> will return to
                                    resume its reign of terror. The Dutch answer to these questions
                                    is that the Netherlands army will stay as long as it is needed
                                    and that the <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> will not be
                                    allowed to return. The restoration of orderly conditions takes
                                    time. The confidence of the people, that they may resume their
                                    normal activities without fear of oppression or compulsion, can
                                    only be gained gradually.</p>
                                <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0308"/>
                                <p>The confidence of all those who have faith in our promises is
                                    based on the assumption that a restoration of Republican
                                    authority would not be permitted. Any indication to the contrary
                                    would cause those whose confidence is wavering to think twice
                                    before expressing willingness to cooperate, and would create
                                    doubt in the minds of those who have resumed their work as to
                                    whether they have made the right choice. Political and social
                                    reconstruction, for which confidence in Netherlands’ protection
                                    is an indispensable prerequisite, would be slowed down
                                    considerably.</p>
                                <p>Everywhere in Indonesia even far outside Republican territories,
                                    the restoration of Republican authority would be interpreted as
                                    proof that Republican supremacy will ultimately return and in
                                    many federal territories this will create confusion and
                                    dismay.</p>
                                <p>The considerations described above with regard to individuals
                                    apply equally to political organisations. Extremists on the
                                    Republican side would receive encouragement, for they would
                                    rightly come to the conclusion that tenacity is profitable and
                                    this would stiffen them in their attitude.</p>
                                <p>A still more serious fact is, however, that Tan Malakka’s group
                                    would gain by the restoration to an even greater extent, as it
                                    is their avowed purpose to put an end to all Netherlands
                                    influence in Indonesia and to promote Communism. Consequently it
                                    is to be expected that guerilla warfare, in which this group
                                    plays such a prominent party would receive a new impetus. During
                                    recent weeks the military and political situation has improved,
                                    in some regions even considerably, mainly because various bands
                                    see no further use in armed resistance.</p>
                                <p>It is obvious that this guerilla warfare would flare up anew if
                                    Sukarno c.s. were to be vested with governmental authority and
                                    allowed to return to Djokjakarta. Loss of human life would
                                    inevitably result.</p>
                                <p>It cannot be expected that the Republicans would agree to the
                                    presence of Netherlands forces in Djokjakarta, even assuming
                                    that under those circumstances Netherlands forces would be able
                                    or willing to perform their task.</p>
                                <p>A new demarcation line, however short, would revive economic,
                                    financial and traffic chaos. A Republican Government would wish
                                    to set up its own financial and communications systems,
                                    including postal, telegraph and telephone services. This would
                                    artificially complicate the situation and render the future
                                    unity of Indonesia forever impossible.</p>
                                <p>All security would disappear and the same terrorism with which
                                    the Republican Government has been totally unable to cope in the
                                    past, and which it has even encouraged, would prevail. The
                                    Republican <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0309"/>Government
                                    would be completely at the mercy of Extremist groups and thus
                                    unable to continue negotiations.</p>
                                <p>From the situation briefly outlined above it appears that the
                                    Dutch efforts to introduce in the whole of the Indonesian
                                    archipelago a policy aiming at an early transfer of sovereignty
                                    to a federated state would again have to make way for the
                                    divergencies which have so far stood in the way of this
                                    unity.</p>
                                <p>A restoration of Republican authority would inevitably lead to a
                                    dualistic policy. Restoration of the Republican Government at
                                    Djokja—however small its territory may be—would in fact bring
                                    the parties back to their previous position, which for two years
                                    has prevented the conclusion of a real agreement. Even supposing
                                    the Republican Government would be prepared to order the
                                    guerilla bands to cease all fighting, and that these troops
                                    would carry out their orders—both improbable suppositions as the
                                    record shows—the first point of discussion after this cease-fire
                                    would be the consideration of a truce agreement and the
                                    establishment of new demarcation lines etc. In these
                                    circumstances, instead of passing from truce negotiations to
                                    political negotiations, the parties to the dispute would return
                                    to a previous stage which could only delay the final solution.
                                    The Republican army would be reconstituted and the existence of
                                    two opposing armies, both having legal status, would again lead
                                    to armed clashes with fatal consequences for the future of
                                    Indonesia.</p>
                                <p>The Netherlands have reluctantly been obliged to assume in
                                    practice exclusive responsibility for the restoration and
                                    maintenance of peace and order in the whole of Indonesia, and
                                    they cannot renounce this responsibility until a settlement has
                                    been made which provides for political cooperation and
                                    integration of the federal and republican territories under one
                                    government to which the Netherlands can transfer
                                    responsibility.</p>
                                <p>The artificial controversies between republican and other
                                    territories should at last come to an end. These controversies
                                    have been fomented neither by the Netherlands nor by the federal
                                    territories, but only by the Republic. Cooperation of the
                                    population for the common cause cannot be expected until the
                                    people have an assurance that the Republic will not be restored
                                    in its former shape. A restoration of the Republic would force
                                    them again to make their choice.</p>
                                <p>The Netherlands are therefore obliged to continue their efforts
                                    towards the establishment of a central authority, which, in
                                    fact, they would rather entrust to the Indonesians today than
                                    tomorrow. This authority must not again be split in two, as
                                    would be the result of a restoration of Republican authority at
                                    Djokja.</p>
                                <p>The Republican leaders would be welcome in a central Indonesian
                                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0310"/>Government which
                                    would also have authority over the former Republican
                                    territories. They cannot be allowed any longer as a separate
                                    political entity aiming at domination of the whole archipelago,
                                    in the interest of finance and economy, political development,
                                    social welfare, communications and all other common problems.
                                    Integration and not disintegration should prevail. The
                                    recommendation of the Security Council to reestablish the
                                    conditions which created the previous difficulties is
                                    unacceptable to the Netherlands in the interest of Indonesia.
                                    The interests of Indonesia are and should be paramount in all
                                    our decisions.</p>
                                <p>No sinister Dutch interests are being pursued; the Netherlands
                                    are concerned only with the necessity to create a United
                                    Indonesia to which complete sovereignty can be transferred with
                                    confidence.</p>
                                <p>As long as there is no guarantee of a United Indonesia, the
                                    restoration of a separate Republican administration in
                                    Djokjakarta is out of the question. The Netherlands cannot run
                                    the risk of a Republican Government continuing its old
                                    tactics.</p>
                                <p>Experience has taught a lesson which is not easily forgotten.
                                    Even before the political discussions envisaged in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">Renville</hi> Principles began, the Republican
                                    authorities organized subversive activities by means of
                                    radiopropaganda, secret armyorders and infiltration tactics. Few
                                    people believed this at the time, but the documents included in
                                    this survey prove it only too clearly.</p>
                                <p>It should be reiterated here that an all-Indonesian Government
                                    has to be created as soon as possible, but a situation in which
                                    the Central Government has no authority over Djokja cannot be
                                    allowed to arise again.</p>
                                <p>The Republican leaders have now been released and the Netherlands
                                    Government is fully prepared to come to an understanding with
                                    all parties, without attaching undue importance to formalities
                                    and procedure.</p>
                                <p>It is, however, only prepared to transfer its authority over the
                                    whole achipelago, including the Republican territory—and
                                    Djokjakarta—to one federal Indonesian Government.</p>
                                <p>Apart from evidence already published, these conclusions are
                                    borne out completely by the examination of the Republican
                                    archives which have been found after the occupation in Djokja
                                    and elsewhere in Republican territory.</p>

                                    nationalist movement represented by the Republic. The military

                                    had the effect of reinforcing this concept, in addition, it

                                    formula which would permit them to cease hostilities, have
                                    enlarged their demands in the past month and profess to find the
                                    present military situation markedly to their advantage. A pliant

                                    movement.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>For these reasons, the present situation would appear to require in
                                the first place that the Dutch (1) give full freedom to the
                                Republican leaders, (2) afford these leaders a seat of authority to
                                the end that they may have access to the resistance forces in order
                                that the Republican movement may be re-integrated and made
                                answerable to the authority of these leaders, and, (3) elucidate
                                their new proposals to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of
                                the Republican Indonesians that the objective is identical with that
                                of the Security Council’s resolution of January 28—the transfer of
                                full sovereignty within the period laid down in the Security
                                Council’s resolution to an Indonesian government in which the
                                Republic will be guaranteed its due role—even if the means of
                                achieving the objective are somewhat at variance.</p>
                            <p>In any case, the essential requirements of the situation confronting
                                the Dutch would appear to be plain. If these requirements are met,
                                Mr. Cochran could look forward with some hope to prevailing upon the
                                Republican Indonesians to accept the Netherlands proposals. But the
                                task of presenting proposals which offer the basis of a reasonable
                                solution falls primarily upon the Dutch. Mr. Cochran will exert
                                himself to the utmost, as he has in the past, to find a way out of
                                the impasse <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0313"/>which
                                threatens. But he must have something substantial with which to
                                work.</p>
                            <p>A report received on March 4 from Mr. Cochran states that the
                                Republican Government on Bangka Island is disposed to accept the new
                                Netherlands proposals to negotiate at The Hague on the strength of
                                the explanations given by Mr. Koets, acting as emissary of the
                                Government of Indonesia, provided that the United Nations Commission
                                for Indonesia assist at those negotiations under the terms of
                                reference laid down by the Security Council and that the Republican
                                Government be restored to its seat of authority in Jogjakarta in
                                order that it may be in a position to issue a cease-fire order and
                                bring about a peaceful situation. These conditions, which seem
                                reasonable to the United States Government, appear also to have the
                                support of the Federalist Indonesians.</p>
                            <p>Should the Dutch fail to give the required minimum assurances on the
                                points which are obviously critical, it is difficult to see how,
                                through Mr. Cochran’s efforts or by any other means, the Security
                                Council can avoid being faced with a clear case of Netherlands
                                non-compliance with its resolutions, with consequences of the most
                                unwelcome nature, whatever form they take.</p>

                                Netherlands Government was categorically and repeatedly on record as
                                unalterably opposed to restoration Republic at Jogja, and he,
                                speaking as Acting Foreign Minister, would have to say that any

                                before Hague conference must be viewed with greatest pessimism.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out new situation existed as result <gloss target="#t_BFO1"

                                could be assured Republic delegation would leave Batavia for Hague
                                conference of specified date mid-March, he thought bare possibility
                                existed Cabinet might agree to restoration without delay (and might
                                even provide transportation for few days’ visit and consultation
                                Jogja before delegation take off), although might have to disclaim,
                                at same time, responsibility for resultant disorders. Such agreement
                                would have to give absolute assurance Republic attendance Hague
                                conference and would need be worked out between [apparent garble]

                                Lovink admitted March 12 no longer possible but thought March 15
                                feasible start conference. We believe March 15 takeoff Republic

                            <p>Lovink further stated Netherlands Government felt <gloss

                                influence at this time in restraining Republican leaders from making
                                exaggerated and impossible demands as well as by indicating <pb

                            <p>I am convinced as I have indicated before that possibility of
                                successful compromise to enable resumption Indonesian negotiations
                                can be found along above lines, namely, agreement by Republic’s to
                                attend Hague conference in return for Dutch agreement to restoration
                                Jogja; but the two must be linked together. It will be difficult
                                secure Cabinet approval but we note a number of signs that
                                international considerations are slowly making headway over largely
                                national approach hitherto prevailing.</p>

                                repeated to our Embassy at The Hague for transmission to the

                                proposals for a conference at The Hague. However, he was specific in
                                stating that he felt the condition precedent to such negotiations as
                                set by the Republican leaders, namely restoration of the Republican
                                Government at Djocjakarta, was impossible of acceptance by the
                                present Netherlands Government or by any Netherlands Government
                                likely to be formed. He reiterated his view that further pressure on
                                this point from the Security Council would cause the fall of the
                                present Netherlands Government. The Department’s officers answered
                                Mr. Helb’s questions with regard to the telegram of instruction,
                                indicating that if the Netherlands took a position in the Security
                                Council amounting to an inflexible rejection of the proposal for
                                restoration, the U.S. representative could obviously not put forward
                                the point of view contained in <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                                    facs="0317"/>the telegram, but would be forced to revert to
                                support of the Security Council’s resolution of January 28 in its
                                entirety.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the question of restoration, Mr. Helb was informed that
                                according to our information the Federalist organization (<gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss>) had passed a resolution
                                unanimously supporting in principle the Republican demand for
                                restoration to Jogja; that later, according to our information,
                                certain <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> members were influenced
                                by Mr. Beel to change their positions; that it had been our
                                understanding that one of the principal objections of the
                                Netherlands Government to the idea of restoration was based on the
                                belief that it was opposed by the Indonesian Federalists. We pointed
                                out that the acceptance by the Netherlands Government of the
                                proposal re restoration might be greatly eased by their placing face
                                value upon the resolution of the <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                >BFO</gloss>, rather than trying to oppose it. Mr. Helb said that
                                his information differed from ours with respect to the degree of
                                unanimity prevailing among the Federalists; and further stated that,
                                in view of the pressures prevailing from many quarters upon the
                                Indonesians, he saw no reason why Mr. Beel should not have counseled
                                the Federalists with regard to their stand re restoration of the
                                Republic.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Helb then raised the question of the information recently given
                                Foreign Minister Stikker in Paris by Mr. Harriman relative to the
                                Military Assistance Program. He inquired whether the caveat we had
                                entered was timed as a “big stick” to influence the Netherlands’
                                decision re restoration of the Republic, expressing his personal
                                anxiety lest it be so interpreted by the Netherlands Government. He
                                was assured that the timing on this matter was the result of the
                                natural sequence of events in planning the Pact and the Military
                                Assistance Program and that it was not devised as a means of
                                pressure; he was further advised that the information was given to
                                Mr. Stikker in an effort to be entirely forthright, in order to
                                avoid the possibility of misunderstanding at a future date.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Graves called to make available a summary of a telegram from Mr.
                                Bevin to the British Ambassador at Washington relative to a
                                suggestion by the Netherlands Ambassador at London<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d213fn1">Jonkheer E. Michiels van Verduynen.</note> as
                                to the terms on which the Netherlands Government might be willing to
                                agree to the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0318"/>restoration of
                                the Republican Government to Jogjakarta. Mr. Graves related that the
                                Netherlands Ambassador’s views were communicated to Mr. Bevin
                                shortly after Mr. Stikker had been told by Mr. Harriman that <gloss
                                    target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would be implemented so far as the
                                Netherlands was concerned only after there had been a settlement of
                                the Indonesian dispute. Mr. Graves agreed that the communication by
                                Mr. Harriman had evidently shaken the Netherlands Government
                                considerably and he believed that that government now appeared to be
                                somewhat more amenable as regards the restoration of the Republican
                                Government at Jogjakarta than it had been hitherto. Mr. Graves
                                stipulated, however, that the views which the Netherlands Ambassador
                                had communicated to Mr. Bevin were entirely personal and that the
                                Netherlands Ambassador had said that he could not guarantee that the
                                Netherlands Government would agree with and act in accordance with
                                those views.</p>
                            <p>In reading the summary of the above-mentioned telegram it was noted
                                that there was no substantial departure from the suggestions given
                                in last week’s telegram from Mr. Bevin to the British Ambassador,
                                which Mr. Graves had made available on March 3 and which was
                                discussed in our <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of March 4 to
                                the British Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>It would appear the Netherlands Ambassador at London has suggested
                                that the Dutch would be prepared to permit the Republican Government
                                to return to Jogjakarta, but not to re-establish itself as a
                                government of the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi>, if the US
                                and the UK would give certain assurances to the Netherlands

                            <p>I pointed out to Mr. Graves that it would appear from recent
                                communications from Mr. Cochran that the Republicans had already
                                accepted to negotiate at The Hague provided that (1) <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> would assist at The Hague
                                negotiations under the same terms of reference as provided by the
                                Security Council for negotiations at Batavia, and (2) that it be
                                restored as a government to Jogjakarta. I told Mr. Graves the
                                foregoing would appear to dispose of point (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>). I then remarked to Mr. Graves that so far as points (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) were
                                concerned I believed they were substantially the same and further I
                                    <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0319"/>could see no virtue in
                                publicly preferring any plan to the Security Council resolution
                                until the parties to the dispute agreed to negotiate on the basis of
                                that plan; that if they so agreed there could be no great objection
                                raised as to the lack of strict conformity of the Netherlands plan
                                with the Security Council resolution. So far as point (<hi
                                    rend="italic">d</hi>) was concerned decision regarding thereto
                                did not appear to be necessary at this time since it was a
                                development which might or might not materialize and then only in
                                the future.</p>
                            <p>I reiterated to Mr. Graves that, on the whole, the above-mentioned
                                telegram did not appear to depart greatly from the previous telegram
                                and that the Department’s position as regards the suggestions in the
                                previous telegram and as regards similar suggestions in the present
                                telegram was set forth in our <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of
                                March 4. In sum, the United States Government, as a member of the
                                Security Council could not take any action nor could it advocate
                                taking any action which recommended a departure from the Security
                                Council resolution of January 28 unless the parties to the dispute
                                agreed to negotiate under a plan differing from that resolution, and
                                even in the latter case the United States Government would be bound
                                by the majority opinion of the Security Council. I expressed my
                                personal opinion that as the Republicans had apparently agreed to
                                negotiate at the Hague it would appear that the Netherlands
                                Government should make an effort to meet the Republican’s conditions
                                so as to put the parties in a negotiating position as soon as
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Graves explained that his Ambassador had been instructed to seek
                                the views of the Secretary of State on this matter and I said that I
                                would make the foregoing information available to my superiors and
                                that I would inform him of their views at the earliest possible
                                moment.</p>

                                afternoon March 7. He said Jogja trouble March 1 has made The Hague
                                more determined not permit Republican restoration. Criticized
                                Republican reply to round table invitation and suggested Republicans
                                would demand more once they have Jogja.</p>
                            <p>To Critchley and me, Herremans yesterday quoted Beel as saying
                                Indonesians will have to choose between Beel plan and <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution (which Netherlands will
                                not implement) since he is not willing to have any part of latter
                                tied to his plan. Herremans proposed to us idea letting Republican
                                leaders return Jogja with Netherlands troops therein placed at their
                                command or simply return in existing circumstances. We opposed these
                                as I would oppose idea of “visit” mentioned by The Hague <gloss

                            <p>These suggestions miss two main points (1) restoration must be
                                sufficient in scope and bona fide in character to insure Republican
                                leaders most propitious circumstances for appealing to followers
                                cease fire; (2) trying eliminate Jogja restoration or so weakening
                                it that response to leaders appeal will be slight would mean warfare
                                continuing throughout months that may be required in The Hague
                                Conference and ratification.</p>
                            <p>Lovink shows no sense reality in suggesting round table feasible by
                                March 15. If Netherlands might decide today in favor restoration
                                Jogja, my guess is that at least one month required before
                                Indonesians could meet Hague. Simple tasks are not involved in
                                getting Netherlands troops out of Jogja, bringing in and organizing
                                Republican military police, placing Jogja on economic basis
                                sufficient to guarantee existence of population and position
                                Republican leaders, transfer Republican leaders from Bangka to Jogja
                                and calling in collaborators from Java jungle and Sumatra emergency

                                Hague trip.</p>

                                government does intend grant real independence Indonesia. Although

                                Furthermore, when judging Dutch intentions, it is necessary to have

                                chaos and disorder and unduly exaggerate Republican’s ambition for
                                complete dominance ultimate government. Moreover, for considerable
                                period Foreign Office officials told us they had documentation on
                                republican leaders which if not actually incriminating was seriously
                                damaging. Officials said they did not wish publish documents as
                                would inflame Dutch people, aggravate general situation and make it
                                even more difficult deal with Republican leaders in future. However,
                                Stikker felt documents should be released to Ambassadors friendly
                                governments to explain and justify reasons for Dutch reluctance on

                                did not meet with sympathetic consideration. He and other
                                conciliatory elements would have to give way to extremist

                                procedure, etc.</p>
                            <p>Sukarno said some confusion exists following his answer to
                                invitation. Said his letter based solely on invitation as received
                                and as clarified by Gieben and Koets. Said it could not possibly
                                take into consideration published reports of questions answered by
                                Beel at press conference, etc. Said invitation so vague Republicans
                                feel they should not bound by commitments before entering
                                conference. Specifically they take exception to Beel attitude that
                                constitution of two parties Netherlands and Republic must be in
                                conformity with statute union. Republicans realize Netherlands
                                Constitution already amended to envisage union statute. They are
                                willing have general concepts of union statute included in political
                                agreement Insist, however, that under Netherlands plan Republican
                                Constituent Assembly can meet and adopt constitution only after
                                signing agreement for transfer sovereignty including union statute.
                                They want no mention of union statute in Republic constitution but
                                union agreed upon through treaty.</p>
                            <p>While Republicans insist upon as unconditional and early transfer
                                sovereignty as possible, they realize agreement toward this end will
                                involve certain conditions which cannot be fulfilled until after
                                transfer date, such as disposition Netherlands troops, etc.
                                Consequently they argue <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                should remain on scene until sovereignty transfer agreement actually
                                implemented.</p>
                            <p>Republicans hold firm to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution
                                and their rights thereunder. Look upon conference as simply medium
                                for discussing earlier transfer sovereignty than anticipated in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution and for getting
                                lined up for bilateral political agreement with Netherlands under
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> auspices. They hope
                                round table conference will be successful in developing form of
                                agreement along pattern suitable to other Indonesian states and
                                desire exchange views and cooperate toward this end. They will hold
                                out, however, for agreement under <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> auspices.</p>

                                saying guerrillas have let him know they will heed his appeals only
                                when his voice comes from Jogja. Speaking to Sukarno alone
                                afterwards, I advised him await Netherlands decision on Jogja before
                                asking <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> help draw <pb
                                    n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0327"/>in his leaders. I said if
                                and when favorable decision announced, <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> would be glad help assemble everyone. I said he
                                would weaken his own position well as his own arguments in favor
                                restoration Jogja if he made proposed request this time when
                                decision surely imminent.</p>
                            <p>In answer my queries of Sukarno re restoration Jogja, he assured me
                                if Sultan authorized pave way it can be accomplished smoothly. Said
                                if he and Sultan both there and permitted reasonable number civil
                                and military police there will not be any chaos Netherlands predict
                                or even any minor incidents to cause concern. He would expect to
                                issue ceasefire order and accept go round table within possibly one
                                week after return Jogja if this arranged in accordance his idea.
                                Said withdrawal authority delegated emergency government will be
                                prompt and simple. Expects receive support of 90 to 95 percent his
                                old Republican followers if returned Jogja and Republic given fair
                                deal by Netherlands. Among nonconformants he included Tan
                                Malakka.</p>
                            <p>Sukarno assured me he would consider some of his assistants’
                                suggestions only “tertiary” in importance and would not delay
                                conference. I said it would be <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> duty criticize Republic if latter showed any such
                                tendency after Jogja matter adjusted. Sukarno discussed possible
                                Republic representation at round table conference with me. He spoke
                                of sending best men he has. I favored both Sukarno and Hatta going.
                                He said he feared necessary one of them, perhaps himself, remain
                                Jogja to work toward pacification, etc. I said absolutely essential
                                either he or Hatta be at conference at all times, if not
                                simultaneously. He thought he would send Hatta for first three weeks
                                and then perhaps relieve him personally for awhile. I reminded him
                                Netherlands contemplates using entire Cabinet as conference
                                delegation so his representatives should be strong as possible. I
                                mentioned advantage having conference Hague where all Netherlands
                                Cabinet on hand and no necessity representatives refer matters back
                                for consideration.</p>
                            <p>Republicans feel they have made progress with <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> and can work in harmony with them for a nationalist
                                Indonesia if Netherlands do not interfere. To Sukarno I opposed idea
                                advanced by Herremans [that] Sukarno seek see Beel Batavia. I said
                                let matters proceed formally for present. I discouraged Hatta from
                                idea moving residence Republic leaders from Bangka to Atjeh, again
                                saying wait Jogja development since Atjeh arrangement would not be
                                considered substitute for restoration.</p>

                            <p>237. Lovink and Boon in early afternoon, Stikker late afternoon and
                                evening, have stressed repeatedly imperative need of obtaining some
                                assurance on US attitude toward points set out Stikker letter March
                                8 to Bevin, if Netherlands Cabinet were to be induced to agree on
                                “return to Djogja”. Stikker expressed confidence he could secure
                                Cabinet agreement, if he could offer some tangible basis for
                                reversal previous unbending stand, and above all if Dutch military
                                sensibilities and national pride were not inflamed by return of

                                that if <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> could see its way
                                clear to endorse these proposals (Bevin’s general approval of which

                                would at once secure cabinet agreement, and would immediately be
                                able to instruct Van Royen to accept, for Holland, a proposal which
                                he understood McNaughton is ready to offer, or <gloss

                            <p>Stikker was not satisfied with our statement re <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>, namely, that “US had taken no
                                attitude in question” and considered it matter for local agreement;
                                said he could not therefore instruct Van Royen to agree now to
                                McNaughton proposal, if made (as we advised by telephone he would),
                                but rather to state that he must submit it for consideration his
                                government. Van Royen, therefore, would make opening statement
                                reiterating Dutch stand but leaving door open for proposals.

                                believe every consideration has been shown Netherlands Government by

                                that present is time for definite showdown. If Netherlands desires
                                round table “detour”, it should certainly be called upon to meet at
                                once provisions <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution
                                necessary to such detour. At same time should not be excused from

                                visit. I said informal with no significant developments. Summarized
                                by saying Republican leaders insistent on restoration Jogja and
                                genuinely interested in round table idea. Added that I had

                            <p>The Secretary of State is encouraged by the informal proposals
                                contained in the letter of Foreign Minister Stikker to Foreign
                                Minister Bevin on the point of restoration of the Republican
                                Government to Jogjakarta, and sees in these proposals a reasonable
                                basis for discussion in an effort to overcome the obstacles now
                                standing in the way of the proposed conference at The Hague and for
                                a fulfillment of the basic purposes and objectives of the Resolution
                                of the Security Council of January 28, 1949.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State earnestly hopes that preliminary negotiations
                                between the parties with the assistance of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> can promptly go forward with
                                the objective of reaching a solution of the Jogjakarta question and
                                promoting at an early date the initiation of the proposed
                                round-table conference at The Hague.</p>
                            <p>It is the opinion of the Secretary of State that the remarks made by
                                Senator Austin in the Security Council on March 10 point the way for
                                the holding of such a preliminary conference, and that making
                                arrangements therefor should be an immediate task of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>. It is also the hope of this
                                Government that the discussions in the Security Council now going on
                                will enable the Council, through a communication from the President,
                                to advise the <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> in this
                                sense.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the specific conditions (nos. 1 through 9) contained
                                in Mr. Stikker’s letter, this Government considers that it is
                                difficult, if not impossible, at this time and at this distance from
                                the scene, to comment specifically upon their merits. Bearing in
                                mind the main objective of the preliminary conference—namely, the
                                clearing away of obstacles to the conference at The Hague—this
                                Government believes that the most useful role it could play at this
                                juncture would be to instruct its representative on <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> during the preliminary
                                negotiations to make every effort to insure that full consideration
                                be given these points by the Republic with a view to bringing the
                                parties to agreement. This Government also considers that, after
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> has had an opportunity
                                to learn the Republic’s views on these points, it would be
                                appropriate and desirable for <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> to make specific recommendations thereon to both
                                parties.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of restoring the Republican Government to Jogjakarta is
                                to enable it to reassert its authority over Republican elements, to
                                    <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0333"/>enable it to take
                                decisions as a government and, in cooperation with the Netherlands,
                                to bring about a peaceful situation in Indonesia. This Government is
                                confident that the representatives of the Netherlands and of the
                                Republic can agree upon conditions which are fair and feasible and
                                will make the holding of The Hague round-table conference
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>In view of the forthright approach to the problem taken by Mr.
                                Stikker, which is most gratifying to this Government, the Secretary
                                of State has confidence that the possible issues in such preliminary
                                negotiations between the parties will be handled by the Netherlands
                                authorities with requisite flexibility; and in this assurance, this
                                Government is confident that the issues can be resolved and the main
                                objective of a successful conference at The Hague be achieved.</p>

                            <p>First paragraph Stikker letter-gives well-known arguments in
                                justification military action which <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> has condemned.</p>
                            <p>Paragraph 2 argues against sound concept <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution namely that restoration Jogja necessary
                                to enable Republicans issue most effective call to guerrillas. There
                                is calculated risk of disorder which believe must be taken in view
                                other important considerations. Seriously doubt Republicans, if
                                permitted return to small area Jogja, would launch campaign
                                victimization while surrounded on all sides by Netherlands military
                                forces with planes, bombs, etc.</p>
                            <p>Paragraph 3, if Netherlands Government genuinely contemplates
                                turnover sovereignty in few months, cannot believe such last ditch
                                opposition should arise against real restoration, to say nothing of
                                “token return”.</p>
                            <p>Paragraph 4, while naturally favor cooperation, think <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should resent Netherlands effort
                                avoid any <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> [debate?] or
                                suspicion their compliance with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution.</p>
                            <p>Point 1, Republican Government cannot exercise appropriate functions
                                in full freedom including administration Jogja area, if Netherlands
                                authorities remain responsible for law and order therein. Clashes
                                would appear inevitable, even if Republicans agreed to such
                                arrangement, which I consider unlikely.</p>
                            <p>Point 2, convinced cease-fire order issued by Republicans when not
                                functioning freely and in position authority would have poor
                                response.</p>
                            <p>Point 3, law and order not being well maintained in Jogja now
                                with</p>
                            <p>Point 4, Netherlands would interfere with progressive withdrawal of
                                Netherlands forces anticipated under <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> resolution and delay any action thereon until
                                agreement at round table.</p>
                            <p>Point 5, no comment. This already anticipated by paragraph 4(D)
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.</p>
                            <p>Point 6, by military action Netherlands has already disrupted
                                economic, financial, and social structure Indonesia. Restoration
                                Jogja, accordance <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution,
                                would be first orderly step toward reconstruction and under eyes
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> anxious see best
                                results achieved.</p>
                            <p>Point 7, Republican leaders have already assured <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> representatives informally
                                that when restored Jogja will call emergency government members
                                Jogja and revoke all delegated authorities.</p>
                            <p>Point 8, <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> has military
                                observer Jogja and would plan augment number considerably even to
                                using entire force if necessary to observe turnover to an
                                administration under Republicans. Civilian members could also be
                                stationed there or visit frequently as circumstances warrant.</p>
                            <p>Point 9, Netherlands token restoration cannot be taken seriously if
                                accompanied by demand that immediately after return of Republican
                                Government to Jogja, delegation for round table will leave for
                                Hague, such delegation to include Sukarno and Hatta. This would give
                                no time for bringing in and consulting scattered leaders by
                                Republican Government. Furthermore, would necessitate absence
                                Sukarno at time when his efforts might best be devoted to
                                pacification. I favor one of two top men being at Hague constantly,
                                and Sukarno agreed thereto (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1">Gocus</gloss>
                                624) but I share his idea re advantage of his being principally
                                Jogja. Bevin has expanded some above arguments.</p>
                            <p>As for remainder letter, “sweeping proposals” of Netherlands
                                Government which to date have been so vague as to arouse little
                                enthusiasm will cause Netherlands Government to be suspected
                                launching colossal swindle if they insist stubbornly on holding out
                                against <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution on point Jogja
                                restoration, while giving no undertakings. I have gone along with
                                round table idea, since I feel we could at Hague have best chance
                                either force Netherlands give honorable deal or be shown up in true
                                light, and dealt with accordingly. If Drees Government not strong
                                enough weather Jogja, could surely never get transfer sovereignty
                                agreement ratified. Arguments in regard to Netherlands effort create
                                stability in Indonesia with 100,000 soldiers for over three years,
                                patently <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0336"/>fallacious. Unfair
                                Netherlands approach US and UK Governments separately, seeking
                                concessions under <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution in
                                which both governments have participated. Inclined doubt moral value
                                Netherlands in group of Atlantic friends, if inclined use
                                friendships to escape compliance with judgment of majority Western
                                powers and entire east.</p>
                            <p>In summary, I consider Stikker’s approach weak and unconvincing.
                                While willing compromise on means when motives beyond question, in
                                light foregoing, must recommend strictest insistence upon prompt

                                he was able secure cabinet approval for agreement to McNaughton
                                proposal which had great virtue from Dutch viewpoint of being
                                couched general terms permitting discussion all conditions,
                                including restoration to Djocja, which agreement essential for

                                reference to Djocja and detailed spelling out of proposals and
                                obligations, would go down extremely badly in cabinet and generally
                                in Holland and he frankly feared that cabinet would balk and there
                                would be another impasse. This would be deplorable. In his view,
                                McNaughton proposal, which Holland had accepted, would in practice
                                enable conference to cover exactly same ground as American
                                draft.</p>

                                stated, to encourage McNaughton to formulate his own proposal to
                                council, following as closely as possible language agreed to by Van
                                Royen.</p>
                            <p>Position here as we view it is that Netherlands Government and
                                Parliament are in process of backing down from position hitherto
                                stubbornly maintained toward Djocja. It would seem important make it
                                possible for them change their position without too much loss of
                                face and still carry public opinion with them; otherwise they will
                                do so if at all with bad grace and might even refuse, with further
                                prolongation this dangerous crisis which, unfortunately, many Dutch
                                officials and public figures associate more and more with problems
                                Western Europe, including Atlantic pact. Stikker particularly
                                stressed this to me while at same time expressing his own
                                wholehearted support and espousal of spirit, principles and mutual
                                material advantages of pact.</p>

                                you would be able to see me to-day in view of the latest
                                developments in Lake Success and, as a result, in Holland, with
                                regard to the Indonesian question.</p>
                            <p>In reply to my inquiry I learned that your time will be taken up with
                                Congressional hearings, and that you suggest a talk on Monday. This,
                                I assume, means that on Saturday too there will be no chance of
                                seeing you. I therefore shall be very glad to come on Monday, but I
                                am anxious to write to you without delay since I do not feel
                                justified in withholding until Monday from you my realization of the
                                fact that a situation is developing in Holland which gives cause for

                            <p>You know that in regard to Indonesia the question is not whether that
                                archipelago is to be free and independent. That question is answered
                                in the affirmative, most especially in Holland. Nor is the question
                                when it is to be free and independent: the reply is, so far as we
                                are concerned: if possible in a few months time, well before the end
                                of the year, months before the date suggested by the Security

                                    rend="italic">how</hi> can this best be brought about?</p>
                            <p>The United Nations Security Council, in a resolution of January 28,
                                called upon the Netherlands in order that the Government of the
                                republic of Indonesia (one of several Indonesian States to be
                                federated in the United States of Indonesia, and the only one with
                                which there are difficulties) be returned to its capital city of
                                Djokjakarta with full powers of administration. I may mention in
                                passing that the republic has made this return a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >condition</hi> for fresh negotiations, thereby going farther
                                than the Security Council’s resolution.</p>
                            <p>If the Republican Government is reinstated in its capital without
                                qualification, it is certain that those elements, now in hiding,
                                will return with the government of the republic to its capital who
                                have previously prevented that government from coming to terms with
                                my Government. They are: communist leaders who, though ardent
                                communists, do not (or do not openly) admit allegiance to Moscow,
                                and secondly heads of armed organizations whose power depends on the
                                perpetuation of unsettled conditions.</p>
                            <p>It is for that reason that, as honest people, we felt, and feel, that
                                we cannot take upon ouselves to carry out that part of the Security
                                Council’s resolution without some reasonable qualification. If we
                                took another attitude, we would be untrue to ourselves and to the
                                Council, for <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0340"/>against our
                                better knowledge we would do something which we are convinced in our
                                heart and conscience would be a sure way of preventing agreement
                                from being reached. No republican government, if subjected again to
                                the dual influence I have just mentioned, could afford for reasons
                                of its own personal safety to come to an agreement with us on <hi
                                    rend="italic">any</hi> terms.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has done his best to find a
                                compromise. He suggested to your Government and to the United
                                Kingdom’s Government that, if they could support him he would
                                sponsor the return of the republican government to Djokjakarta <hi
                                    rend="italic">as a government</hi>, with full civil
                                administrative authority, it being understood—in order to prevent
                                the simultaneous return of the frustrating elements above referred
                                to—that we would undertake to police that city and surrounding
                                district. The United Nations Commission for Indonesia could be our
                                witness that we would let the republican government administer
                                Djokjakarta and environs, and deliberate, communicate and consult in
                                full freedom, as called upon by the Security Council’s
                                resolution.</p>
                            <p>You know what reply you and the British Government returned to this
                                suggestion. I am anxious to bring this matter further, and therefore
                                refrain from comment on that reply. But I am anxious to make a few
                                observations on what happened after that reply was made on March
                                12.</p>
                            <p>On March 11 the Canadian Representative in the Security Council,
                                stressing the desirability for the Council of doing everything
                                possible to aid the parties to enter upon direct negotiations,
                                stated that it would seem useful that the United Nations Commission
                                for Indonesia would assist in reaching an agreement between the
                                parties as to the time and conditions under which the proposed
                                conference at The Hague would be held. He added that “it would be
                                understood, of course, that these exploratory discussions under the
                                ‘auspices of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia would be
                                without prejudice to the resolutions of the Security Council and to
                                the rights, claims or positions of the parties” (page 37–40, United
                                Nations Document <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss>V417).</p>
                            <p>This, although not ideal, seemed to us a reasonable idea and the
                                Netherlands Representative in the Security Council, on behalf of the
                                Netherlands Government, officially accepted the Canadian proposal in
                                the terms and with the objective as formulated by the Canadian
                                Representative. We fully understand that the authority of the
                                Security Council has to be duly taken into account, and that
                                therefore it is difficult to deviate from its resolutions very much,
                                although in the Kashmir and Palestine cases such deviations from the
                                Council’s resolutions were more than once accepted with a view of
                                achieving agreement between <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0341"
                                />the parties. But we also think that if, owing to an insufficient
                                appreciation of the facts as they are on the spot, the literal text
                                of the Council’s, resolution of January 28 went a little too far,
                                this should be corrected in carrying out the resolution. This the
                                Canadian draft takes into account, and in a spirit of compromise (we
                                have made express reservations with regard to the original Council
                                resolution of January 28) we were, and are, prepared to accept it.
                                It semed to us better than the suggestions made by the Chinese
                                Delegate in his speech in the Security Council on March 11, which in
                                our view were more in the nature of admitting the return of the
                                republican government to Djokjakarta without sufficient
                                qualification.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian draft seemed to have very good chances of being
                                accepted, and its acceptance seemed assured if the United States
                                Delegation would accept it. To our great regret, and without
                                understanding the necessity for it, we then heard in spite thereof
                                that the United States Delegation had made a different tentative
                                draft. This draft, as we have it, reads as follows:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is the sense of the Security Council that the United Nations
                                    Commission for Indonesia, without prejudicing the Council’s
                                    resolution of January 28 and the rights, claims and position of
                                    the parties, should assist the parties in reaching agreement as
                                    to the time and conditions for holding the proposed Conference
                                    at The Hague, including the manner in which the restoration of
                                    Djokjakarta to the administration of the Government of the
                                    Republic may be accomplished, to the end that the negotiations
                                    contemplated by the resolution of January 28 may be held as soon
                                    as possible. It is further the sense of the Council that, if
                                    such an agreement is reached, the holding of such a Conference
                                    and the participation by the United Nations Commission for
                                    Indonesia in accordance with its terms of reference would be
                                    consistent with the basic purposes and objectives of the
                                    Council’s resolution of January 28, 1949, which remains in full
                                    force and effect.”</p>

                            <p>We fail to see why it was necessary to draft this text, even in a
                                tentative form, a draft which we are convinced would, if adopted,
                                make agreement between the parties impossible, because it neither
                                adds nor implies a qualification to the return of the republican
                                government to its capital (see above), and, without any necessity,
                                stresses the “full force” of the Council’s resolution of January 28.
                                That is the essential difference with the Canadian proposal, which,
                                whilst entirely compatible with the Security Council’s resolution of
                                January 28, makes it possible to implement that resolution in such a
                                way that ultimate agreement between the parties is not
                                endangered.</p>
                            <p>This raises a crucial domestic issue in Holland, where the nation is
                                getting restive because it is felt the Government’s attempts at
                                reasonable compromise are not duly acknowledged abroad. The Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs, who hopes to meet you here on April 4, has
                                asked me <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0342"/>to invite your
                                serious attention to this situation, which may—there is no point in
                                hiding it—lead to his early resignation, and perhaps to that of the
                                whole cabinet. Dr. Baruch, who is on the spot, will be able to
                                explain to you what that would mean.</p>
                            <p>I must admit in all candor that I do not see what can be gained by an
                                attempt to exact from the Netherlands a too literal application of
                                the resolution of January 28. The loss is certain: no agreement in
                                Indonesia. On the most difficult point of that resolution (the
                                return of the republican government to Djokjakarta), Mr. Stikker has
                                explained in his personal letter to Mr. Bevin with which you are
                                familiar, that this problem could find a practical solution, it
                                being understood that the republican government would thereupon take
                                part in the proposed Round Table Conference. This general idea you
                                too seemed to favor in your letter of March 12. Your Government and
                                the United Kingdom Government know that, if and when the parties
                                shortly meet in conference, the Netherlands will not be found
                                unreasonable. If the United States Government considers the
                                Netherlands as a nation which abides by its promises, then it is
                                very difficult to understand why the United States Delegation in
                                Lake Success should believe that it is incumbent on it to present a
                                text stipulating expressly that the unqualified re-instatement of
                                the republican government in Djokjakarta is the aim and purpose of
                                the contemplated conference, and reiterates, again expressly, that
                                the Security Council’s resolution of January 28 remains in full
                                force.</p>
                            <p>Quite apart from their importance and effect in Indonesia, such
                                useless reiterations have an effect on the States-General and on
                                public opinion in Holland which I feel I must call to your earnest
                                attention. It is an effect of exasperation. At a moment when
                                Argentina, France, and the United Kingdom would no doubt accept
                                Canada’s text if only the United States would accept it—and China
                                and Norway then would accept likewise—they see that the United
                                States refuse, and, being unable to find any reasonable explanation
                                for this refusal, they believe that it is in order to side with the
                                Indonesian republic and against the other, non-republican
                                Indonesians and the Netherlands themselves. It is felt that on our
                                side so many concessions have already been made without there
                                becoming apparent any appreciation by others for our accommodating
                                attitude. In order to gain a generally workable solution, we have
                                agreed to continue recognizing the republican government as a party
                                to the dispute as before; notwithstanding the serious doubts as to
                                the competence of the Council to deal with the Indonesian question
                                and the refusal of the Council to submit this important point to the
                                Court of International Justice for its advice, we have announced our
                                willingness to carry out the resolution of <pb n="329"
                                    xml:id="pg_329" facs="0343"/>January 28, to the extent to which
                                it is compatible with the responsibility of the Netherlands
                                Government; we have decided to transfer sovereignty to the United
                                States of Indonesia a full year earlier than foreseen by the
                                resolution; we have thereby reduced the interim period and the
                                necessity for arrangements for an interim-government to a minimum;
                                and so there are more concessions which I will not enumerate fully
                                in this letter.</p>
                            <p>But this is not a process which can be continued indefinitely; the
                                line obviously has to be drawn at the point where a further
                                concession (such as the unqualified application of the Security
                                Council’s resolution of January 28) would endanger if not nullify
                                the chances of ultimate agreement between the parties. That point,
                                it is felt in Holland, has now been reached, and the exasperation of
                                which I spoke springs from lack of support abroad of this reality
                                after we have shown our goodwill by a series of concessions on major
                                points, our suggestion for a Round Table Conference and our desire
                                to set up the United States of Indonesia a year earlier than the
                                Security Council itself had envisaged. The Dutch people is naturally
                                patient, but its patience has its limit somewhere, and that limit is
                                now visible. It is not, as I said, drawn by either whim or caprice,
                                but by cogent consideration of being unwilling to make concessions
                                which endanger or nullify the chances of ultimate agreement.</p>
                            <p>There is a strong feeling amongst the people in Holland that at the
                                moment there does not exist that real confidence between our nations
                                which must be present if the Atlantic Pact is to be a success.
                                Irrespective of what this or any Government in Holland would wish or
                                prefer, this feeling is reaching a degree of intensity which is such
                                that it may discharge itself, so The Hague assures me, in some
                                irrational way. If next Monday, March 21, American influence in the
                                Security Council results in the adoption of a decision which as
                                honest people we cannot accept, knowing that subversive influences
                                will make it impossible for the republic to come to terms, Mr.
                                Stikker wishes you to know that this may well result in an open
                                rupture between ourselves and the Security Council, and this when
                                the margin is so small, and when it is difficult to see what general
                                or Western interest should prevent adoption of the Canadian
                                compromise. Mr. Stikker furthermore fears that public opinion would
                                then strongly oppose Netherlands participation a few days later, in
                                the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact, however much he and the other
                                members of the Cabinet would desire this participation.</p>
                            <p>For these reasons, Mr. Stikker has directed me to submit these
                                considerations to you long enough before Monday (when the Security
                                Council’s decision is expected) so that you can decide what
                                instructions <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0344"/>to give to the
                                United States Delegation in the Security Council, and to express to
                                you his very earnest hope that by accepting the Canadian compromise
                                the United States Government will not go farther against our
                                reasonable attitude than other Governments who are to join us in the
                                Atlantic Pact, Governments who have that confidence in our sincere
                                intentions with regard to Indonesia which the Canadian proposal
                                presupposes and to which my nation feels entitled.</p>
                            <p>I venture to express the hope that on Monday you will find it
                                possible to authorize me to tell my Government that your Delegation
                                in the Security Council will support the Canadian proposal.</p>
                            <p>Believe me to remain with high regard</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                                <item>I have just talked on the telephone with Van Royen, returning
                                    his call. Van Royen referred to a suggestion I made to him on
                                    Thursday afternoon that the best way out of this difficulty
                                    would be for Van Royen, on behalf of his Government, to state
                                    Dutch acceptance of the revised formula. Van Royen said with
                                    reference to this statement that he had been in touch with his
                                    Government which was being “difficult” about his making such a
                                    statement.</item>

                                <item>Van Royen said that he felt the holding of the preliminary
                                    conference at Batavia was the essential thing; it would be a
                                    pity, therefore, if this conference could not be held merely
                                    because we found ourselves unable to agree on a formula. He
                                    hoped, therefore, to be able to get together with me before the
                                    meeting to see what we could do. I told him I would be available
                                    either after twelve o’clock or at 2:45 before the Council
                                    meeting at Lake Success. (It was clear to me in the context of
                                    my conversation with Van Royen that he is waiting to find out
                                    the line which the Secretary of State takes with Van Kleffens
                                    this morning.)</item>

                                <item>Van Royen said on the basis of a telephone conversation with
                                    Stikker yesterday he is worried about the situation of the Dutch
                                    Government. He said their position is “hardening”. He added this
                                    may be only a psychological factor but as such it may well lead
                                    to the Dutch Government resigning.</item>

                                Council might send to the United Nations Commission for Indonesia as
                                the sense of the Council on the way in which we should proceed on
                                the Indonesian case.<note n="2" xml:id="d233fn2">

                                </note> This suggestion will be made by the Canadian and it is
                                expected that the President of the Council would adopt this
                                statement without the use of a formal resolution. Senator Austin
                                expects to say very briefly that we believe this is a useful way to
                                proceed and seems to represent the sense of the Council.</p>
                            <p>So far as we now know, the only Dutch objection to this text is that
                                they would like to substitute “terms and conditions for” in place of
                                “the manner in which” under (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in the
                                attached statement. That change might in fact be made in New York,
                                but I understand that many members of the Council seem to object to
                                it at this stage.</p>
                            <p>You will also be interested in the report that Mr. Chauvel, French
                                Representative on the Security Council, recommended to the French
                                Government that they urge the Dutch to accept the view of the
                                Council on the Djog Jakarta point and that Chauvel has been informed
                                that the French Ambassador in The Hague has been so instructed.</p>

                                this afternoon when Cuban President, Alvarez, following speech by
                                Palar (Indonesia) passed word to McNaughton he could no longer

                                had been agreed upon by McNaughton in accordance Cuban suggestions
                                before meeting began (text statement McNaughton had intended to

                                    <item>Based on Palar charges (which so far as we know

                                        Djogjakarta, Cubans want insert in formula some reference
                                        this charge. We took view <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                        should not take account such charges from one of parties in

                                            >UNCFI</gloss> would have reported if charges valid.
                                        Cubans will probably yield on this point, but have asked us
                                        we inform them any information we have received from

                                        to bring parties together to talk about two points: namely,

                                of sponsors January 28 resolution to agree final formulation. We
                                agreed might be good idea. Any guidance Department can give us

                            <p>4. Egyptians with somewhat same emotional reaction also apparently
                                became unhooked but we do not yet have motivation.</p>
                            <p>5. Fact of shift Cuban and Egyptian attitudes in favor much tougher
                                approach against Dutch should be conclusive proof to latter our

                                We have some doubt they will understand this. Van Roijen in

                                meeting expressed view that had US expressed support original
                                Canadian suggestion as accepted by Dutch, majority of Council would
                                have gone along. He regretted that US delegation, despite original
                                reactions Department and others to Stikker line, had taken tougher
                                attitude, thus forcing others to follow. Ross observed he could not
                                accept this view, reiterated US effort had been to find middle
                                ground between parties and at same time acceptable to <gloss

                            <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0348"/>
                            <p>“In the first place, I wish to make it clear that the suggestion
                                embodied in the Canadian statement on 11 March was put forward in
                                the hope that it might represent a practicable course of action
                                leading to the resumption of direct negotiations between the
                                parties. In advancing the suggestion for exploratory discussions, I
                                put forward an idea, not the final text of a proposal. I fully
                                recognize that the text of any final proposal could not
                                appropriately be drafted until we had the benefit of the discussions
                                in the Council to indicate a consensus of the Council’s opinion.</p>
                            <p>“In the two meetings which have been held since I made my statement,
                                the debate has revealed that the suggestion, as it was originally
                                advanced on Friday, 11 March, has secured the support of a number of
                                delegations; on the other hand, there are some representatives who,
                                while expressing general support for the idea of preliminary
                                discussions, under the auspices of our Commission, have urged that
                                the first and foremost subject for consideration at any such
                                preliminary discussions must be the terms and conditions on which
                                the restoration of Jogjakarta to the administration of the
                                Government of the Republic of Indonesia might be accomplished. I as
                                I understand these representatives, their position is, that once
                                agreement has been obtained on this matter, such preliminary
                                discussions would then turn to the further question of examining the
                                time and conditions under which there could be acceptance of the
                                very welcome initiative of the Government of The Netherlands in
                                proposing a conference at The Hague, which would include
                                representatives of all parties to the Indonesian dispute including,
                                of course, qualified representatives of the Government of the
                                Republic of Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>“I believe that no real difference exists on this point which might
                                prevent the Council from reaching a consensus of opinion. Indeed,
                                the principal object of my remarks on 11 March was to suggest a
                                procedure by which our Commission in Indonesia would be able to take
                                the initiative in an endeavor to remove the present obstacles which
                                exist to the attendance of Republican Representatives at The Hague
                                Conference. Clearly the chief obstacle to the attendance of these
                                representatives is the question of the return of the Government of
                                the Republic to Jogjakarta and the reestablishment of the Republican
                                Government as an effective administration.</p>

                                Netherlands on Wednesday, 16 March, when, in referring to the
                                Chinese and Canadian statements, he said ‘we realize that the

                                Indonesia raised some questions with regard to the proposal made in
                                my statement of 11 March. I hope that what I have said today will
                                have served to dispel any misconception which might have arisen at

                                absolutely necessary. Before this Council could sanction the

                                settlement would result. It would clearly be necessary also that The

                                mutually agreed as to the respective conditions or stipulations, on
                                which they felt they could need assurance, before The Hague
                                Conference could assemble.</p>
                            <p>“It is clear to the Canadian Delegation, and I hope other members of
                                the Council will agree, that it would be impracticable for the

                                These are questions which, in our opinion, should be worked out in

                                another question with regard to the statement of the Canadian
                                Representative on 11 March, when he suggested that our proposal was
                                founded on the mistaken impression that the aims of The Netherlands
                                Government, as set forth in its proposal of 26 February, are
                                identical with the aims of the Security Council and of the Republic
                                of Indonesia. The distinguished Representative of The Netherlands
                                has already twice replied to this question regarding the ultimate
                                objective of Netherlands’ policy on the transfer of sovereignty. On
                                14 March he declared ‘I would now like to state most emphatically
                                that the transfer, according to the Agreement of <hi rend="italic"

                                how this objective is to be attained, the place to clarify the
                                matter is in the conference between the two parties which, as a
                                result of the preliminary discussions we have proposed, we hope may
                                take place subsequently at The Hague.</p>

                                        should be done about Palar’s charges that Dutch [army?] has

                                    <item>I reiterated US continued to support <gloss
                                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution 28 January and
                                        stated that there was general agreement next step should be
                                        to get both parties together in proposed discussions
                                        Batavia. I said I felt best formula presented thus far was
                                        that which McNaughton had intended to present at <gloss
                                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting yesterday. Therefore,
                                        it seemed to me we should stick to this formula and avoid
                                        raising the ante for either side. McNaughton, Shone, Tsiang
                                        and Sunde supported this view. Discussion made perfectly
                                        clear all present agreed restoration to Jogjakarta should
                                        take place before Hague conference.</item>

                                conference would, in his opinion, be unacceptable to Cabinet, and
                                would, he believed, not result therefore in preliminary Batavia
                                discussions; anticipated also that he and Prime Minister would
                                possibly find themselves under necessity, withdraw from Cabinet if
                                latter was forced to take decision re definite <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action in language now proposed.
                                That, he intimated, would be most unfortunate and embarrassing if it
                                should happen while he was en route or in Washington in reference
                                Atlantic Pact.</p>
                            <p>I expressed to him in all frankness, the great mistake I felt
                                Netherlands Government would make if it should quibble and refuse to
                                accept proposal which, in my opinion, fully comprehended and covered
                                Netherlands objectives, and, in fact, did not go beyond what
                                Netherlands had indicated readiness to accept. Stikker replied it
                                was matter of form and not substance, but that form was of utmost
                                importance at present time as indicated <gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                                    >Embtel</gloss> 256, March 17.</p>
                            <p>It is my opinion that Stikker is not well man, is much overwrought
                                and exaggerates opposition. Department will note from Embassy

                                Mr. Helb’s reaction to the telegram was that it might constitute an
                                acceptable basis for proceeding with the preliminary discussions in
                                Batavia, but that this was still contingent upon the Netherlands
                                Cabinet’s reaction. He stated that Senator Austin’s remarks were
                                helpful, but wished that they might have gone further in support of
                                the “Beel plan”.</p>
                            <p>I replied that I trusted that the Netherlands Government would regard
                                the telegram of instructions to <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> and the remarks of Senator Austin in the light in
                                which they were designed—namely, to help overcome a difficult
                                political situation in the Netherlands in a manner which would not
                                prejudice the interests of either party and <pb n="340"

                            <p>Mr. Helb then told me the following:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) That his government had decided to
                                    send Mr. van Royen to Batavia to head the Netherlands’
                                    delegation there; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) That his government
                                    would be powerless to commence negotiations on the subject of
                                    restoration prior to Mr. Stikker’s return from Washington, after
                                    having seen the Secretary and having consulted with his Cabinet
                                    colleagues. Mr. Helb stated that Mr. van Royen expected to
                                    return to The Hague with Mr. Stikker in early April, there to
                                    help persuade the “Cabinet to implement the Security Council
                                    proposal, before proceeding to Batavia.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>I expressed grave concern at the delay involved in this procedure,
                                stressing not only the predictable adverse reaction in the Security
                                Council, but the equally predictable adverse reaction in U.S. public
                                and Congressional opinion. I said that in my opinion what was needed
                                was some immediate tangible evidence of movement, that is, of
                                progress toward implementation of the Security Council’s position
                                which would be evidence of the desire of the parties to reach
                                agreement. I said I felt that otherwise <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> would be compelled during the interim to issue a
                                report of no progress. I suggested that perhaps Mr. van Royen might
                                proceed immediately to Batavia, with the idea in view of arranging a
                                preliminary caucus of Republican leaders, if they so desired,
                                providing safe passage, transportation, etc., to a central meeting
                                point, in order that the Republicans might be placed in a position
                                to move forward in the preliminary negotiations at Batavia
                                immediately upon their commencement. I also mentioned the fact that
                                the longer the delay, the more difficult became the achievement of
                                the real purpose of restoration—namely, the reestablishment of the
                                authority of the Republican leaders over their adherents.</p>
                            <p>White admitting the awkwardness of the delay, Mr. Helb stuck doggedly
                                to the contention that the Netherlands Government was powerless to
                                move until after Stikker’s return from Washington. He requested
                                specifically that Mr. Cochran be advised of the reasons for delay,
                                in order that he might keep things on an even keel in <gloss

                                approved yesterday for transmission to <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> is a compromise formula and is interpreted
                                differently by different delegates in the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> who supported it. The interpretation, we have placed
                                and are placing on it in discussion here is set forth below. <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> is clearly going to have
                                considerable difficulty in getting the parties and the members of
                                the Commission itself to agree on an appropriate interpretation. It
                                would, in our view, be advisable for the Department to inform
                                Cochran of the interpretation which <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                    >USUN</gloss> has been and is placing on this language. We feel
                                this interpretation is a middle ground which, if accepted by the
                                Commission, would be best adapted to avoid difficulties and
                                recriminations and obtain the support of the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> in case the issue has to be referred back as a
                                result of deadlocked negotiations. Our gloss on the telegram is as
                                follows: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The purpose of a telegram rather than a resolution is to

                            <p>In talks with Republicans Tuesday night Republicans stressed

                                and Tan Malakka. Lacy emphasized danger Communism, however labeled,
                                and sharp cleavage throughout world between Communist and

                            <p>At Netherlands–American luncheon Lacy told Schuurman how serious
                                Netherlands situation is and how relatively inflexible US position
                                had become since <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.
                                Gieben told Cochran working on much material for Hague Conference
                                and would be ready with Supomo to fit on negotiations where they
                                ceased at Kaliurang under Stikker. Gieben believed progress could be
                                achieved quickly. Also hoped Djuanda would participate at Hague.</p>
                            <p>When Lacy and Cochran received by Beel, Lacy repeated statement made
                                Schuurman re seriousness Netherlands situation and American
                                adherence to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution, whatever
                                its exegesis; compromise char acter January 28 resolution touched
                                upon and essential difficulty of further compromise emphasized. Lacy
                                explained how concerned US is over Netherlands situation with so
                                many important international developments, Atlantic Pact, et cetera,
                                and his hope Netherlands would move forward constructively soonest.
                                Lacy told of US support for idea accelerated transfer sovereignty
                                offer. Lacy supported Cochran’s contention that compliance with
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution in [<hi
                                    rend="italic">on?</hi>] Jogja immediately necessary. Both
                                strongly favored Hague Conference but emphasized surmounting Jogja
                                impasse requisite to Republican agreement thereto and to placing
                                Republic in position essential to issuance effective cease-fire
                                order. Cochran had told Netherlands seriousness Republican demands
                                on Jogja after first visit Bangka. Federalists now backing
                                Republicans on this point. Cochran and Lacy stressed need push
                                forward while Beel emphasized difficulty for him carry out
                                resolution. Both appreciated this but Lacy referred to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and US condemnation police action and
                                Congress and press tiring of US bleeding for Netherlands over
                                Indonesia which US cannot indefinitely afford. Cochran stressed his
                                efforts and confidence in getting Republicans properly lined up for
                                Hague once Jogja agreed to. No promise came from Beel or Schuurman
                                although reception US views serious and amiable.</p>
                            <p>At Schuurman dinner Van Hoogstraten said Jogja restoration
                                impossible; hoped his government would never yield; Netherlands knew
                                their problem and knew their solution right; worst had been passed
                                in Indonesia and some improvement being recorded. Cochran said
                                police action had been condemned and <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> Resolution had required certain performances
                                including restoration Jogja. Hoogstraten said military action
                                correct and returning Republican Government Jogja would be like
                                turning a state over to Hitler. Cochran said he was confusing
                                parties in his comparison. Hoogstraten said Americans interfering.
                                Cochran said US only one party to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Resolution. Hoogstraten still blamed Americans; voiced defiance
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, saying even economic
                                sanctions would not change Netherlands attitude.</p>
                            <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0359"/>
                            <p>Hoogstraten said Republican leaders should ask Netherlands Government
                                spell out Beel plan and then go Hague without mentioning Jogja.
                                Cochran said if Netherlands Government sincere they would adumbrate
                                program without request. Cochran stressed need for stopping
                                hostilities. Hoogstraten said old Republican leaders have lost out.
                                Said Batavia Republicans would not return Jogja and presumed
                                attribute such statement second-hand to Darmasetiawan. Cochran
                                retorted he had talked Darmasetiawan and four other leading
                                Republicans previous evening and had been impressed their fidelity
                                Republican leaders and insistence on Jogja move. Cochran said <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> had sounded out Sultan and
                                other leaders Jogja and had been informed restoration entirely
                                feasible. Cochran admitted calculated risk in restoration but
                                thought this must be taken. Hamid told Cochran in presence
                                Netherlands officials thought restoration Republic to Jogja
                                essential. Said Federalists and Republicans could get together
                                easily with <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> helping and
                                quick solution would be possible if Netherlands overcame inferiority
                                complex and rectified past mistakes. Hamid said giving explanation
                                to press on <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> Resolution March 3.
                                This appeared Aneta March 24.</p>
                            <p>At Schuurman dinner Lacy spoke strongly to Spoor and Schuurman,
                                recapitulating US view folly police action, serious position
                                Netherlands in community of nations and importance to Netherlands of
                                paying small price restoration Jogja to attain immediate objective
                                Hague Conference.</p>
                            <p>Thursday forenoon at Bangka Cochran gave story <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> deputies’ visit Jogja and also
                                of progress Lake Success on revision Canadian statement. Wednesday’s
                                decision <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> not known at Bangka
                                during visit. When question of extent of territory to be restored
                                arose, Cochran insisted on text <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                resolution (i.e. Jogja and environs only) but with understanding
                                progressive withdrawal might be achieved later. Lacy and Cochran
                                argued against Republicans quibbling over chairmanship Hague
                                Conference. Stressed importance changing venue to Hague with
                                conference taking place in western capital with <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> present and embassies of world
                                powers observing. Republicans endorsed heartily Lacy’s ideas that
                                agreement on statute union should be voluntary.</p>
                            <p>In conversations with Republicans as with Netherlands officials Lacy
                                stressed seriousness of Communist danger and need for unanimity in
                                opposition thereto; thought workable and beneficial relationship
                                between Republicans and Netherlands still attainable and absolutely
                                essential as bridge between east and west. Lacy dilated grim results
                                east-west split, tragic position Indonesia should it choose course
                                inimical to policies democratic states rest of world which policies
                                US prepared to effect strongest positive defense. Sukarno and
                                company <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0360"/>exhibited
                                enthusiastic agreement these views and seemed acutely aware
                                Communist danger in Indonesia and determined to cope therewith
                                immediately and with strong measures as soon as in practical
                                position. Sukarno angered by Communist attacks on him and Republican
                                Government; impressed by decision Norway, which Lacy described, for
                                whose socialist government has great respect.</p>

                                and contemplated issuing invitations to both parties to meet with us
                                some time next week. Desired inform Netherlands delegation of this
                                decision before issuing invitation to Repub Government send
                                delegation Batavia. Schuurman said he would consult Beel. He called
                                back to state Beel approved Batavia as meeting place but invitation
                                to Netherlands delegation would have to be referred Hague. Schuurman
                                said no decision likely thereon before Cabinet meeting 28th.
                                Consequently it might not be possible Netherlands to meet date if
                                fixed early.</p>
                            <p>Leimena, Natsir, Supomo and Sudjono visited me Friday 7 p. m. I told
                                them of Lacy and my visit with Repub leaders Bangka. I let them know

                                received prior our departure from Batavia for Bangka and we had only
                                seen sketchy press reports thereon at Singapore. I expressed my

                                would help make whatever arrangements <gloss target="#t_Repubs1"
                                    >Repubs</gloss> desire and Netherlands approves. I urged however
                                that Repub leaders Bangka must take responsibility for attending
                                Batavia meeting and must not allege unable take such decisions as
                                would be required at that meeting without prior restoration Jogja. I
                                said meeting Batavia is necessary before there can be any

                                        restricted solely to Jogja restoration. My idea is that we
                                        should press Netherlands at reasonably early date make
                                        definite commitment on Jogja. We could refer paragraph 2
                                            <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> report March 1
                                        wherein we said Netherlands must comply with certain

                                        responsibilities. Furthermore, we could support position
                                        adhered to by Republicans that they cannot be in position to
                                        function as government until restored Jogja. By this line we
                                        might endeavor consummate arrangements for return to Jogja
                                        and actually accomplish restoration while meetings in
                                        session. Other points in operative paragraphs 1 and 2 <gloss

                                    <item>I anticipate Republicans will stand by expressed
                                        determination not to accept formally Hague invitation until
                                        returned Jogja and government functioning. I think effort of
                                        Netherlands Delegation to tie up restoration Jogja to
                                        condition of prior acceptance Hague invitation would lead to
                                        impasse. Believe this may be kernel as to whether we can
                                        make progress here. If proper atmosphere can be developed so
                                        Republicans can give Netherlands informal assurances of type
                                        Bangka leaders gave me, difficulty might be overcome.</item>

                            <p>I stressed hope both parties accept invitation unconditionally

                                participates, as may Republicans through necessity consult scattered
                                leaders and delegation members. Insisted Republicans would be making
                                no commitments by accepting invitation and that no binding
                                agreements could be expected before government restored Jogja.</p>
                            <p>I thought <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> directive gave broad
                                field for implementing resolution which stands unchanged. Thought
                                both parties should strive cooperate fully in agreeable atmosphere.

                                into discussions at appropriate stage. Herremans endorsed my views
                                almost 100 percent.</p>
                            <p>Republicans asked our help in bringing Ministers Djuanda

                            <p>Hatta talked alone with me half hour. I gave usual argument favoring
                                    <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0366"/>early acceptance

                                restoration Jogja and cease-fire order.</p>
                            <p>Hatta had just received letters from wife and friends Jogja reporting
                                economic situation there worsening and leftist influence
                                strengthening. Also had messages from <gloss target="#t_TNI1"
                                    >TNI</gloss> forces Pasundan re concern of military over failure
                                leaders get successful negotiations started, et cetera.</p>
                            <p>Hatta admitted complete personal readiness follow my ideas. Said he
                                must move cautiously, however, not to lose confidence of supporters
                                through what might be considered weakness in agreeing negotiation
                                with Netherlands at Batavia on implementation <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                                Malakka and others will attack him bitterly thereon. Roem and some
                                other Republicans emphasizing this to Hatta, abetted, I believe, by
                                    <gloss target="#t_AusDel1">AusDel</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>I hoped Van Royen coming might mean possibility-sufficient
                                statesmanship being displayed to permit some informal and
                                gentlemen’s agreements Batavia which might be ratified later when
                                Jogja restored.</p>
                            <p>I urged Hatta send strong delegation Batavia and attend personally if
                                possible; He is opposed at present to participating personally.
                                Hatta, well as several other Republicans, skeptical about drawing
                                    <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss>’s into discussion at early
                                stage or at all. This comes from fear Mansoer group might block
                                progress and cause much trouble since <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> rules require their decisions be unanimous. I asked
                                he take no definite position yet but wait and see if <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> participation may not later become
                                advisable.</p>
                            <p>I told Hatta Netherlands press and Catholic Party leaders weakening
                                somewhat toward Republicans and latter should move forward in quick
                                and reasonable manner. I asked they let Hague Conference be
                                Netherlands responsibility. I said <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> does not desire Hague meeting be under its
                                auspices. Hatta said <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> shared
                                Republicans’ objection to Netherlands Minister being permanent
                                chairman. Both prefer rotation.</p>
                            <p>I offered help Hatta in his desire establish contact with emergency
                                government Sumatra through arrangements I made in Singapore. He had
                                received messages I had brought via Sjahrir. Several Republicans
                                commented on today’s Aneta report of 1600 Netherlands reinforcements
                                sailing from Holland for Indonesia. Think this not indicative

                                    Netherlands Government would appreciate Van Royen’s

                            <p>I have believed that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution
                                January 28 represented, and in fact still represents, well-advised
                                program but recognize that continued delay and Netherlands attitude
                                toward moderate Republican leaders result hi steady deterioration
                                their position together with probable increasing ineffectiveness

                            <p>As Department well knows, I have always given Stikker credit for
                                highest motives. I realized difficulties with which he has to
                                contend. Cables from Hague and Department reports on conversations
                                with Netherlands Embassy Washington tend to cause doubt, however, as
                                to whether there is genuine intention backed by adequate character
                                and strength in Netherlands Government to carry through promised

                                Department should impress upon Stikker that <gloss

                                agreement. It might refer Stikker to second paragraph <gloss

                                    <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> affair would prove factor
                                to defeat <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in toto, in view
                                uncertainty passage at best. Re Stikker point that Pact might not
                                seem attractive to Neth without <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>,
                                Sec stated that US regards Pact as of great value whether or not
                                    <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is enacted; that we consider
                                commitment US under Pact in itself very substantial commitment.</p>
                            <p>Neth Amb said Neth Govt and people could understand US attaching
                                conditions to ERP and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, if such
                                reasonable and applied generally to all participants. For example,
                                he mentioned withholding financial aid from country against which
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> had voted sanctions, and
                                withholding mil supplies from countries which violated commitment to
                                retain such supplies for defense in Western Europe. Sec replied US
                                criteria would surely not be whimsical, but that we faced here not
                                with question of prin but with question hard political facts. Said

                                negotiate settlement. Suggested Van Royen should proceed Batavia
                                just as promptly as possible.</p>

                            <p>Sec replied that what is necessary is prompt initiation discussions

                                then fail come to agreement. Spaak feels such statement from US

                                ad infinitum.</p>

                                    conversation between your Commission and our party in
                                    Pangkalpinang on March 28 and beg inform you that it has been
                                    decided to accept your invitation to discussions in Djakarta
                                    under auspices of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>.
                                    Since it has not been possible to begin these discussions on
                                    Wednesday March 30 as you originally suggested, I presume you
                                    will let me know at your earliest convenience the proposed date
                                    for opening of talks.</p>
                                <p>My acceptance of Commission’s invitation to discussions with
                                    Netherlands, before latter has agreed to establishment of
                                    Republican Government at Djocja, is likely to create grave
                                    misunderstandings among Republican leaders in other parts of
                                    country and abroad and among Indonesian people generally. Such
                                    misunderstandings could not fail to make eventual settlement of
                                    Indonesian dispute more difficult, I would, therefore, stress,
                                    that my participation must necessarily be limited at least in
                                    early stages of discussions.</p>
                                <p>On 19 December 1948 authority was properly transferred to an
                                    emergency government in Sumatra to act on behalf of Republican
                                    Government until such time as that government is free to
                                    reassemble. As your Commission made clear in paragraph two of
                                    its report to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> of 1 March and
                                    as was emphasized by a number of speakers in recent <gloss
                                        target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>’s debates, restoration or
                                    Republican Government at Djocja free to take decisions uncoerced
                                    is a prerequisite to ‘any fruitful negotiations.</p>
                                <p>I shall, therefore, only be able to discuss initially practical

                                practical statesmanship. However, one point must be clear. Stikker’s
                                letter to Bevin provides Netherlands forces remain Jogja and have
                                last word on law and order. Am convinced Republicans will not accept
                                this condition; if they did, their government would appear a facade
                                and they would lose support. Accordingly, key to possible agreement
                                Batavia is whether Netherlands willing withdraw army from Jogja as
                                anticipated <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution January 28.

                                Stikker assented and interposed no reservation at this point

                            <p>Stikker indicated he anticipated no difficulty about affording <gloss

                            <p>Stikker clearly understands our view that removal of Jogja impasse is

                            <p>Secy then came back to what he called “heart of the matter,” namely,

                                that Repub mil police must be permitted to supplement available

                                might play in this arrangement. In view of your suggestion that

                                coerce Repub Govt itself. Stikker had in earlier talks reflected
                                great sensitivity on this point. Stikker appeared to find acceptable
                                idea that full security responsibility Jogja area wld be in Repub
                                hands, that civil and mil police be subject to Repub orders, that
                                Dutch forces be withdrawn from jogja and immed environs, that Dutch
                                would have freedom of passage through Jogja under proper <gloss

                                and “Repub armies” can be handled by you since neither term can be
                                applied in ordinary western meaning.</p>
                            <p>Secy indicated general nature of points which you believed might be

                                    >Repubs</gloss> and made clear that we believe such points
                                should be sought through informal understandings and not through
                                exact advance undertakings. Stikker indicated particular interest in
                                including Hatta in Batavia talks as soon as possible since he
                                doubted attitude of Roem would contribute to possibility
                                settlement.</p>

                            <p>At end conversation Stikker agreed with Secy that matter must be
                                settled and that it was adversely affecting almost every important
                                problem in Europe. Stikker stated he did not wish to inflict upon
                                Secy any disagreement between Stikker and Nethgov, therefore he wld
                                not make specific commitments to Secy on points covered in
                                conversation. It was clear that Stikker was trying to find a way
                                out. He recalled his earlier view that he and Hatta could settle
                                this matter if the two could get together without hampering instrs.
                                He also indicated that he had told Van Roijen that Stikker would be
                                available to come to Batavia if necessary to prevent breakdown in
                                negots.</p>

                                Nevertheless, we very much hope that you will find Van Roijen in
                                mood and with instrs which will open way for settlement. If so, we

                                emphasized to Stikker that your influence with <gloss

                                Stikker had accurately understood Secretary except re matter listed

                                Republicans until full implementation re restoration Djocja. This
                                had immediately encountered strenuous objection in Cabinet as had
                                also the understanding that US proposed <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"

                                indicated confidentially upon which Cabinet had any real
                                reservations or objections.</p>

                                meant full binding agreement thereon but did not include full
                                implementation as well, prior to discussion and possible agreement
                                on other issues. Otherwise, Batavia meetings might be indefinitely
                                prolonged. Blom, himself, felt this only possible interpretation of
                                language point 7 and said that it would greatly ease for Dutch
                                reaching of early agreement they so much desired. He added
                                Netherlands preferred reach agreement all three points Batavia

                                promptly. He did not exclude possibility, however, Dutch might agree
                                public announcement when agreement reached re Djocja and steps
                                initiated toward implementation provided it also agreed and

                                Netherlands could not accept arrangement under which Netherlands

                                therefore objectionable. However, Blom seemed feel this problem
                                probably could be worked out if recognized that Netherlands forces

                            <p>Sultan called for one hour this forenoon. Came Batavia primarily on
                                plans for restoration Jogja and is consulting Republican leaders
                                including former police officials Jogja thereon. Confident
                                restoration entirely feasible if Netherlands will cooperate,
                                particularly in providing light auto equipment and arms for civil
                                and auxiliary police. Sultan said Netherlands officials have made no
                                headway in establishing own civil government and Republican civil
                                government practically intact. Said number civil police insufficient

                            <p>Sultan ridiculed extravagant measures taken by Netherlands military
                                to surround him by tanks and heavy armor when traveling from Palace
                                to Jogja airport in military observers jeep. Said Netherlands
                                exaggerating danger to himself and to Hatta, Sukarno and other
                                Republican leaders from Communists or other opponents. Said

                                with younger men. Said he had communication from new head Communist
                                Politburo Jogja indicating Communists would not oppose negotiations.
                                Sultan said with population Jogja reduced approximately 50 percent
                                since police action food situation now fairly satisfactory and
                                functioning of restored government would be simple if Netherlands
                                will provide reasonable transportation, fuel, food and clothing. Has
                                developed his plan in considerable detail. Believes he could have

                                week after evacuation by Netherlands military. Stressed urgency
                                getting agreement and restoration Jogja soonest. Thereafter, he
                                said, simple to bring in Republican Military Commander Sudirman and
                                staff and also emergency government leaders from Sumatra. Once this
                                accomplished, authoritative decisions on cease-fire, round table
                                invitation, et cetera, could be taken. Sultan anticipates conferring
                                with Roem 13th and returning Jogja 14th. Would be available come
                                Batavia any time required for conference or particularly

                                present. Hatta stressed importance to Republic cause of success or

                                which arrangement I hope will prevent any initial clash. Van Royen
                                especially pleased that Sjahrir and Sultan drawn into meetings. I
                                explained Sultan returning Jogja tomorrow but he would be available
                                and I would send plane for him whenever required for consultation on

                                carried following UP item heading Batavia: “Roem, chairman <gloss
                                    target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss>, on eve resumption
                                Republic–Netherlands negotiations under <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> told correspondent of UP: ‘I have little optimism
                                over preliminary conference which opens tomorrow, but we must
                                continue all efforts to reach peaceful settlement. My recent
                                experience, however, has not given me much hope. The problem is
                                simple, we want restoration Republic’ He further said Republic
                                cannot make binding decisions on cease-fire or attendance Hague
                                Conference until Government of Republic restored.”</p>
                            <p>Aneta also carried following from Batavia: “Evan [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Van</hi>] Royen, chairman <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"
                                    >NethDel</gloss>, indicated unless Republic enters into talks
                                unconditionally, these fresh negotiations will only lead to failure.
                                He said, ‘idea that Republic Government must first be restored Jogja
                                as preliminary condition to conference is out of question’. He
                                further said, ‘I do not see why one should be pessimistic about
                                Conference’. He pointed out that ruling of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> must be considered as whole and that when
                                Republicans assume there is only one point on agenda this may cause
                                difficulties”.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen phoned me 9:00 a. m. stating Roem received UP correspondent
                                11:00 last night and gave out story which might seriously hurt
                                chances success discussions. When Netherlands authorities saw
                                outgoing UP cable, they called in UP correspondent to whom Van Royen
                                explained his position. I reminded Van Royen that matter of
                                publicity was to be discussed at, conclusion opening meeting today.
                                I told him I had cautioned <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1"
                                    >RepDel</gloss> through Sudjono yesterday as I had likewise
                                cautioned Van Royen against giving any press statements prior
                                opening meeting which might embitter atmosphere or any information
                                re proceedings of meetings except in manner to be agreed upon at

                                delegation arid outlined rules procedure. I quoted <gloss

                                and obtained approval Austr[al]ian and Belgian colleagues to 17
                                questions suggesting points for discussion on restoration Jogja.
                                Submitted these informally to Van Royen and Roem.</p>
                            <p>Visited British Consul General and brought him to date on
                                discussions. He said Van Royen had called and told him surprised and
                                pleased with good atmosphere first meeting. Said Van Royen expressed
                                concern lest restoration Jogja would lower morale Netherlands
                                military forces and have bad press reaction in Netherlands. Consul
                                General said he replied his press summaries from Hague Embassy
                                indicated Netherlands being prepared for this and added that
                                military would just have to accommodate themselves to situation.
                                Consul General thought he should impress upon Republicans
                                reasonableness of Van Royen and get Republicans concede where
                                possible. I replied that although good progress made initially
                                success depends largely on Van Royen being able and willing accept
                                something less than strict “binding agreements” from Republicans in
                                present conversations. I said I was constantly endeavoring make
                                Republicans reasonable but would appreciate Consul General’s support
                                in letting Van Royen realize how much depends on one point
                                mentioned.</p>

                                on these points following today’s meeting. I told them they should
                                seek this stage restoration Jogja and immediate environs only. I
                                said implementation paragraph 4 (F) could follow in due course but
                                that complications and extensive arrangements should not be brought
                                up now which would inevitably delay Batavia decisions and any
                                restoration Jogja. I thought they would be well advised look to
                                Netherlands for reasonable facilities enable Republic Government
                                function Jogja and immediate environs rather than attempt early
                                control over more extensive area and handling economic and security
                                factors connected therewith. I told Van Royen that if these points
                                come to discussion in subsequent <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> meeting I would take foregoing position.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen was to meet Roem 5:30 this afternoon alone. I suggested he
                                make his position clear on above points and let Roem know that too
                                ambitious initial program for restoration beyond Jogja would be
                                impossible of acceptance by Netherlands and would only bog down
                                conversations if Republic insists thereon. I suggested Van Royen go
                                far as possible in informal conversations with Republicans today and
                                tomorrow toward giving them undertaking on general lines which could
                                be accepted as assurance Jogja would be restored and on setting up
                                preparatory commission. I realized he would desire tie in other two
                                points of cease fire and Hague invitation but warned him again not
                                to exaggerate binding character of commitment which he would
                                require. He said if Republicans would show good faith and intentions
                                he was hopeful some formula could be reached and Batavia meeting
                                will succeed. I told him several Republicans had expressed genuine
                                appreciation his approach to whole question and had confidence in
                                him.</p>

                                Friday night and Roem pleased with idea. I recommended we arrange
                                Roem and assistants visit Bangka thereafter. I said if progress made
                                on formula above mentioned, I would see word got to Hatta that he
                                consider most sympathetically coming Batavia next week. Van Royen
                                said he would be delighted if Hatta would come even if he might
                                leave Roem in charge <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> and
                                be available himself only for behind scene consultation. I let Van

                                approach to question much as possible and <pb n="377"

                                Batavia. Van Royen said if Hatta would come for even few days he
                                would endeavor obtain approval his group for him return visit to
                                Hatta at Bangka and perhaps then arrange Hatta come Batavia for

                                meeting held this forenoon Van Hoogstraten’s office between half
                                dozen representatives each from Netherlands and Republic
                                delegations. Agreed <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss>
                                should meet alone this afternoon and let Van Royen know whether they
                                desire further informal conversations tomorrow or formal meeting
                                scheduled for 4 o’clock. Van Royen said considerable progress made
                                in morning’s meeting. He opposed idea any reference this stage to
                                paragraph 4(F) <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution January
                                28. Said only initial step of restoration Jogja and immediate
                                environs should be discussed now. Republicans said they motivated by
                                two principal reasons in including reference to 4 (F) working
                                paper.</p>
                            <p>First they thought necessary get commitment from <gloss
                                    target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> now that initial Jogja
                                restoration would be only first step in giving back all pre-December
                                19 area to Republic. They were concerned in this connection lest
                                followers would question existence constituency for government and
                                would be uncertain as to Republic proportional representation in
                                envisaged constitutional assembly. Van Royen assured them
                                Netherlands still had in mind giving proportion of one-third to
                                republic and this would not be affected by limited restoration
                                Jogja. Secondly Republicans feared Netherlands might proceed with
                                setting up new <hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_negara1">negara</gloss>s</hi> from former
                                Republic territory unless commitment now made on restoration and
                                implementation thereof started shortly after city Jogja restored.
                                Van Royen promised consult colleagues on this point and felt he
                                could give necessary assurances.</p>
                            <p>For initial restoration Republicans presented map showing area
                                extending approximately 5 kilometers outside perimeter city Jogja
                                but including Maguwo airport and Kaliurang. Van Royen Said
                                impossible yield Maguwo since it would be essential continuing
                                Netherlands air service to Maguwo and technical staffs would have to
                                be retained there for despatch aircraft, etc. Pointed out
                                Republicans had no commercial aircraft and would be dependent on
                                Netherlands services for transportation, supplies, etc. As for
                                Kaliurang, Van Royen still considering this with colleagues
                                including military advisors. He admitted to Republicans desirability
                                letting Kaliurang be available for residence Republican officials
                                and possibly for <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> and other
                                representatives connected with restoration Jogja and conferences
                                thereon. Republicans had presented argument Jogja water supply is at
                                Kaliurang. To me Van Royen said principal concern comes from
                                Netherlands military who fear Kaliurang might be place of contact
                                for Republic military with subversive elements in mountain area back
                                of town. I suggested rules could be established to diminish this
                                danger and we might make Kaliurang headquarters for number military
                                observers who could be useful this direction. Van Royen and
                                Republicans exchanged <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0394"/>views
                                over difficulties administration area outside Jogja that normally
                                depends on that center.</p>
                            <p>Republicans spoke of difficulty giving binding commitments Batavia on
                                cease fire and Hague invitation. Said did not want government
                                meetings restored Jogja have appearance rubber stamp concerns. Van
                                Royen said Republicans should consult many as possible leaders now.
                                Thought formula could be worked out by Republicans which could put
                                Netherlands minds at rest on two points in question without too
                                strict commitment being required. Willing make Hague conference
                                easier for Republicans by stressing <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> assistance therein but made no commitment to
                                Republicans that phrase “under <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> auspices” would be used.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen especially gratified by attitude Djuanda who desires no
                                roadblocks or lines of demarcation and minimum impediments to
                                intercourse between restored Jogja and rest of Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>Leimena raised question roundtable agenda. Van Royen replied
                                preferable not anticipate roundtable conference entirely by going
                                over Batavia everything to be discussed there but willing go far as
                                practicable in letting Republicans and <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> know what to expect. Leimena inquired whatever
                                scheduled could be promised by Netherlands as to time required for
                                Hague Conference and for Netherlands ratification agreement reached.
                                Van Royen held it impossible give definite dates but willing promise
                                in official meeting that effort would be made to end conference
                                within 6 weeks and secure ratification within similar period.</p>

                                letting them join <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                discussions. I reminded Van Royen <gloss target="#t_BFO1"

                                and I thought only good could come from further contact between two
                                Indonesian groups. He in turn expressed desire they hasten toward
                                constituting Indonesian front. I told him Anak Agung spoke to me at

                                Sukarno from me. I had told him I hoped Hatta would come Batavia
                                next week at least for visit. Van Royen pleased I had said this.
                                Anak Agung seeing him tonight but Van Royen prefers no request to
                                Hatta come from himself. I told him Roem seeing me later. He said
                                his delegation approved his idea returning call on Hatta Bangka if
                                Hatta would make initial visit Batavia. He granted my request for
                                permission convey this message to Hatta through Roem.</p>

                                territory and Govt Jogja would have responsibility for coordinating

                                is to enable Repub Govt issue ceasefire order and accept Hague

                                under Repub Govt direction. I said <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"

                            <p>They brought up their fear of Repub not receiving proportionate
                                representation of one-third and of <hi rend="italic">

                                former Repub territory before round-table agreement reached. With
                                information provided by Van Royen to me (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1"
                                    >Gocus</gloss> 665), I gave them what assurances I could on
                                these points and reminded them again continuing status and validity
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> told me Van Royen could
                                give partial answer Thursday to working paper. I suggested they have
                                formal meeting to receive such information. I anticipate Van Royen
                                might be able continue response at formal meeting Friday. If this
                                proves impossible, he recommended Roem and Van Royen with possibly
                                their two deputies meet informally to avoid any impasse developing.
                                I took this position since <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss>
                                particularly unhappy over attitude demonstrated by Hoogstraten and
                                Koets in Wednesday’s session. They said these two of Palace group
                                followed old-time tactics which have defeated <gloss
                                    target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> in past. They have confidence
                                in Van Royen but dubious whether policy will eventually depend on
                                him or be dictated by Beel group.</p>
                            <p>I reminded <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> I had originally
                                recommended Hatta head <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss>.
                                I said Roem had done spendidly and I hoped he would continue head
                                    <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss>. I thought it would
                                be most helpful however if Hatta could come Batavia to have direct
                                contact with Van Royen and decide to what extent and in what form
                                assurances can be given latter on cease-fire and Hague invitation. I
                                said arrangement on these two points must develop before Van Royen
                                can finalize undertaking on rest Jogja. They agreed their
                                delegations should petition Hatta come Batavia and one or both of
                                them go Bangka Saturday and endeavor bring him back with them
                                Sunday. I told them I authorized by Van <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
                                    facs="0397"/>Royen let Hatta know through them that if he called
                                Batavia Van Royen would be willing accept Hatta invitation Bangka.
                                    <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> agreeably surprised
                                and promised help work out this arrangement. I suggested Hatta call
                                first on arrival Batavia but if any obstacle to this I would take
                                responsibility get Hatta and Van Royen together. Signed Cochran.</p>

                                    comments on various points of <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1"
                                        >RepDel</gloss>’s working paper dated 16 April.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> therefore intends
                                    bring forward at later date other points in connection with a
                                    possible return of Republican Government to Jogja.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 2. Obviously Netherlands military authorities as consequence
                                    of conditions prevailing Jogja had to impose certain
                                    restrictions and take certain measures to maintain law and
                                    order.</p>
                                <p>Insofar as material and information to be collected is needed in
                                    connection with possible return of Republican Government to
                                    Jogja and its immediate environs, it would seem advisable to
                                    entrust this task to Joint Commission referred to in comments on
                                    point 8.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 3. Netherlands Government is prepared agree to return of
                                    Republican Government to Jogja provided a binding commitment is
                                    obtained on the two other subjects, namely, firstly, ‘that
                                    Republican Government shall order its armed adherents to cease
                                    guerrilla warfare and cooperate in restoration peace and
                                    maintenance law and order’ and, secondly, ‘to make agreements
                                    concerning time and conditions for holding of round-table
                                    conference at Hague’.</p>
                                <p>With regard this point <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"
                                        >NethDel</gloss> takes view that if and when return of
                                    Republican Government to Jogja and its immediate environs takes
                                        <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0398"/>place, this will be
                                    effectuated on basis paragraph two of operative part <gloss

                                    the ruling of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> of 23 March

                                <p>Ad. 4 and 5. A counterproposal as to area to be transferred under

                                    Republican Government will be submitted as soon as possible.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 6. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> is of opinion
                                    that local cease-fire order, effective only for area Jogja and
                                    immediate environs, would not be sufficient and might even
                                    create impression that Republican Government is condoning—if
                                    only temporarily—continuation guerrilla warfare outside said
                                    area.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 7. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> shares opinion
                                    that preliminary period of approximately two weeks will be
                                    required before actual transfer effected.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 8. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> agrees to
                                    establishment of Joint Commission as envisaged by Republican
                                    working paper. It would seem preferable, however, to call this
                                    commission a joint commission of investigation and advice.</p>
                                <p>One of tasks to be entrusted to this commission could be to
                                    advise on question of return of vital officials now outside city
                                    whose services will be required.</p>

                                    <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> has no objection in
                                    principle to return of such officials.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 9. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> welcomes
                                    suggestion that all affairs connected with preparations and
                                    execution of transfer will be coordinated in such manner that
                                    one high official will be fully empowered to act on behalf of
                                    Government of Republic in this regard.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 10. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> has no
                                    remarks to offer on this point.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 11. As already stated by its chairman, <gloss
                                        target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> feels that important
                                    factor which cannot be ignored when making estimate as to ‘total
                                    number of civil and perhaps auxiliary police that would be
                                    required for Jogja and immediate environs’ is undoubtedly figure
                                    of number of civil police employed in city Jogja immediately
                                    prior to December 19, 1948. Figure of 1200 for police force to
                                    be employed in city Jogja and its immediate environs would seem
                                    somewhat excessive.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 12 and 13. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> must
                                    reserve its position until it is informed in further detail with
                                    regard these points and point 11.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 14. <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> readily
                                    agrees that arrangements will have to be made for normal supply
                                    of food, textiles, medicines and fuel.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 15. As stated by Dr. Van Royen on April 19, <gloss
                                        target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> feels that if at all
                                    possible, there should be no road blocks nor should there be
                                    restoration of demarcation lines of which those road blocks
                                    would be symptomatic.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> considers it
                                    eminently desirable that traffic between city Jogja and
                                    surrounding country should not be hampered by a blockade on
                                    either side. However, if Republican Government deems it
                                    necessary to establish control of firearms carried or
                                    transported by individuals entering area Jogja, Netherlands
                                    authorities with view to cooperate in maintenance law and order
                                    in this area are willing assist in such control.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 16. For reasons mentioned above (Ad. 15), <gloss
                                        target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> has no objection to
                                    first sentence this point.</p>
                                <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0399"/>
                                <p>Re second and third sentences, <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"
                                        >NethDel</gloss> suggests that a preliminary survey be made
                                    by Joint Commission referred to Ad. 8.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 17. In interest of free traffic and of unity of monetary
                                    system of Indonesia, <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss>
                                    feels that reissuing of <gloss target="#t_URI1">URI</gloss> by
                                    Republican Government would create almost unsuperable
                                    difficulties. Further discussions on this point seem therefore
                                    indicated.</p>
                                <p>It may be noted that printing plant at Jogja previously used by
                                    Republican Government has been returned to owners (Kolff and
                                    Company, Batavia). Arrangements concerning further use of this
                                    plant to be made by Republican Government would have to take
                                    this fact into account.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 18. Reference may be made to <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"
                                        >NethDel</gloss>’s comments on point 8.</p>

                                    further detail.</p>
                                <p>Ad. 20. As stated by its chairman on April 19, <gloss
                                        target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> is of opinion that
                                    railways and other means communication through Jogja and
                                    immediate environs should continue to function as part of
                                    Indonesian system of communications as a whole. This system
                                    should not be split in two separately organized entities as
                                    consequence of return of Republican Government to Jogja.”</p>

                                paper, chairman Critchley remarked to me aside he thought this

                                his assistant Van Schelle meet Hatta with me. Through Darmasetiawan,
                                I offered make any arrangements Hatta might desire.</p>
                            <p>At 8:30 this evening visited Hatta for one hour his request. Told him
                                reasons why his other friends and I thought his presence Batavia
                                essential, praised Roem’s performance to date and suggested he

                                Van Royen’s approach sincere and helpful and I convinced he desires
                                reach fair settlement soonest; pictured embarrassment for everyone

                                argued virtue having amicable negotiated settlement rather than one
                                dicated by <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>; opposed idea

                                on restoration to Netherlands delegates; expressed confidence that
                                Hatta and Van Royen would get on well together and achieve success

                                deterioration situation. Said difficulties center principally on

                                immediate environs for initial step but suggested arrangement for
                                extending Republican control might be worked out as counterpart to
                                Netherlands having transit rights through Jogja and restored
                                Republican territory. Van Royen desires technical-assistants of two

                                Favor International Red Cross and similar agencies working with

                                Jogja and immediate environs. To Republicans I pointed out flaws in
                                letter and doubted I could support certain points if they came to
                                debate. I thought it much better parties refrain from continuing
                                exchange contentious papers and iron out difficulties in personal
                                conversations so pleasantly commenced between Hatta and Van Royen.
                                After Hatta consulted twice, Roem phoned my advice accepted and
                                document still in possession Herremans should not be

                            <p>Van Royen and Hatta came 10 a. m. today. Before leaving them alone to
                                confer, I expressed appreciation Hatta’s suppression foregoing
                                letter and Van Royen’s request honored by Hague that no official

                                conciliation and agreement and restrain subordinates from acts or
                                words likely complicate situation.</p>
                            <p>After two and one-quarter hours alone, Hatta and Van Royen jointly
                                told me following: They agreed Van Royen and Roem should lunch
                                together 28th and then jointly request me submit formula which Hatta
                                and Van Royen have been unable to work out to give Hague during
                                Batavia discussions necessary assurances on cease-fire and round
                                table without “binding agreements” in strictest sense of term. (Roem
                                and Leimena have asked see me 9 a. m. 28th.)</p>
                            <p>Hatta reported Sultan Jogja insists restoration entire residency
                                essential for security and administrative purposes while Van Royen

                                Jogja and immediate environs. He agreed, however, consider with open
                                mind all arguments Sultan advances. 1 reminded Hatta January 28
                                Resolution still stands including arrangements for progressive
                                withdrawals but I could only support initial restoration Jogja and
                                immediate environs. I favored early setting up Preparatory
                                Commission which should study technical problems Jogja and make
                                recommendations, thinking this might produce aspects of problem not
                                yet appreciated by two delegations and might point way to compromise
                                solution.</p>
                            <p>Hatta said no assurance Netherlands would respect paragraph 4 (F)
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution January 28. Van
                                Roven could not revoke statements made Lake Success under
                                instructions his government. Could, however, give assurances no more
                                states to be formed during period of negotiations from former
                                Republican territory and no Netherlands desire or intention
                                eliminate Republic as entity.</p>
                            <p>Hatta prefers give no written reply to NetheDel letter submitting
                                through <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> request of <gloss

                                discussions. Said he told Anak Agung, and latter agreed, <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> not third party to dispute before
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Hatta willing <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> invite <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> participate when “<gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> considers participation necessary.” I doubted
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> could ever deem
                                participation necessary but might conceivably find it “useful”. I
                                hoped both parties would be receptive to <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> participation when points other than those
                                immediately in dispute between two parties are being considered and
                                when <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> may believe such
                                participation would be useful. I urged increased contacts between
                                Indonesians during Batavia discussions and not postponement until
                                Republic restored Jogja and Hatta invites <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss> there as he hinted. (Learned later in day that
                                Hatta entertained <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> leaders at
                                dinner last night and is obviously strengthening relations
                                therewith.) <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0404"/>I suggested
                                initial meeting at which <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> be
                                invited might be that wherein agreement on Jogja announced. Thought
                                advisable give <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> opportunity
                                question Van Royen in such meeting on plans for round-table
                                conference, et cetera. Van Royen and Sultan lunched with me. Sultan
                                said probably proceed Bangka with Hatta Friday and return Monday.
                                Sultan and Van Royen talked alone two hours <gloss
                                    target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> quarters. Van Royen phoned me
                                half hour later to report conversation. Said Sultan spoke strongly
                                in favor restoration entire residency. Van Royen expressed concern
                                lest this might lead to influx large number <gloss target="#t_TNI1"
                                    >TNI</gloss> with resultant influence on restored government.
                                Gave Sultan general idea problems discussed with Hatta. Said if
                                necessary assurances on cease-fire and Hague Conference can be
                                obtained he thought Netherlands Government would be generous in
                                considering Sultan’s idea on territory. I told Van Royen I thought
                                part Republican insistence on extended territory and paragraph 4 (F)
                                comes from fear that after Van Royen concludes agreement and leaves
                                Indonesia, local Netherlands group will not be so helpfully
                                disposed. Van Royen countered that if everything goes as expected,
                                sovereignty should be transferred three months from assembling
                                round-table and then complete release of territory achieved. Signed

                                plan of procedure. Roem asked if <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> was going to recommend any program, pointing out

                                Resolution. I told Roem we had taken initiative in calling Batavia
                                discussions between parties and in giving our ideas in my opening
                                remarks as to what discussions should cover. I had distributed
                                questions to both parties giving lead in discussions on restoration.
                                Our formal meetings had enabled both parties set forth their
                                position. Thereafter, we had gotten leaders two parties together
                                informally for ironing out major differences and deciding on
                                over-all plan. I said we prefer continue in this fashion as long as
                                progress being made. We shall have our own representatives on
                                Preparatory Committee which we hope will be set up and sent Jogja
                                shortly, and we can through them give definite suggestions. I said

                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution possible.</p>
                            <p>Called on Hatta 11:30 a. m. at his request. He said Jogja restoration
                                still big problem. Said Sultan explained to Van Royen he could not
                                assume responsibility for law and order Jogja unless entire
                                residency restored as initial step. Pointed out Netherlands control
                                only few towns and part of roads; that in remainder area Republican
                                civil administration still functions; and that <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> troops have situation in hand
                                except for bands Sjarifuddin Communists, some roving but principally
                                centering around town Pakem between Jogja and Kaliurang. Hatta and
                                Sultan both spoke with Van Royen re Maguwo, insisting if <pb n="392"
                                    xml:id="pg_392" facs="0406"/>Netherlands troops left to control
                                airfield they would likely subject night attacks. Hatta said Van
                                Royen expressed concern lest Republic might arrange for resumption
                                foreign planes landing Maguwo in trade with Singapore, etc. Hatta
                                said he definitely has no intention establishing air service from
                                Jogja with foreign lands. Thought, however, it should not be
                                required of him to put this in writing. He emphasized that if his
                                government to be strong and effective in issuing cease-fire order
                                and having support of Republicans in going Hague and there
                                negotiating, he must not be called upon to sign away prerogatives or
                                make embarrassing pledges.</p>
                            <p>I reminded Hatta I could insist on no more extensive restoration
                                Republic initially than envisaged in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> directive March 23. I added, however, that if
                                responsible Republicans including Sultan can give convincing
                                arguments that only feasible plan is to restore entire residency as
                                initial step, and if Netherlands willing accept this, I would not
                                oppose. Hatta said if <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss>
                                agrees to this, he explained to Van Royen he would not ask latter
                                give further undertaking on implementation paragraph 4(F), but would
                                request promise that Netherlands would issue no denial when Hatta
                                explained publicly to Republic that restoration Jogja residency
                                initial step in light <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution
                                January 28. Furthermore, Hatta would not initiate any move toward
                                asking extension Republic administration beyond residency during
                                period round-table conference. Hatta said cease-fire order would
                                require troops stand where they are or be concentrated in barracks.
                                Thought military and technical officials could work out details
                                satisfactorily once basic decision taken. Said no demarcation line
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>Hatta said he learned through his associates and from <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> that Van Royen meeting opposition
                                on part Beel in effort give pledge to <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1"
                                    >RepDel</gloss> that during Batavia and round-table conferences
                                Netherlands will not proceed with setting up new <hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_negara1">negara</gloss>s</hi> such as Tapanuli
                                and Djambi or permit other existing <hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_negara1">negara</gloss>s</hi> enlarge their
                                territory at expense former Republican areas. Hatta considers such
                                pledge essential.</p>
                            <p>We talked over question of formula. Of various ideas I advanced, I
                                found following to be best received: that Roem as BepDel Chairman
                                make statement in <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> meeting
                                that <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> authorized by Hatta
                                and Sukarno state they give their personal assurances they favor
                                issuance cease-fire order and acceptance round-table invitation
                                soonest possible after restoration Republican Government Jogja and
                                will insist thereon to Government. Hatta preferred Roem should make
                                statement in behalf delegation rather than in name himself and
                                Sukarno, but I argued in favor other method. It was agreed I should
                                endeavor work out formula with Van Royen and Roem. Hatta said if
                                agreement <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0407"/>could be reached
                                on formula and on restoration Jogja residency as above outlined, he
                                would be willing have this announced in <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> meeting and would then permit his delegation
                                discuss arrangements for cease-fire and matters pertinent
                                round-table conference. Said his delegation already preparing in
                                agreement with Van Royen list questions on round-table which will be
                                submitted formally through <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                or at <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> meeting formally by
                                Van Royen. Hatta departs for Bangka 29th, 10 a. m., Sultan Jogja
                                accompanying him. Latter plans return Batavia 2nd, and Van Royen
                                3rd, and perhaps go Jogja 4th. Hatta has no present plan for
                                returning, but wants discussions move rapidly as possible as he
                                thinks time against Republicans. He prefers I discuss matter of
                                exploratory committee with Roem and Leimena.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen and Roem lunched together. Former phoned 2:15 unable for
                                them discuss formula with me as planned since <gloss

                                join me noon. I told Van Royen Hatta and I had hoped get points of

                            <p>Van Royen came my quarters 2:30 to explain situation. Talk with Roem
                                had centered on restoration entire Jogja residency, progressive
                                withdrawals under 4(F), setting up no more <hi rend="italic">

                                position set forth earlier in day by Roem and Hatta to me, except on
                                two points. First, while Hatta said would seek no extension beyond
                                residency during Batavia and Hague conference, Roem seeks statement
                                by <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> that <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> would work on this problem
                                during conferences. Second point concerned <hi rend="italic">
                                    <gloss target="#t_negara1">negara</gloss>s</hi>. Van Royen said
                                that following long talk with Beel, latter had conceded to him not
                                to give formal status of <hi rend="italic">

                                Van Royen said his delegation agreed unanimously with him they could
                                not consider this subject at present stage. They insisted this

                                thereon but since his group did not see fit to draft thereon I would
                                not. I preferred leave it to <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"

                            <p>Confirmed we should meet 11 a.m. Sunday to go over draft material and
                                have as much reconciliation on views as possible between Van Royen
                                and Roem. Van Royen would favor Roem taking any draft material to
                                Bangka. He thinks we should urge however that Hatta return from
                                Bangka to Batavia on Monday with Roem. Van Royeir pointed out
                                important topics on which Roem has assumed position different from
                                that which Hatta had taken in talking with either Van Royen or me.
                                Subject on which this most seriously occurred was extent Republic
                                administration should be restored. Hatta had told me that if
                                residency Jogja restored initially he would not ask any further
                                restoration thru <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                recommendations or otherwise during Batavia and Hague conference.
                                Van Royen had been given by Hatta impression regarding status
                                desired for Republic civil servants presently in areas occupied by
                                Netherlands in conflict with Roem position set forth in Leimena
                                plan. Van Royen insists essential get Hatta here and two of us have
                                direct and decisive talks with him on 4 or 5 main points of
                                difference. He said Hatta had agreed with him when here as to
                                identity these points. He had not included much of material set
                                forth in Leimena plan presented too late for any discussion thereof
                                by Hatta on his visit. Van Royen feels that if we can get these few
                                points adjusted with Hatta himself technical groups should be able
                                work out any arrangements necessary. He is especially anxious we
                                should set up investigating committee to send Jogja soonest.</p>

                                possible one or more approaches may have been made to Sultan some
                                weeks ago when Netherlands officials Batavia hoped a <gloss

                                and doubted there had been any approach to Sultan with approbations
                                Batavia officials in sense <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1"
                                    >RepDel</gloss> indicated.</p>
                            <p>To my inquiry regarding territory Republic Government may have on
                                initial restoration, Van Royen thought he should not go beyond city
                                and immediate environs. Said Roem had shown too great proclivity
                                take everything which we have handed him as basis for bargaining
                                including formula which I had drawn up in consultation with Hatta.
                                Said he had been favorably impressed by Sultan’s approach and if
                                    <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> would respond in
                                promising manner on my formula and refrain from insisting on 4 (F)
                                arguments, he might be able go beyond limited area prescribed by
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> directive. He thought maximum
                                limit possible would be residency as whole and this could be only by
                                steps and provided things go well in area initially restored.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen said Hatta figured 2 weeks required after government
                                returns Jogja to have necessary meetings and take decisions on
                                ceasefire, Hague conference, etc. He thought after third week should
                                be possible for his group proceed Hague. Signed Cochran.</p>

                                    target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> members returned evening
                                2nd from Bangka without Hatta. Roem came later and stayed two hours.
                                His group had amended and supplemented draft material Roem, Van
                                Royen and I had prepared. Roem stated this represented final Repub
                                position and no need Hatta come explain it. Roem asked that I
                                discuss <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> draft with Van
                                Royen alone.</p>
                            <p>Spent hour and half with Van Royen this morning. Showed and explained
                                    <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> document. Van Royen
                                in turn gave me document containing <gloss target="#t_NethDel1"
                                    >NethDel</gloss> amendments and supplements to our joint
                                draft.</p>
                            <p>I then received Roem alone for two hours. I gave him Van Royen’s
                                reaction to <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> draft and
                                handed him <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> draft. I
                                explained that there were only two important points of divergency:
                                First, that <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> desires word
                                “insist” while <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> will not
                                go beyond “urge” in indicating position Sukarno and Hatta undertake
                                to advance with Repub Government when once restored Jogja in matter
                                issuing ceasefire, cooperating towards peace, law and order and
                                participating roundtable. Second matter concerns Repub’s request
                                    <gloss target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss> recognize connection
                                between restored government Jogja and Repub territory outside Jogja
                                area not occupied by Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Roem said he could yield no further. Said Natsir had already quit
                                delegation, feeling he could not support its policy. Roem regretted
                                losing this fellow <gloss target="#t_Masjoemi1">Masjumi</gloss>
                                leader and said he would have to quit chairmanship if pressed on
                                these two points. I insisted neither Van Royen nor I desired this
                                and I was sure amicable arrangement could be worked out. It was
                                agreed Roem should consult his delegation and then inform me whether
                                he desired see me again or would be ready talk with Van Royen
                                directly on differences. Idea advanced that if Roem found he could
                                not reach understanding with Van Royen latter or both should proceed
                                Bangka to lay matter before Hatta. Roem dislikes having to consult
                                Hatta again. Asked I accompany him and Van Royen if trip decided
                                upon. I have explained to both parties that <pb n="397"

                                continue be intermediary as they have requested but unless they can
                                clear up differences shortly I must take matter into <gloss

                            <p>I phoned Van Royen later regarding Boem’s position. I suggested
                                possible way out on one of the two points at issue.</p>
                            <p>Sultan Jogja had lunched with Van Royen. Latter had endeavored
                                solicit assistance Sultan in straightening out contentious points,
                                promising in turn deal generously in restoring Repub administration
                                Jogja residency.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen tells me confidentially Schuurman will be replaced by de
                                Beus when Van Royen leaves Batavia. Latter desires particularly have
                                de Beus with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> experience here to

                                    <item>If the present situation continues, the United States will
                                        neither support nor oppose a condemnatory resolution, but
                                        will abstain from voting if such a resolution is introduced.
                                        The general opinion may be expressed that no resolution
                                        should be of such character as to cause unnecessary firmness
                                        in the positions of the parties and prevent the flexibility
                                        desired in free negotiations. However, under no conditions,
                                        should the United States be put in the position of condoning
                                        Dutch policy in Indonesia or of guaranteeing the success of
                                        the Batavian talks.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>B. The above recommendations are made on the assumption that the
                                talks will be continuing and that there are evidences of substantial
                                    <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0413"/>progress. If, on the
                                other hand, the talks have definitely broken down, an impasse has
                                been reached, or if in the opinion of the Department no progress is
                                being made, the Department will re-examine its position, giving due
                                weight to the respective responsibility of each party. It is
                                believed unlikely that this situation will develop during the course
                                of the present session of the General Assembly. If the talks should
                                break down or an impasse develop, the United Nations Commission for
                                Indonesia itself will probably make positive recommendations. These
                                recommendations, together with the views of the United States
                                Representative will be given careful consideration by the Department
                                in the reformulation of its position.</p>
                            <p>C. Procedural Recommendation:</p>
                            <p>There is no question but that in the present case the Security
                                Council is actively “exercising ….<note n="1" xml:id="d276fn1"
                                    >Omission as in the original.</note> the functions assigned to
                                it” and that the General Assembly may not make any recommendation
                                with regard to the dispute (Charter, Article 12). It is the opinion
                                of the Department, however, that the Assembly has not only the power
                                of discussing the problem under Article 10 and 11, but can give
                                expression to the result of its discussions in an appropriate
                                resolution, so long as no recommendation is made. Although certain
                                resolutions expressive of opinion may be undesirable and in effect
                                interfere with the effective handling of the case by the Security
                                Council and <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>, any opposition
                                thereto should be based not on lack of power of the Assembly, but
                                rather on the inexpediency of the exercise of the power in such
                                case.</p>
                            <p>D. Further recommendations will be made as required by the course of
                                events in Batavia.</p>

                                disappointment in Netherlands’ revision draft material. Said their

                                mandate to Hatta since they feared they could not arrive at

                                entirely wrong think of such step. I pointed out that there had been
                                no direct conversations between Van Royen and Roem since each had
                                transmitted to other through me his revision of original draft
                                material. I was sure Van Royen could make certain changes in his
                                draft and said its normal course of negotiations for final draft to
                                be reached through each side setting forth its ideas and then
                                getting together for reconciliation. Roem said he would consult his

                                depends on willingness Netherlands Government restore Jogja

                            <p>88. Burton, who returned with Prime Minister Chifley from London this
                                week, sent for me, today and expounded for an hour the present
                                Australian position on Indonesia. He spoke with unusual earnestness

                            <p>Burton said as background that in London Chifley expressed in strong
                                language to other Commonwealth Prime Ministers and senior British
                                Cabinet Ministers following thesis: the Indonesian problem has been
                                handled very badly from every point of view; on basis of Critchley’s
                                reports from Batavia, repeatedly proved sound in past, Australia
                                satisfied that Dutch are making no general effort reach settlement;
                                there will be no such effort until UK and US compel Dutch make it;
                                meanwhile situation Southeast Asia growing worse all the time.</p>
                            <p>Burton said he believed Chifley made deep impression on Commonwealth
                                Prime Ministers and especially on Attlee,<note n="2"

                                time for UK give cooperation to Australia if it expected continuing
                                cooperation, for example loans in return. Remarked incidentally that
                                Chifley refused attend London meeting on aid Burma, riot for reason
                                suggested by press, but only because he believed any country
                                furnishing arms to Burma could expect same outcome as US had with
                                Nationalists in China. Said graft and corruption in Burma far worse
                                than ever in China.</p>
                            <p>Burton said Nehru and Chifley see eye to eye on Indonesia.</p>

                                would find <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> unanimous in
                                opinion Maguwo should be considered as part “Jogja and its immediate

                                whether 5 or 20 km. from city limits.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen said question would rise as to whether in event whole

                                Van Royen airport if given Republic should not be used, as
                                Netherlands fears, for bringing in arms or engaging in smuggling
                                operations. I thought we should take precautions prevent any such
                                development. Am studying what documentation available including

                                statements by two chairmen. I told them I anticipated posing
                                following question after two statements: “Will the two chairmen
                                kindly confirm my understanding that the statements which they have
                                just made were agreed upon in consultation, that each finds himself
                                in accord with the position set forth by the other, and that the
                                statements are hereby formally confirmed and accepted.” I Showed
                                draft letter re Maguwo and explained still subject approval by
                                parties. Obtained colleagues’ approval proposed press release.</p>

                                informally at noon. Agreed on following text my draft letter: “It is
                                agreed that with return of Republican Government to Jogja and with

                                chairmen replied affirmatively. I then said: “May I express my
                                genuine appreciation of the excellent spirit in which the chairmen
                                and their delegates have worked in their informal discussions and
                                congratulate them warmly upon the results achieved. I think we
                                should hereinafter refer to these results as ‘the Van Royen–Roem
                                statements’.”</p>
                            <p>Van Royen replied: “I am happy to state on my part that my government
                                is gratified at the first positive and hopeful results which this
                                preliminary conference has obtained. I feel they augur well for the
                                future. I wish assure Dr. Roem, as chairman his delegation, that
                                agreement we have just reached will be carried out on our part with
                                fairness and loyalty and that we shall see to it that no reprisals
                                are taken and that no victimization occurs against anyone belonging
                                to the other party. Allow me, Sir, to express before I end these
                                brief remarks, my appreciation and sincere thanks to your
                                commission, and more especially to yourself, for tUNCFI’s constant
                                and fortunately fruitful efforts to assist the parties in arriving
                                at an agreement.”</p>
                            <p>Roem said in turn: “I am grateful for the expressions of Dr. Van
                                Royen. We too shall implement the agreement in the same spirit. We
                                share Dr. Van Royen’s feelings, and shall do our utmost working in
                                the same direction”.</p>
                            <p>I stated understood that two delegations desire to meet informally on
                                Monday afternoon May 9 to name members to two committees envisaged
                                in statements just made and to plan work thereof. Furthermore
                                members to be named by and from commission itself to those
                                committees will join the conversations. While its preparatory
                                committee is working, commission will continue to meet in Batavia
                                for discussion of other items of agenda.</p>

                                restoration. He added that it is folly for any Dutchman to hope they
                                will be thrown out, because, if they were, a Communist government

                            <p>In separate conversation with Van Royen and Critchley today, reviewed
                                Republican situation. From Netherlands military and civilian sources
                                Van Royen and I had rumors possibility Sultan endeavoring aggrandize
                                personal position expense Sukarno and Hatta and also of certain
                                    <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> elements, possibly
                                preferring emergency government to Sukarno–Hatta regime. Critchley
                                insists no danger either development if present trend in
                                negotiations and arrangements continues although no one can vouch
                                for scattered Republican military groups. Critchley thinks some

                            <p>In course conversation fol points emerged: (1) Sudarpo said that it
                                was Hatta’s position that Repub cld attend Hague Conf only if it
                                held under <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> auspices and
                                that in no event cld he attend under Neth auspices. <gloss
                                    target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officers indicated that they were
                                not aware that Hatta felt so strongly this matter and asked if he
                                had represented these views to Cochran. Sudarpo said he did not know
                                but that he thought Roem had done so. <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss> officers impressed upon trio importance of
                                minimizing prestigious considerations, of getting ahead with orderly
                                transfer of sovereignty to <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> and
                                of importance to Neth Govt and people of some face-saving device
                                such as acting as hosts at Hague Conf. Trio unimpressed, asked if
                                    <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> favorably disposed toward
                                rotating chairmanship at Hague Conf. <gloss target="#t_Dept1"
                                    >Dept</gloss> officers replied <gloss target="#t_Dept1"

                                insisted that matters shld be settled Batavia. (2) Trio much
                                concerned that Hatta’s Sukarno’s return to Jogja be attended by
                                appearance of needed police equipment, public utilities and consumer
                                goods to the end that their influence with wavering constituents be
                                restored. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officers explained
                                Cochran’s view that such things shld be provided by Neth who under
                                obligation to do so May 7 agreement. Trio obviously partially
                                satisfied when told that Neth already prepared to supply jeeps and
                                other equipment as well as uniforms for police and that arming of
                                police presently under discussion. Trio stated that if textiles,
                                medicines, office equipment, etc supplied by Neth inadequate, they
                                wld feel compelled to try to get such supplies to Hatta, Sukarno
                                from US. (3) Sudarpo said that Sukarno had told him that solution of
                                    <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> problem now rested solely
                                with US, that if US “backed down” he and Hatta were finished and
                                that chaos and Communism wld be inevitable result in Indonesia.
                                    <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officers replied to effect
                                that Indonesians must learn to stand on own feet, that US position
                                in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> dispute result of UN
                                participation. <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> officers
                                declared their awareness Commie threat Indonesia and their great
                                concern that it be liquidated. This connection, reported execution
                                Tan Malaka discussed, trio claiming they had confirmation this
                                report, for which they were congratulated. (4) Trio anticipates

                                conversations with Foreign Office officials re Hague Conference have
                                made it plain to us that the Dutch contemplate conference under
                                Netherlands auspices and chairmanship. We cannot see them
                                entertaining idea of any other procedure. Their reasoning is clearly
                                that Netherlands sovereignty over Indonesia is still intact, that it
                                is they, the Dutch, who are to hand over part of this sovereignty,
                                that it is the Dutch Government which automatically plays the host
                                in the capital and that the principals of Netherlands Delegation
                                will be the Netherlands Cabinet.</p>
                            <p>We believe, therefore, that any proposals of conference being held
                                under other auspices or of rotating chairmanship would probably be
                                flatly turned down by Netherlands Government with full approval
                                Dutch public. We hope, therefore, that conference will not be
                                jeopardized by any such suggestion.</p>

                                    >Dept</gloss> has recently noted from various sources
                                expressions of a defeatist attitude on part of certain Neth and
                                Repub officials re eventual outcome in Indonesia. Concern of these
                                officials centers upon danger that Hatta Govt, after restoration,
                                may not be able successfully to resist extremist pressures. Both
                                sides imply that large measure of responsibility devolves upon US

                                returned Batavia 7 p. m. Received Roem, Sultan Jogja, Leimena and
                                Sastroamidjojo this morning. Sastro recounted trip with Hatta. Said

                                officials and population. Col. Hidayat, Republic Military Commander
                                Sumatra, had been obliged travel several days on foot from his
                                headquarters Central Sumatra to participate in meetings with Hatta.

                                possible for first time and utilized advantageously. Sastro said by

                                thought outlook for cooperation entirely favorable. Methods being

                                order were shown. Hidayat was to return to his troops. No military

                                apparently ended and emphasized necessity following soonest with
                                Netherlands’ military evacuation. Raised question as to whether
                                    <gloss target="#t_RepubDel1">RepDel</gloss> would ask Hatta,
                                when Roem and group spend tomorrow Bangka to approve in present form
                                and without waiting longer for Repub military advisor, three

                                or have additions to make which could not properly be included in

                            <p>Roem stated Hatta would like invite Van Royen visit him Bangka
                                shortly. I was sure Van Royen would accept and thought it might be
                                possible gentlemen’s agreement on above point with respect to
                                approving three documents at once might be worked out on this

                                before evacuation Netherlands military. He contended his government
                                should then have privilege revealing these documents to Parliament.
                                Republicans argued this would seriously prejudice acceptance thereof
                                at Jogja since they would be publicized and criticized several days
                                in advance of possible consideration by Republican parliamentary

                                Batavia decisions should not be presented as accomplished fact.</p>
                            <p>I commented that three documents are largely on political level,
                                should be acceptable because of general and fair character and
                                advanced idea that almost anything <gloss target="#t_TNI1"
                                    >TNI</gloss> advisors might have to say would likely fit in

                                such idea but firmly against any subsequent amendments to three
                                documents after formalized in <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss>. Said he would visit Hatta if Republicans desired
                                but could not change his position on this point or on revealing
                                agreements to Netherlands Parliament. I observed that if documents
                                formalized in <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>, they would
                                be subject to <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> rules

                                    >UNCFI</gloss> would only approve of public revelation of terms

                                would still draw in representatives of areas other than Republic

                            <p>Roem and Leimena came 9:30 p. m. after return from Bangka. Roem said
                                no purpose Van Royen visiting Hatta unless willing reach gentlemen’s
                                agreement with latter whereunder <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>
                                would have something to say on three documents after return Jogja.
                                Hatta unwilling follow “take it or leave it” tactics with <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. Similarly he opposes revelation

                                Jogja when Republican Government returns. Roem said had
                                understanding with Van Royen he was to see him 13th re conditions
                                for Hague Conference. In answer my question, said had cleared
                                everything with Hatta re conditions Hague Conference but point of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>’s role remained to be
                                settled with Netherlands. I reminded Roem I had set forth clearly my
                                views on this (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1">Gocus</gloss> 723). He was
                                confident this matter could be adjusted amicably with Van Royen.</p>
                            <p>I suggested Roem make definite appointment at once with Van Royen and
                                that he should let Van Royen know Hatta was agreeable to three
                                documents in present form with only one or two minor alterations
                                subject to “door being left slightly open” for <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. I told Roem he should to [<hi

                                unannounced to me, for determining <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"

                                then report Hatta’s feelings re leaving opportunity for <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> technical views to be considered
                                and re simultaneous revelation formalized documents after government
                                restored Jogja. I reminded Roem of Van Royen’s difficult position
                                and insisted they should both continue work in spirit mutual
                                confidence that has marked their relations to date. Roem phoned Van
                                Royen from my quarters and made appointment for 10:30 a. m.
                                Monday.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> representatives met this
                                morning on draft invitation for representatives outside Republic.
                                Hamid came see me immediately afterwards to state having difficulty
                                with Mansur in keeping [apparent garble] out and group considering
                                asking Hatta receive seven <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss>
                                leaders Bangka 15th to discuss question. I asked Hamid to come with
                                Anak Agung 4 p. m. today to see with <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                    >UNCFI</gloss> representative whether <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"

                            <p>Received Van Royen his request 11:30 a. m. He said Roem had just
                                visited him and Republicans had not weakened any as result visit
                                Hatta from position assumed night 11th herein above-mentioned. Van
                                Royen expressed conviction Republicans felt they could not count on
                                    <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. I said failure get <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> advisors here not necessarily due
                                such reason but might partially be attributed to difficulty and risk
                                traveling through Netherlands lines, objection of Netherlands to
                                    <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> advisors proceed Batavia
                                from Jogja in uniform and insignia, et cetera Van Royen said BepDel
                                should not be excused from keeping commitments because of inability
                                control <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. I reminded him Sassen
                                and Stikker had used some same argument that Republic could not
                                control <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> when mission broke off
                                promising negotiations last fall and resorted to second police
                                action. I said Republicans had suffered seriously through second
                                police action and we had all realized from time <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Resolution January 28 that risk would
                                be involved in attempting restore Jogja, et cetera. I complimented
                                him on manner in which he had conducted negotiations and pictured
                                great confidence which Republicans have in him. I recalled advice
                                given him on our first meeting here to effect that we would have
                                many disappointments in dealing with [apparent garble] since they do
                                not always think along our lines and are in such comparatively weak
                                position when it comes to making binding commitments that can be
                                implemented.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen urged me talk alone again with Roem and associates and see
                                if I could get them meet his position. I asked whether (1) he would
                                agree to advice <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> advisors, when
                                obtained, being placed in field manual; (2) he would agree
                                restoration Jogja on formalizing three Committee Two documents in
                                present form or as may be modified immediate future by <gloss

                                    target="#t_NethDel1">NethDel</gloss>; and (3) he would see no
                                publicity given documents so formalized until Republican Government
                                    <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0441"/>restored Jogja in
                                position present documents to Parliament. I asked further whether
                                necessary he submit any amendments to three documents before
                                considering them final from Netherlands side. He said he would and
                                amendments would cover some serious points. Re my questions, he said
                                there had been no undertaking on his part keep terms confidential
                                and promise had been made Netherlands Parliament they would see
                                agreement. I suggested terms might be made known confidentially to
                                Parliament committee as had been gentlemen’s agreement on Hatta
                                risking government in support policy decided Batavia discussions.
                                Van Royen indicated willingness recommend documents be seen only in
                                closed session Parliament as whole, provided I could get Republicans
                                agree final approval three documents Batavia discussions. I stressed
                                danger being overly formalistic and risk we would all incur if
                                oblige Republicans act in any way other than that which they thought
                                most likely obtain support <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. He
                                properly pointed out we could not leave too many loose ends to be
                                tied up Jogja. I hope see Roem later today for frank discussion.

                                secure reasonable compliance cease fire from Repub adherents outside

                                such contingency eventuate, Neth wld be in position to insist on

                                from Baruch and Valentine: This is joint statement Embassy and
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> mission in full agreement in
                                response to Department/<gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> 499, June
                                10, sent Batavia as 320.</p>
                            <p>Cogent reasoning in Department’s 499 appeals strongly to us. We
                                believe plan entirely feasible and timing should be now.</p>
                            <p>Answers to questions your penultimate paragraph should properly <pb
                                    n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0446"/>come from Cochran, not us,
                                but we offer following comments and suggestions.</p>
                            <p>On basis our information, amount of aid proposed entirely inadequate
                                but realize your present problems and limitations. Therefore suggest
                                emphasis be not upon amount but upon renewal of aid to all Indonesia
                                as vital to development democratic government there through
                                provision of basic economic needs.</p>
                            <p>While distribution of proposed aid presumably must at present be made
                                through Dutch channels, we believe you can find way to arrange that
                                Hatta, with Dutch cooperation and agreement, can play effective
                                public role in helping determine recipients of aid and in working
                                out relative requirements on geographical basis of different areas
                                of Indonesia. If plan succeeds, Hatta government would then claim
                                and probably receive credit for having brought about conditions
                                which achieved aid for all Indonesia on equal basis. This should
                                strengthen Hatta government against extremists, and also strengthen
                                US position with Indonesians as a whole by supporting their desire
                                to govern their own affairs.</p>
                            <p>Consequently it is further highly desirable if possible to include in
                                planning and approval other Indonesian native elements, not Dutch or
                                Republican, if this can be done without undue delay in providing
                                aid, but we repeat need is urgent and its early fulfillment should
                                take precedence over ideal arrangement which might be sort of
                                all-Indonesian economic organization along general lines of <gloss
                                    target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>If Hatta government and <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> also
                                judged capable of assisting in distribution of aid, so much the
                                better, but if Dutch [apparent omission] has any validity it seems
                                doubtful that existing personnel experience and conditions would
                                make for reliable distribution in Indonesia except through Dutch at
                                present.</p>
                            <p>If above plan followed, we believe it removes possibility of being
                                construed as effort to aid Dutch in Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>We believe Netherlands Government now has sincere desire to achieve
                                objectives stated in Department’s 499 and would cooperate in above
                                plan. Our opinion fortified by discreet inquiries of key Netherlands

                            <p>Before Roem left for Bangka to submit drafts for Hatta’s approval he
                                thanked me warmly for my support and said was confident could obtain
                                Hatta’s approval. Gave complete sets documents to Critchley and
                                Herremans. They had been familiar with three major documents until
                                stage of final negotiations. They both approved manner in which I
                                had sought way out of difficulty through exchange letters, et
                                cetera. <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would be unanimous
                                therefore if Netherlands Government should react to these documents
                                in any manner which would risk weakening Republic at this time.</p>
                            <p>While I have not endeavored in my messages to explain every move to
                                Department, it should be understood that when I am serving as
                                middleman at request two chairmen, I present each side’s position to
                                other when asked do so without myself taking commitment thereon.
                                When thereafter I get parties together to work out compromise, it
                                frequently occurs that my own formula is accepted. For instance, I
                                yesterday dictated following: “Both parties shall cooperate fully in
                                maintaining law and order, in protecting all elements of population
                                and in facilitating each other’s measures of self defense” which was
                                accepted as substitute for several last minute contentious
                                Netherlands Delegation amendments, including following: “Parties
                                shall not extend their military action to areas assigned to other
                                party, unless armed forces of <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443"

                                regulations, constitute immediate danger to armed forces of other

                                extent that population urgently requires to be protected. In these
                                instances parties shall instantly report to their governments and to

                            <p>523. <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 512, June 14. Always
                                possible some elements Netherlands Government might have alternate
                                courses action in back of minds should Van Royen–Roem agreement
                                prove abortive. However, Embassy believes leading cabinet figures
                                such as Drees or Stikker intend fullest Netherlands effort to
                                implement agreement, restoration law and order and Hague conference.
                                This also holds true of Lovink in our opinion. Since departure of
                                Sassen from Overseas Territories portfolio, <pb n="444"
                                    xml:id="pg_444" facs="0458"/>that Ministry under Van Maarseveen
                                seems to have pursued straight forward course and not endeavored to
                                torpedo the course of Drees and Stikker as was Sassen’s habit.
                                Lovink’s successor, Boon, is most decidedly taking every possible
                                step to have <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> instructions
                                implemented. We have not in any of our contacts with government or
                                Foreign Office officials encountered any indication Machiavellian
                                plans.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy’s language in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                                491, June 9, was ambiguous. Reference clause was meant to mean Dutch
                                were relinquishing part of their total worldwide sovereignty in
                                giving sovereignty Indonesia. Frequent declarations have been made
                                by Dutch officials that the Netherlands Government intends to hand
                                over sovereignty to <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> completely
                                and unconditionally. (See Stikker’s remarks <gloss

                            <p>This is the first time Embassy has seen reference to “initial”
                                restoration. We think that Netherlands Government went beyond <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> instructions re restoration by
                                including whole residency Djocja in a gesture of goodwill and with
                                hope that this gesture would be recognized and might forestall wider
                                demands that would jeopardize negotiations. However, we do not
                                believe that Netherlands Government has contemplated that
                                restoration of further territory to Republic would be necessary at
                                present stage in solution Indonesian problem.</p>
                            <p>Re police equipment, Dutch are apparently exercising extreme caution
                                perhaps too much for fear arms they turn over to Republic will
                                encourage ambitious regain more dominant position by Republic
                                regime. We do not recall that Dutch have ever been obligated to
                                transfer sufficient police equipment for maintenance law and order
                                beyond present contemplated Republic area. On other hand re
                                hypothesis mentioned in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>,
                                we know that Dutch are anxious that cease fire be effected and
                                effective. Foreign Office feels that Soekarno–Hatta government must
                                be strengthened and maintained else Communist government would be
                                set up. (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 440, May 19).</p>
                            <p>Netherlands Government and people have progressed very considerably
                                in their attitudes towards the international reaction to Indonesian
                                question as well as to their own thoughts about Indonesia. It has
                                been drummed into them from every side that their actions have been
                                stupid and arrogant, flouting as they have world public opinion. We
                                believe that they are now sincerely anxious to rehabilitate
                                themselves internationally. With respect to Indonesia, the Dutch
                                have seen a steady drain on their resources, guerrilla warfare and
                                no real progress made since the war ended. They have now resigned
                                themselves <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0459"/>to the
                                inevitable and want the Indonesian question cleared up quickly.</p>
                            <p>If despite their best efforts, it is not settled—and some officials
                                including Stikker are not entirely convinced that it will be—then
                                the Dutch believe they can have clear conscience and stronger case
                                before world if they should be confronted with possible alternative
                                of complete retirement from Indonesia.</p>

                                four freedoms and should be bulwark against Communism.</p>
                            <p>RepDel had just returned from visiting leaders Bangka via Palembang
                                where Malik, Sumatran <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> leaders,
                                had invited them for short stop. Van Royen speaking with Roem asked
                                me join them and decide which was right. Van Royen argued that three
                                principal draft documents Committee 2 should be formalized secretly
                                in <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> session after expected
                                approval in present form by Hatta and Netherlands Government. I said
                                formalizing with <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> should only
                                come after Republican Government has returned to Jogja and there
                                approved final form and Netherlands Government concurred therein.
                                Roem said this was certainly his understanding of situation, after
                                we resorted to exchange of letter idea. Van Royen did not argue
                                further apparently accepting our view.</p>
                            <p>Roem said he had experienced more difficult time Bangka than
                                expected. Said leaders had thought three draft documents, as they
                                had seen them previous Sunday, were in form desired by Netherlands
                                and had not realized that Netherlands military and Hague had not had
                                opportunity give their opinions thereon. Three of us agreed
                                tentatively on changes two or three words in drafts.</p>
                            <p>Roem then said Hatta sought fixing definite date for return
                                Republican Government, namely, by beginning of Muslim fast days on
                                27 June, before he would consent to exchange letters. I opposed this
                                as did Van Royen. I pointed out that: <list>

                                Bangka who reported interviews wherein Sukarno criticized alleged
                                delays by Netherlands in restoration, etc., and insisted through
                                press on plan Roem put up to us night 17 re return of leaders to
                                Jogja by June 27. Such Republican publicity together with revived
                                Australian and Indian criticism only adds to burden consummate
                                genuinely fair agreements with Indonesians soonest. I am convinced
                                of Van Royen’s good intentions and confident best results can be
                                achieved by refraining from expressions of doubt to Hague on our
                                part that may be passed on to him. If impasse should arise, I would
                                prefer first exhaust my efforts with Van Royen and Lovink. Again I
                                object to idea trying effect reapprochement with Dutch through

                                and could give no early results. Since Roem insisted could take no

                            <p>Roem asked for eight p. m. appointment. I phoned Van Royen that Roem
                                coming since Van Royen continued perturbed over political situation
                                Hague. I told Van Royen that unless conciliatory statement arranged
                                to be issued Jogja after receipt by Roem my letter this morning
                                    (<gloss target="#t_Gocus1">Gocus</gloss> 755<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d318fn2">Not printed.</note>) I would suggest Roem make
                                appropriate statement tonight or morning 13th. Van Royen agreed. He
                                expressed sympathy over loss 13 US press correspondents since crash
                                their plane over India just announced.</p>
                            <p>Roem came eight p. m. Had discussed my letter with Hatta. Said Hatta
                                and others all unhappy over speech of welcome made sixth by vice
                                chairman working committee. Said both Hatta and he had subsequently
                                issued statements seeking to offset these unfortunate remarks. They
                                felt, however, that there had been nothing in other Republican
                                speeches or statements Jogja to which Hague properly could take
                                exception. Nevertheless they desired improve atmosphere soonest and
                                most effectively. Roem said first Cabinet meeting scheduled for
                                night 13th and possibility Hatta issuing statement thereafter.</p>
                            <p>I told Roem speech after Cabinet meeting would be too late for Van
                                Royen’s need. I suggested Roem himself make press statement Batavia
                                morning 13th reporting first few days at Jogja following restoration
                                Republic. He said atmosphere was good, all political leaders working
                                together and Hatta assured he would have unanimous vote of approval
                                in Cabinet. Furthermore Sjafruddin will turn in his authority at
                                Cabinet meeting and support Hatta. Although date not yet fixed for
                                working committee meeting, Hatta thinks possibly only one dissenting
                                vote therein. Following return General Sudirman to Jogja, Hatta has
                                conferred with him and other military leaders. No objection on their
                                part to cease hostilities, only question being that of arriving at
                                    <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0473"/>technical measures to
                                prevent clashes in exceptional circumstances which will obtain after
                                cease hostilities ordered and two forces remain so intertwined. Said
                                Leimena working seriously with Simatupang on compilation manual and
                                remaining Jogja to complete Republican version thereof with <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> advisors. Roem said progress on all
                                lines moving as quickly and satisfactorily as could be expected and
                                optimistic final and favorable decisions can be taken shortly after
                                20th which will permit Republicans go Hague for <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> early in August in same spirit
                                cooperation that has characterized Batavia discussions.</p>
                            <p>I asked Roem use in his statement as much foregoing information as he
                                could possibly reveal without hurting Hatta’s cause and also to
                                repeat some sentences from his earlier statement at Jogja well as
                                Hatta’s since these had not been translated and broadcast in
                                entirety. I suggested further he visit Van Royen soon as statement
                                prepared and prior its issuance in order Van Royen could see it and
                                phone text by noon to Hague for use before Parliament. Roem
                                agreed.</p>
                            <p>I referred to second part my letter to Roem raising question placing
                                Republican representatives in <gloss target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss>
                                Ministries. Roem had discussed this with Hatta. They favored idea
                                provided representatives would be and remain Republican officials
                                having contact and liaison with <gloss target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss>
                                Government and not become officials or employees of latter. I said
                                appropriate arrangements and announcements along this line should
                                await finalization agreement Jogja.</p>
                            <p>I said foregoing plan might eventually pave way for joint approach by
                                Netherlands and Indonesia for revival <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> aid. I had not mentioned <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> to single Republican since question recently raised
                                by Department. Roem promptly remarked <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> should not be revived until agreement reached at
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and sovereignty transferred.
                                I said under present set up <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid
                                could not be given <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> as sovereign
                                state. I said some special arrangement would have to be made as for
                                Korea or some other source funds sought. Roem looks upon <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> as means obliging parties work
                                together rather than source dollars which could play any important
                                part in Indonesian economy this juncture.</p>

                                    xml:id="pg_460" facs="0474"/>inspired importantly by fact that

                                progressing towards desired end. Again I reiterate that if present

                                Royen and Roem met with me. I gave them my draft formula as
                                follows:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Local commanders shall impress upon their forces that the more

                                    the sooner diminution of patrols and other military burdens can
                                    be accomplished. Improvement in situation that permits
                                    diminution in patrols should lead to next step of diminution of
                                    outposts. Outlying forces should then be found of necessity in
                                    what may be the more troubled areas, and elsewhere may be
                                    assembled in most convenient centers. As this process develops,
                                    way is prepared for reduction in armed forces, return of members
                                    thereof to their homes and to productive pursuits, and

                                changing “lead to” to “clear way for” in preceding sentence. He
                                agreed our request to take care of purport eliminated sentence
                                through approaching Lovink and C-in-C Buurman Van Vreeden
                                immediately on return Batavia and subsequently speaking with
                                Netherlands Government Hague if necessary. At Hatta’s request, Van
                                Royen gave oral undertaking to Hatta evening 28th in above sense.
                                Van Royen arranged that Hatta and Sultan Jogja should meet with
                                Lovink soonest and have latter discuss and confirm his understanding
                                of Van Royen’s undertaking to Hatta. Van Royen’s position is that
                                Netherlands cannot politically now make concessions which involve
                                troop withdrawals or definite promises thereon. States that if cease
                                hostilities orders issued in good faith and reasonable response
                                results therefrom, Lovink and C-in-C will be willing move toward
                                meeting Simatupang’s ideas. Van Royen has requested Republic
                                delegation agree on certain areas where they think most effective
                                cease hostilities response can quickly be achieved and concentrate
                                on accomplishing results there soonest. These could then be cited to
                                Lovink and C-in-C and to Hague as examples of satisfactory
                                developments which should encourage progress desired by
                                Republicans.</p>

                                orally given Hatta Jogja. This involved Simatupang plan for

                                larger centers. This especially desired by Republican military as

                                Committee, but would not oppose Indonesians if they insist thereon.

                                chairmanship very difficult politically for Netherlands, I suggested
                                he should be one to approach Hatta and Roem with frank explanation.
                                He would suggest chairmanship that committee rotate between
                                Netherlands, <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> and Republic as

                                from Batavia exaggerated situation. I stressed need to perpetuate
                                mutual confidence and contact between Lovink and Sultan Jogja.
                                Stikker realizes Lovink has only handful of newly sent assistants
                                and that old guard may still try color reports and make difficulties
                                for government policy. He said he would write Lovink personal letter

                                concern over infiltrations in Indonesia. Said report of 4-hour talk
                                between Sultan and Lovink unsatisfactory. I gave assurances along
                                line of talk with Stikker previous evening and urged patience during
                                time required to untangle difficult military situation Indonesia. I
                                praised work of Van Royen and hoped good atmosphere would continue

                            <p>Queen said gratified progress made on Indonesia question since I saw
                                her in February; said Netherlands had nothing to hide from
                                Indonesians; decision of government to transfer sovereignty could
                                not be questioned; Netherlands bore Indonesians no enmity and was
                                sure latter would bear Netherlands no enmity. I expressed optimism
                                over relations of Netherlands with future <gloss target="#t_USI1"

                                move quickly to satisfactory conclusion in spirit of mutual trust.
                                She said also confident of outcome, realizing that aims of both
                                sides had really never been far apart. Queen said could not
                                understand Australian policy. I ventured no explanation.</p>

                                renewed acquaintance I followed same line as with Queen and Stikker
                                in trying calm their doubts over Indonesian observance cease
                                hostilities orders. I did likewise when British Chargé telephoned to
                                tell me how worried Netherlands were over Indonesian situation.</p>
                            <p>My reception here has been entirely friendly to date. I am quite
                                satisfied with progress made this week in preparing for conference
                                both in way of drafting rules of procedure and in getting leaders to
                                working harmoniously together. I am confident settlement can be
                                negotiated <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> if military situation
                                Indonesia can be controlled. I feel it can be controlled if military
                                strengthened and if concerted efforts made to keep cool heads.

                                    Mr. Cochran summarized his policy of letting the parties
                                    concerned work out agreement as far as possible between
                                    themselves, with assistance only when required. (501.BC
                                    Indonesia/8–949)</note> Looking toward the opening of the Round
                                Table Conference the Department desires to confirm the soundness of
                                your approach to the tasks ahead and to set forth views upon issues
                                of the Conference. First, it is believed advisable to summarize for
                                general purposes within the Department and Government certain
                                elementary propositions, long familiar to you and others who have
                                been striving toward settlement of the Indonesian dispute,
                                describing United States interests in a settlement of the problem.
                                These factors lead to an enumeration of a second group of
                                principles, namely, <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0489"/>those
                                basic considerations guiding plans for and participation in <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>’s efforts to aid the parties
                                in accomplishing the Conference’s objectives.</p>
                            <p>A. In the light of the preliminary agreement reached within the last
                                three months and of the major steps taken by the parties toward
                                final settlement of the dispute, most of the substantive issues of
                                the conference are of primary concern to the parties alone, with
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> and individual members
                                thereof asserting ideas actively only when assistance is necessary
                                or desired. Yet the U.S. is vitally interested in the outcome of the
                                controversy and in the settlement reached at The Hague. And this
                                concern carries a corollary interest in certain phases of the
                                conference’s deliberations.</p>
                            <p>This country’s immediate interest rests upon long participation in UN
                                efforts to settle the dispute. Various Security Council resolutions
                                delineating UN interests and responsibilities with respect to the
                                controversy are still in effect. The dispute still exists, even
                                though both parties have complied with a substantial portion of the
                                obligatory elements of the January 28 resolution. Under that
                                resolution and according to the express intentions of the
                                Netherlands and the Republic the UN may continue to exercise an
                                active role in the situation, particularly with respect to
                                observation or supervision of elections even after the formal
                                transfer of sovereignty. Moreover, the item is still before the
                                General Assembly and it is unlikely that the item will be dropped
                                from the Assembly’s agenda prior to a substantial settlement of the
                                dispute.</p>
                            <p>Of critical importance is our concern over the stability of Southeast
                                Asia and the development of friendly, peace-loving and economically
                                sound governments in that area. It is of equal importance, in the
                                context of United States world policy, that the adjustment in
                                Indonesia be accomplished in a fashion which will not vitiate the
                                Netherlands’ position as a leading democratic nation.</p>
                            <p>Unless an amicable settlement, allowing room for the peaceful
                                adjustment of nationalist aspirations, is accomplished by the
                                parties, Southeast Asia and Indonesia will be more susceptible to
                                Communist expansion. This hazard would constitute a major source of
                                trouble for the U.S. and the free world.</p>
                            <p>Various Members of the U.N. will be asked to participate in and
                                contribute substantially to a program for the economic
                                rehabilitation and development of Indonesia after the establishment
                                of the new federal government. It may be anticipated that this
                                country will be requested to supply public and private capital for
                                economic purposes. Since all plans for economic rehabilitation and
                                development necessarily presuppose a sound political structure in
                                the new nation, all <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0490"/>other
                                nations contemplating participation in future Indonesian economic
                                development must be concerned with the political stability of the
                                new nation.</p>
                            <p>B. For all of the foregoing reasons certain of the specific terms of
                                transfer and of Indonesia’s proposed governmental structure are of
                                more than general interest. As parts of what is believed to be a
                                sound basis for a just settlement through the U.N., the following
                                are cardinal elements of U.S. policy: <list>

                                        standpoint of a just solution that the conference be
                                        conducted in a fashion which will give reasonable voice to
                                        the views of the Republic and the other elements of the
                                        Indonesian group, particularly with respect to the structure
                                        and powers of the new Indonesian state. Similarly,
                                        appropriate weight upon issues of transfer and the formation
                                        of the Union must be accorded the views of the

                                        After the transfer of sovereignty, this state should be

                                    <item>Since the adoption of the Linggadjati agreement both the
                                        Republic and the Netherlands have frequently committed
                                        themselves to the principle that a Netherlands–Indonesia
                                        Union be formed; and <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1"
                                            >UNCFI</gloss>’s proposals for settlement have
                                        encompassed such a relationship. Hence, in fulfilling mutual
                                        commitments the new state and the Netherlands should, as a
                                        part of the forthcoming settlement, enter into a bona fide
                                        Union. As with other settlement problems, the precise form
                                        and scope of powers of the Union are matters for decision
                                        between the parties. Presumably, as under previous plans,
                                        the Union will reach its decisions upon consultation,
                                        requiring the affirmative vote of both Indonesia and the
                                        Netherlands. The parties to the Union should consider the
                                        obligations imposed by the U.N. Charter when they formulate
                                        the projected defense relationship under which both the new
                                        nation and the Union may carry on consultation and make
                                        cooperative arrangements for Indonesian defense with other

                            <p>Beyond these essential principles, the concern of the U.S. with
                                respect to the work of the <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> is to
                                aid in seeing that nothing holds up the rapid completion of the

                                preliminary to the transfer of sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>If efforts are made by the conference’s representatives to include
                                the principles enumerated above, the U.S. should not urge any

                                to the new nation, and the control of armed forces during the

                                Said Prime Minister Drees requested he inform me contents long
                                message received from Lovink this week-end. Van Royen read excerpts
                                therefrom.</p>

                                and fear deterioration might spread to West Java. General Engles

                                administration. Principal problem apparently that of suppressing
                                Daral Islam.</p>

                                reportedly moving considerable numbers to “envelop” Dutch outposts
                                and lines communication. Instances cited of armed <gloss

                                only slowly if at all. Lovink reported Indonesian civilian
                                authorities these areas sometimes kidnapped but more frequently fled
                                because intimidation on part <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>.
                                Feared disappearance such civilian officers would lead to general
                                break-up of authority and such poor administration that economic
                                situation, well as that of law and order will worsen. Lovink said
                                circumstances called for exercise extreme self-control on part
                                Netherlands military.</p>
                            <p>Report suggested younger <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>
                                officers, including one colonel, were evidently trying see “how much
                                they could get away with”. Sultan Jogja reported as hesitant
                                intervene alleging instructions should emanate from Sukarno or
                                Sudirman. Answer my question, Van Royen said he would bring reported
                                situation to attention Hatta. I suggested he <pb n="479"
                                    xml:id="pg_479" facs="0493"/>also consult Leimena and

                            <p>Van Royen said Lovink and he both thought best hope obtaining
                                amelioration situation is through <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> acting independently or through <gloss

                                party. I said I would pass this to Department and Dow although sure
                                latter doing everything possible to achieve desired end. Van Royen
                                agrees that <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> can result in
                                satisfactory agreement notwithstanding several contentious issues
                                provided military situation Indonesia permits. I discussed with Roem
                                recently idea letting few reputable representatives return Indonesia
                                soon to report on conference progress and seek full cooperation from
                                authorities Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen asked me if I giving consideration <gloss target="#t_NEI1"
                                    >NEI</gloss> economic and financial troubles. I said planned
                                attend any [subcommittee] meetings this coming week and obtain
                                fullest possible data from all, sides. Reminded him of our
                                conversations Batavia and my willingness he approach me any time on
                                this subject. Told him <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                representatives Hague already pressing me on <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> revival. Hunter had talked with me again Saturday
                                morning his request and with his deputy again advancing arguments.
                                But I still thought premature any action this direction. I said I
                                especially opposed <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> suggestion of
                                sending survey group to Indonesia. Van Royen agreed this should not
                                be done. He thought someone in <gloss target="#t_ConGen1"
                                    >ConGen</gloss> Batavia could do whatever necessary when time
                                came for checking needs, deliveries, et cetera, I said would follow
                                developments closely and would not fail recommend action soon as I
                                thought it could be helpfully and safely undertaken.</p>
                            <p>Leimena and Simatupang called Sunday night. Had left Batavia August
                                20. Simatupang confident <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> can
                                control military situation accordance cease hostilities agreement.
                                Regretted what he thought nervous tendency part <gloss
                                    target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss> officials including Lovink and
                                Jacob to overstress minor incidents and expect too complete
                                compliance too soon. Explained lack coordination in <gloss

                            <p>I told visitors of vital importance peace in Indonesia to success
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>. I said possibility

                                hostilities not effective. I said I had strongly advised Netherlands
                                against any consideration such possibility and now believe it will
                                not arise if Netherlands can be assured of good intent and serious
                                efforts <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>. Simatupang said any
                                break in <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> would have disastrous
                                effect with complete loss confidence on part <gloss target="#t_TNI1"

                            <p>Told visitors unhappy reports still coming from Lovink. Said Van <pb

                                mentioned them to me and I thought he would also tell Hatta. Told
                                them I had urged Van Royen speak with them soonest. I emphasized
                                that Drees, Stikker and others all look to Van Royen for explanation
                                Indonesian developments and that failure on part <gloss
                                    target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> abide by agreements would weaken
                                Van Royen’s position and great helpfulness which he desires continue

                            <p>When I told Simatupang of Lovink’s story of infiltration incidents,
                                mentioned herein above, Simatupang ridiculed most of them. He said
                                Netherlands took serious offense at such petty matters as one group

                                Netherlands officials and Sultan only summoned hours later to appear
                                at Palace. Lovink then talked with him from 9 until 1:30 a. m.,
                                criticizing his lack of effectiveness but refusing radio equipment
                                which Sultan required for better communication with scattered
                                forces. Nevertheless, Sultan remained calm and proceeded Surabaya 4
                                hours after conversation ended to investigate complaints against
                                    <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> there.</p>
                            <p>I told Simatupang Lovink reported better situation West Java than
                                Central and East Java. Simatupang insisted this resulted from
                                personal visits by Sultan and Colonel Nasution to various parts West
                                Java and contact with both <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> and
                                Netherlands commanders. Said Netherlands military made big mistake
                                preventing Sultan from continuing visits this type and hoped
                                arrangements now working for Sultan resume personal contacts in all
                                areas. Said this only effective means for achieving best results and
                                thought unselfish and courageous efforts Sultan should be
                                appreciated. Visitors agreed my idea at least one <gloss

                                called at his request. He said he had been directed to advise the
                                Department that Dr. Hatta and his associates at the Round Table
                                Conference at The Hague believed that negotiations had reached a
                                serious <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0498"/>impasse. He said
                                that his principals were coming to believe that the Netherlands
                                negotiators were bound by the intransigence of the Dutch Estates
                                General and that it was unlikely that the Netherlands would recede
                                from its present firm position in respect of the outstanding issues
                                presently subject to negotiation. He continued to say that his
                                principals believed the Netherlands would continue to “stall” in the
                                hope that the responsibility for breaking off negotiations could be
                                imposed on the Indonesians. When asked what he believed the ultimate
                                Dutch objective might be of such tactics he replied he believed the
                                Dutch had no particular objective in mind, that he believed during
                                the past several years the Dutch had often embarked upon courses of
                                action without carefully considering in advance the end result
                                thereof.</p>

                                which negotiations appeared to have stalemated. From his reply it is
                                apparent that the Indonesians believe the unsolved problems may be

                                            members of the union. The Indonesians resist this
                                            proposal, again on the grounds it is, <hi rend="italic"

                                            and they cite the constitutional precedents provided by

                            <p>In regard to all the above points Mr. Beam and I undertook to remind
                                Mr. Soedjatmoko of the overriding importance of a continued
                                association of a real and lasting character between the Netherlands
                                and the new Indonesian state. Mr. Soedjatmoko expressed his entire
                                general agreement with our views.</p>
                            <p>In respect to point (3) of the foregoing, Mr. Beam and I tried to
                                impress upon Mr. Soedjatmoko the importance to the Indonesian state
                                of bases as a part of both short-term and long-term plans for
                                Indonesian defense against outside aggression. Mr. Soedjatmoko
                                countered with the suggestion that the Dutch might lend or lease
                                elements of their Navy to the Indonesians for the latter’s use in
                                repelling external aggression and repressing smuggling and other
                                illegal maritime activities. Mr. Beam and I did not evidence any
                                interest in this proposal. In reply to Mr. Soedjatmoko’s question we
                                assured him that the United States had made no representations
                                whatsoever to either Indonesians or Dutch concerning United States
                                interest in acquiring bases in Indonesia. I recited again the
                                Department’s desire that the Indonesians accord the Netherlands base
                                rights on a voluntary basis, pointing out that such arrangements had
                                been highly satisfactory to the Filipinos and to various members of
                                the British Commonwealth.</p>
                            <p>During the course of the conversation Mr. Soedjatmoko made two
                                interesting remarks: <list>

                                    <item>That the Dutch intention, in imposing a tremendous debt to
                                        the Netherlands on the emerging Indonesian state, was to
                                        compel the Indonesians to trade with the outside world
                                        through Holland in order to liquidate the debt. He asked
                                        point blank if the United States did not desire Indonesia to
                                        have direct access to the dollar area. We replied that this
                                        was a matter for negotiation between them and the Dutch but
                                        that speaking generally it seemed to us a sensible
                                        resolution of the problem of debt assumption by Indonesia
                                        would provide the new Indonesian state with a wide latitude
                                        of choice as between the several currency areas of the
                                        world. At the same time we made it clear that the United
                                        States could not be expected to make its policy on the basis
                                        of acquiring new members of a dollar area.</item>

                                workable arrangements consistent with sovereignty status. Neither

                                move would of course be fatal, it would, not be inconsistent with
                                policy followed by Netherlands Government in subsidizing trip of
                                American journalists to Indonesia and publishing-posthumous reports
                                which at best could only belatedly justify to some extent position

                                lost. As long as Netherlands authorities contend military situation

                            <p>As my cables have reported, I have succeeded this week in getting
                                Indonesians move considerably toward Netherlands position on
                                difficult subject of hearing “significant interests” and on vital
                                issue of union statute. I have done this since I genuinely feel
                                Indonesian position has been unsound on significant interests and
                                not in harmony with spirit Linggadjati and <hi rend="italic"

                                point of negotiation, I am convinced I shall have to press <gloss

                                    >RTC</gloss>, this would be disastrous. In fact, hope any
                                communiqué following Stikker’s conversations Washington will contain
                                no reference to <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> issues.</p>
                            <p>Following on Netherlands bases: Would refer only to possible
                                retention by Netherlands of “naval” bases in Indonesia.
                                Inter-Indonesian conference August 2 contained recommendation that
                                ^’Netherlands armed forces (KL) should be entirely withdrawn from
                                the Republic of United Indonesia”. Since failure second police
                                action and obvious necessity Netherlands transfer sovereignty
                                soonest, am doubtful whether agreement would be accepted by
                                Indonesians permitting military garrisons after certain date.
                                Considering small number military forces that Netherlands could
                                afford to leave in Indonesia, doubt real value thereof if any attack
                                against Indonesia by third party. Foreign military instructors will
                                be required. Believe we must however look to Indonesians themselves
                                to police country, protect <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0503"
                                />foreign interests and defend their land. Would be especially
                                cautious any commitment our part this time favoring retention
                                Netherlands armed forces in Indonesia considering bitterness of
                                Republic on this subject and tendency Netherlands to exaggerate

                                that might be expected therefrom. Unwilling give final and definite

                                        substantive questions. The pace is slow. The Indonesians
                                        should not be hurried. If they want to move faster, the

                                    <item>The Indonesians are hyper-sensitive in matters of
                                        sovereignty, and inclined to sacrifice workable solutions to
                                        an excessive care of prestige. The Netherlands are
                                        constantly watchful not to hurt their feelings, but it must
                                        remain our fundamental purpose not to accept paper solutions
                                        which, in the aggregate or separately, are certain to bring
                                        about chaotic conditions in an exposed part of the world

                                        sovereignty should not be too difficult so long as both

                                        without <hi rend="italic">any</hi> settlement having been
                                        reached. It will be necessary to watch this dangerous

                            <p>The key to obtain a more cooperative attitude on these very important
                                points on the part of the Indonesians, though nominally resting with
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>, rests in point of fact
                                with the United States Member. The Indonesians will remain difficult
                                and distrustful, but it will make a very great difference when the
                                United States Member of <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> tells
                                them that he cannot subscribe to their methods or to the stand they
                                take.</p>
                            <p>It may be recalled in this connection that, especially in the earlier
                                stages of the controversy, the Government of the Republic has always
                                pressed for an arbitral decision. The reason was that they wished to
                                be able to say to those of their followers who, like the armed
                                elements, were disinclined to obey them, that they had done their
                                best, but that a solution had been imposed on them by an agency
                                other than the Netherlands. Similarly, any reasonable outside
                                persuasion will strengthen the hand of the Republican Government,
                                not weaken it.</p>
                            <p>In the eyes of the Netherlands Government, the art of diplomacy in
                                this matter consists for all concerned in finding the boundary where
                                recognition of the claims of Indonesian nationalism and generous
                                concessions to those claims degenerate into solutions which, so far
                                from promoting stability in this corner of South East Asia, sow the
                                seeds of economic disruption and political disintegration.</p>
                            <p>Another failure in the negotiations would be a serious setback for
                                the western powers in general and for the Netherlands in particular.
                                It is not likely that, given the peculiar character of the
                                Indonesians, it will be possible for the Netherlands without some
                                outside help to avoid failure despite anything the Netherlands
                                Government can and will do within the limits of a tense internal
                                political situation and of the revised Constitution.</p>
                            <p>There are four specific areas of contention which will present
                                serious difficulties:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Union</hi>. The Indonesians are very
                                    suspicious that the Netherlands aim at a super-state with powers
                                    of its own, so as to impair Indonesia’s newly won
                                    sovereignty.</p>
                                <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0505"/>
                                <p>The Netherlands have no designs of this nature, since for obvious
                                    reasons they are no more in favor of a super-state than are the
                                    Indonesians.</p>
                                <p>In the opinion of the Netherlands, the Netherlands–Indonesian
                                    Union is not to be a super-state, but a form of close
                                    cooperation between two independent sovereign states.</p>
                                <p>This Union must have machinery for consultation of ministers in
                                    equal numbers from both states and an interparliamentary
                                    consultative committee.</p>
                                <p>If a decision is arrived at in these consultative bodies, the
                                    governments remain responsible to their respective parliaments
                                    and not to any organ of the Union.</p>
                                <p>There should be a Union-tribunal for the amicable settlement of
                                    disputes between the partners to the Union. The judges are to be
                                    appointed in equal numbers by both states. In case of dead-lock,
                                    the President of the International Court of Justice should
                                    appoint one more member.</p>
                                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Finance</hi>. The Indonesians are naturally
                                    unwilling to assume for their new State a greater portion of the
                                    debt of Indonesia than is warranted.</p>
                                <p>The Netherlands wish to be generous in this—as in other respects;
                                    the settlement they have in mind is as follows:</p>
                                <p>A. Debts incurred before 1942 to be recognized in full.</p>
                                <p>Interior debts since 1942: the same; a devaluation is
                                    unavoidable, in consequence whereof these debts should not be
                                    too heavy a burden.</p>
                                <p>Exterior debts since 1942 to be negotiated with the Netherlands
                                    for a broad settlement with due regard to the economical
                                    possibilities of both states. As Indonesia is in the near future
                                    going to be a borrowing country this settlement will give
                                    reasonable prospects of repayment of new loans.</p>
                                <p>B. Permanent consultation with the Netherlands in the management
                                    of the national bank and currency control, and an appropriate
                                    voice therein so long as Indonesia remains heavily indebted to
                                    the Netherlands.</p>
                                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">New Guinea</hi>.</p>
                                <p>Although New Guinea is a backward area which ethnographically and
                                    biologically does not form part of Indonesia and formed part of
                                    the Netherlands Indies merely in the interest of administration,
                                    the Indonesians claim its western half (the eastern half is
                                    under a trusteeship by Australia). By any standard, it is
                                    incapable of governing itself. There would be more justification
                                    for Indonesia to claim North Borneo or Malaya than any part of
                                    New Guinea.</p>
                                <p>It is the set purpose of the Netherlands Government that New
                                    Guinea remain under Dutch control so as to offer the best
                                    guarantees for expert improvement and development of this area
                                    in conformity with the principles of Chapter XI of the Charter
                                    of the United Nations.</p>
                                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Military</hi>.</p>
                                <p>The line of defense in the Far East against communism needs some
                                    bases: Hongkong, Philippines, Singapore and Surabaja.</p>
                                <p>The naval base in Surabaja can only be run by the Dutch Navy. For
                                    the foreseeable future the Indonesians have no navy.</p>

                            <p>An arrangement on these lines should be acceptable to the Indonesian
                                delegation. It is doubtful whether this arrangement offers adequate
                                guarantees to prevent chaos, but less than this would lead in a few
                                months to Burmese conditions.</p>

                                we believe from our contacts, based fundamentally on belief or fear

                                that Cochran should apparently feel that he will have to exert great
                                pressure “to see that Indonesians get square deal” in financial and
                                economic settlement. We have <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0507"
                                />felt Indonesians are in driver’s seat this matter and that great
                                persuasion probably would be necessary insure Indonesian agreement
                                to economic financial terms which are both fair to Dutch and of
                                character to induce continued ready availability of foreign capital
                                and technical skills to Indonesia. We doubt whether Dutch in event
                                treatment they consider unfair are going to send good money after
                                bad and continue in large numbers to devote their undoubtedly great
                                talents and experience to Indonesian development. We believe,
                                therefore, that it in interests of both parties and of wider US
                                interests in that area that economic and financial arrangements
                                arrived at <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> are generally held to
                                be fair and reasonable to both sides.</p>

                                discussion with Secretary and, quoting his verbal note on necessity
                                US intervention to prevent Indonesians wrecking conference. In light
                                these two indications of divergent positions, I feel Department
                                should understand strongly conflicting attitudes represented in
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and problems that naturally
                                ensue.</p>
                            <p>Only accomplishment at Namur was progress on smoothing out most
                                difficult problems on Union statute but feel this entirely
                                worthwhile if decisions taken there adopted by respective
                                delegations Hague. These concerned principally (1) character Union
                                statute, (2) meetings between representatives of Union partners, and
                                (3) position and function of head of Union. Each delegation had
                                separate draft document on Union statute. Working committee had made
                                some progress.</p>
                            <p>In two sessions in which I participated Namur negotiations
                                considerably more complicated as result presence <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> than when working with Roem and Van
                                Royen alone Batavia. Anakagung, while competent, made things
                                exceedingly difficult for Netherlands delegation since less
                                experienced and more sensitive and suspicious than Republican
                                leaders and also harassed by large delegation lacking discipline and
                                understanding of international negotiations. <gloss target="#t_BFO1"
                                    >BFO</gloss>, far from being “stooge” of Netherland delegation,
                                is more resistant than Repulican delegation. Maarseveen
                                unfortunately has offended both Indonesian delegations by his
                                naturally forceful and impetuous manner in conferences, announcing
                                decisions as taken before Indonesians really aware what going on.
                                Van Royen and I have had to plead with Hamid and Anakagung not to
                                by-pass Maarseveen since he is one who has to convince government
                                and then Parliament of acceptability any agreement reached.
                                Indonesians complained to me of attitude Drees in Saturday morning
                                meeting since they found him more difficult to deal with than Van
                                Royen alone and since he inclined frequently <pb n="496"
                                    xml:id="pg_496" facs="0510"/>to state that if he yielded further
                                his government could not succeed in getting agreement ratified. In
                                both Saturday and Sunday meetings of small group, I emphasized
                                necessity both Netherlands and Indonesian groups realize political
                                problems of other and strive fairly for workable agreement that
                                could be ratified by all.</p>
                            <p>Not submitting Union statute working papers at present stage and feel
                                not worthwhile recount various problems of drafting met and dealt
                                with Namur. Am happy report, however, that in almost every instance
                                suggestion which I brought forth after others had argued their
                                positions was accepted. Of troublesome points which were considered,
                                there was only one sentence dealing with decision to be taken by
                                Union which was not resolved and was left for consideration Hague.
                                Will require time and effort get decisions taken Namur agreed to by
                                delegation Hague. For instance, on one point Anakagung was so
                                difficult we finally had three drafts which Netherlands would accept
                                and left choice of one thereof to his delegation, including his own
                                draft to which a time schedule had been added by me. Just before
                                leaving Namur, he wanted know if he could take what he wished from
                                each of three drafts. Delegations meeting separately today. Tuesday
                                morning working group from three delegations meet on Union statute.
                                No chance having consolidated draft Union statute before end week
                                but if progress made at Namur confirmed and continues, outlook is
                                satisfactory. Roem and Anakagung promised help straighten out
                                “significant interests” problem steering committee Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>I do not subscribe to belief that impasse be reached or that either
                                side “is willing”. Positions are so divergent and interests at stake
                                so important that negotiations difficult and tedious, particularly
                                with large delegations including many inexperienced Indonesians.
                                Hard for <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> help as unit since
                                Critchley definitely marked as advisor to Republicans and not
                                trusted by Netherlands and Herremans found so ineffectual that
                                rarely consulted even by Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>I shall not attempt comment on separate points raised by Stikker and
                                Soedjatmoko. Several of their observations obvious to Department as
                                unduly biased while others already out of date by progress made.
                                Notwithstanding troublesome and dangerous factors involved, I feel
                                satisfactory settlement can be worked out if <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> left alone to follow such plodding course as that
                                adopted Namur. Van Royen suggested to me last night we have weekend

                                matters are negotiated to point where final decisions necessary.
                                Serious problems will be faced there as will also on New Guinea. For
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> or its members to endeavor
                                prepare draft solutions in advance would not be wise. Each
                                delegation already has much drafting prepared and feels it must
                                present this and <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0511"/>its

                                help in resolving differences when negotiations between parties
                                approach exhaustion. My position not easy as only <gloss

                                meetings. Unless I am strictly objective, my usefulness ends. I have
                                much contact with various leaders and appear have confidence Hamid
                                and Anakagung well as leaders Netherlands delegation and Republican

                            <p>I met again with above-mentioned group of 9 at 9 am today. Found <pb

                                for translation one word which confident can be settled.</p>
                            <p>At ensuing meeting steering committee, I was asked make following
                                announcement: “Through informal discussions held since return of
                                their steering committee from Namur, 3 delegates have agreed in
                                principle on following points re union statute: (1) Character of
                                union statute; (2) Position and functions of head of union; (3)
                                Duties and composition of conference of ministers of union partners
                                which are to be held at regular intervals; (4) Duties and
                                composition of court of arbitration of union; (5) Good contact and
                                regular cooperation between parliaments of union partners”.</p>
                            <p>It was agreed that foregoing should be issued in press release. Our
                                group of 9 arranged one member from each delegation, namely Supomo,
                                Blom and Anakagung, should continue work on union statute and
                                endeavor have full coordinated draft thereon by end next week. Also
                                requested they endeavor complete draft of charter for transfer
                                sovereignty. Believe after achieving above described agreement that
                                remaining points in union statute will not cause too much
                                difficulty.</p>

                                support this hypothesis Neth Amb read memo, later handed to Asst Sec

                                ground foregoing memo, characterized situation as extremely serious
                                and suggested that Repub Govt, which he said had been cooperative,
                                should be convinced of seriousness situation to the end that it
                                would, abandoning attitude of indolence and fatalism, make resolute

                                Asst Sec’s question Neth Amb was at pains to make clear that Lovink
                                considered trouble arose from activities extremist elements in the
                                field and not from intentional lack of cooperation on part Jogja

                            <p>In answer further question by Asst Sec, Neth Amb stated that in his
                                view Repub Govt Jogja was able impose requisite discipline if

                                Neth Amb went on to say that Neth Govt had prepared note, which he
                                described as entirely friendly in tone, to Repub Govt asking that
                                latter take energetic steps to repress activities extremists and
                                offering cooperate with Repub Govt to that end. Neth Amb said that

                                me what should be done. I considered it urgent we get results
                                shortly on debt settlement and financial agreement. I regretted
                                publicity which was making negotiations more difficult. I said that
                                if we could not soon report success on union statute and financial
                                problems world would look pessimistically on <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss>. I said I had not discussed with my government, my

                                idea I was going “try out” on them in accordance request from both
                                parties I take helpful initiative. I said purely personal and
                                probably would not please either delegation.</p>
                            <p>I said was convinced Netherlands would not wipe out debt for
                                extraordinary military expenses as such or reduce total debt to
                                figures stipulated by Republicans. I said I could understand
                                political difficulties Netherlands Government but convinced they
                                must reduce by greater figure than offered. I said place to reduce
                                was on state-to-state <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0520"/>debt
                                and place to give service respite was on bonds and Netherlands
                                guaranteed foreign credits. I said Indonesians themselves should
                                have responsibility for internal debt. I said my whole thesis was
                                that no matter how carefully we draft and how long we talk over
                                amounts and plans nothing would be of avail if <gloss
                                    target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> does not succeed. I said we had to
                                go limit in making sacrifices all sides to get plan that will
                                work.</p>
                            <p>I said concerned over burden Indonesia will have initial period. I
                                was against their trying do whole thing through foreign borrowing,
                                particularly if they have their exchange from exports pledged to
                                considerable extent. I said if they assume too heavy borrowing load
                                they could never emerge from morass of indebtedness. I said they
                                would have to conduct Spartan economy at best. I knew Hatta, Hamid
                                and others realized they could not make go of it unless they looked
                                to Netherlands for technical assistance and aid. I thought they
                                might also desire consult International Bank or Fund. I said be most
                                difficult get new government started under conditions which have
                                been inherited. Said would like see termination discussions on
                                finance and debts soonest with generous attitude and sacrifice both
                                sides. I thought this would do much to show world union partners are
                                going to shoulder and share burden as business partners. I then read
                                text memo. I added that at Baarn I had suggested there might be
                                group of experts selected to look into settlement as long-term
                                proposition with only general lines agreement to be reached <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>. I reminded Stikker he had told me
                                definitely his government could not accept such suggestion but
                                wanted whole problem settled now. I said Hatta had spoken with me of
                                this same expert group idea but I realized it futile.</p>
                            <p>In discussion that ensued I said I did not have knowledge of
                                contracts under which US credits outstanding in total under
                                reference but would try get this reduced if possible.</p>
                            <p>When Djuanda asked re tin pledge, I gave explanation in first
                                paragraph this message. I said Netherlands had sought “agreement” on
                                Indonesian financial aid related matters well as tin pledge and
                                setting aside percentage foreign exchange from exports. I said they
                                were willing waive “agreement” if obtaining “consultation.”
                                Furthermore my recommendation did not include export percentage
                                arrangement. I was therefore favoring tin pledge as above indicated
                                although from standpoint Indonesia procuring needed new loans from
                                abroad realized this would be handicap. I said had received tin
                                pledge descriptive document which I had requested at Baarn only last
                                night and had not yet studied it carefully. Van Royen spoke of heavy
                                load plan would oblige Netherlands carry coming four years. Stikker
                                said if they cannot come to compromise with Indonesians no hope of
                                solving problem but difficult Netherlands accept whole my plan and
                                go on giving credits.</p>
                            <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0521"/>
                            <p>I thought unwise attempt monetary purge now. Said if we could get out
                                announcement of broad-minded settlement with mutual sacrifices more
                                favorable atmosphere would be created for any debt consolidation or
                                monetary operation. There would be more confidence in monetary
                                future and currency unit that Indonesia is to utilize. I said happy
                                agreement and good press would improve chances for domestic and
                                foreign support.</p>
                            <p>Hatta and Djuanda spoke of deficit budgetary situation inherited and
                                said actual debt between 10 and 12 billion rather than between 6 and
                                7 as Netherlands figures utilized by me indicate. We pledged secrecy
                                and early study my paper since Stikker and other ministers leaving
                                next Wednesday for Luxembourg. Was agreed suggestion would be
                                discussed with limited top colleagues and group would inform me
                                whether they found paper basis for any further discussion. If so, we
                                would meet again secretly my quarters. Meeting was entirely
                                cordial.</p>
                            <p>At end Steering Committee meeting 4:30 p. m., Stikker asked if I
                                would be available in evening. I said 5 o’clock meeting on union
                                statute but would be in quarters thereafter. Made real progress in
                                meeting with one from each delegation on union statute and all of us
                                confident we could get this satisfactorily completed first of next
                                week. On call from Stikker I went directly from meeting to residence
                                Prime Minister 8 p. m. where talked with Drees and Stikker alone for
                                hour and half.</p>
                            <p>Drees said Finance Minister Lieftinck insisted my suggestion
                                impractical and he unwilling assume responsibility therefor. Said
                                few members government had talked over situation and thought
                                inevitable government tender resignation. Said intended telegraph
                                Netherlands Embassy Washington to report situation to Department. I
                                said had already informed Department, had made suggestion to group,
                                and had let Department know of impasse and of request from Stikker
                                that I push matters and his receptiveness to idea of my getting
                                group together and giving my suggestions. I said I had not cabled
                                text, preferring wait see whether group willing accept it as basis
                                for discussion.</p>
                            <p>Drees and Stikker took turns telling how difficult their situation
                                was politically and financially and how my suggestion now made their
                                going on in government and <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>
                                impossible. I reviewed figures with Stikker in endeavor convince him
                                margin of charge to Netherlands thereunder as compared with their
                                plan advanced Baarn should certainly not be considered as
                                constituting item to make government resign. I said they must
                                realize <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and world would not
                                consider this satisfactory reason for government falling and <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> failing.</p>
                            <p>Drees then referred to unfavorable reports from Indonesia. I said
                                aware of them just as I had been familiar with other fears which
                                Netherlands had held over Indonesian problems. I said casualties <pb
                                    n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0522"/>had ceased and was
                                confident situation could be worked out once <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> ended and Indonesian leaders return from Hague to
                                Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>Stikker said my suggestion not only unacceptable as basis negotiation
                                but would make impossible get Indonesians accept anything less since
                                they have seen it. I said I never sounded out either party in
                                advance when requested offer compromise formula. I reminded him he
                                had been one to urge me most strongly get Hatta into negotiations
                                some way, had made no suggestion himself for basis thereof and
                                Netherlands oral note following Baarn gives no lead. Only answer he
                                had was that his people could show costs military operations much
                                less than Indonesian figure mentioned 700 or 800 million as correct.
                                Department knows this ridiculously low.</p>
                            <p>When both Drees and Stikker reiterated necessity cabinet resigning, I
                                said this absolutely foolish. I said I had worked with their
                                government through lot of difficulties and was willing go ahead and
                                help get fair settlement now but did not desire participate in
                                agreement which would leave such burden on Indonesia that I, with
                                some little technical experience, was absolutely sure would not give
                                Indonesia ghost of chance of either succeeding or surviving. I said
                                I would gladly discuss my suggestion with Lieftinck or any their
                                experts. I repeated I had not submitted my suggestion to Department
                                and had not acted under any instructions. I said I was acting on own
                                responsibility but entirely happy have my government review my
                                suggestion.</p>
                            <p>I said naturally regretted if any well-intentioned moves my part
                                upset them. I insisted suggestion had been purely informal and that
                                I would not even have circulated copies if Van Royen had not
                                requested this or if any one of group had opposed suggestion going
                                beyond oral stages. I reminded them that suggestion had only been
                                advanced as possible basis for discussion and group members were to
                                let me know before Sunday whether they accepted it as such basis. I
                                would, however, seek withdraw memo with explanation I had been given
                                understand it was not acceptable as basis for Sunday’s
                                discussion.</p>
                            <p>When Stikker spoke rather strongly of alleged harm I had done, I
                                recalled to him many services I had performed for him and his
                                government. I said he and Drees had volunteered to me last February
                                that Netherlands did not have manpower and money to carry through
                                second police action. I said they realized well as I that course we
                                have taken under <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> directive only
                                possible way out. I said I had taken whole responsibility on <gloss
                                    target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> side in spite warnings from
                                friends that Netherlands Government might walk out when situation
                                got tight and blame <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and US
                                particularly therefor. I said I had never believed this and could
                                not believe for one minute now that government would quit and invite
                                chaos and Communism in Indonesia.</p>
                            <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0523"/>
                            <p>I said optimistic over chances new state if only can be given
                                breathing spell. Said intended proceed Department immediately after
                                termination <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and help obtain
                                financial assistance needed to give Indonesia fair start. Said I
                                would likewise be interested and active in seeing Netherlands
                                supported during difficult period. Thought better that both partners
                                to union seek outside aid rather than Netherlands look to Indonesia
                                for payment of debts and interest during critical stage and oblige
                                foreign lenders largely finance Indonesia including debt service to
                                Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>When I spoke of willingness intercede for both partners, Drees and
                                Stikker became interested. I said I had not favored any
                                understanding between Netherlands and US Government before or during
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> on what settlement should be
                                or what assistance could be expected from US later. They then said
                                would proceed with cable to Ambassador Washington and needed my memo
                                as basis thereof. Said might ask me talk with Lieftinck and others.
                                Said we should not, however, have Sunday meeting or endeavor
                                negotiate on financial problem in <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> next few days.</p>
                            <p>I spoke with Hatta by phone when he became available 11:30 p. m. Told
                                him suggestion had been found unacceptable as basis further
                                discussion and I would see him 10 a. m. Saturday for return of memo.
                                Asked he inform Djuanda and keep strictly secret. Endeavored contact
                                Hamid. Unsuccessful but will try later.</p>
                            <p>Suggest Department review <gloss target="#t_OIR1">OIR</gloss> report
                                No. 4947 of Aug. 17 on Indonesian public debt which I have used

                            <p>909. <gloss target="#t_Hicus1">Hicus</gloss> 54. Reached Hamid by
                                phone 7:30 this morning. Told him understood my memo unacceptable as
                                basis negotiation financial settlement. Consequently I desired
                                withdraw it and would see him 10 o’clock for this purpose. I asked
                                he inform Indrakusuma.</p>
                            <p>At 10 o’clock received by Hatta with Djuanda present. We had <pb

                                us. I said Drees and Stikker had informed me Lieftinck found my
                                suggestion impossible and could not take responsibility therefor.
                                Consequently Netherlands considered suggestion unsatisfactory as
                                basis for negotiation and I offered withdraw memo. I said there
                                would be no Sunday meeting. Was handed back four copies my memo. All
                                four Indonesians expressed keen regret this development and
                                appreciation my effort. Hatta and Hamid said memo was by no means
                                one-sided but represented middle course which involved
                                inconveniences and hardships for them. Hatta said had asked Minister
                                Goetzen explain budget figures for Indonesians and had found them
                                not at all convincingly in support Netherlands attitude. Hatta said
                                financial and monetary situation so bad, including budget deficit,
                                that unless at least as reasonable plan as mine can be agreed, upon
                                by Netherlands, he, Hatta, might as well suggest sovereignty be
                                transferred directly to Communists rather than first to his
                                group.</p>
                            <p>All four said lead from me had been only hope out of deadlock. Said
                                they were unable make any offer above that submitted Baarn and
                                Netherlands gave no indication of yielding from their position. Said
                                work of military and other main committees well as all
                                sub-committees in financial and economic field will be held up
                                pending solution vital point debt settlement and financial
                                arrangement. Said conference will definitely break down if we cannot
                                therefore move out of this impasse. Hamid said even some members
                                Netherlands delegation indicate lack sympathy with official position
                                taken Baarn. For example, Hamid said, he was asked last night at
                                dinner given by Blom how financial negotiations were progressing.
                                When he said outlook unsatisfactory, Wisaksono, Agriculture and
                                Fisheries Secretary of State in provisional Federal Government and
                                member its delegation to <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> working
                                with Netherlands delegation, said absolutely impossible <gloss

                                Four Indonesians promised keep my suggestion and developments
                                thereon secret. I made no mention to Indonesians of possibility
                                resignation Netherlands Government.</p>
                            <p>Hatta said if Netherlands will not accept my suggestion, only way out
                                is for conference to work on other matters and leave financial
                                settlement in suspense for investigation by international group.
                                Hamid thought Netherlands would still oppose latter idea and that no
                                settlement on other points such as taking care of Netherlands
                                military withdrawals could be achieved in absence overall financial
                                agreement. Saw Van Royen this noon my request. Told him desired
                                withdraw his copy my memo. He said he would consider null and void
                                but had given copy someone else. I reviewed last night’s talk with
                                Drees and Stikker. Also asked he tell Stikker I had seen four
                                Indonesians this morning and had received their copies. I summarized
                                my talk with Indonesians, stressing Hatta’s worries.</p>
                            <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0525"/>
                            <p>Van Royen said he had participated in meeting last evening with small
                                Cabinet group that preceded my meeting with Drees and Stikker. Said
                                aside from conviction that Parliament would not accept my idea of
                                settlement Cabinet members themselves thought it more than they
                                could recommend. He volunteered that Drees gave disproportionate
                                importance to submission suggestion. Said Drees felt however that he
                                would have to resign rather than ask Parliament approve such plan
                                after promises he has made that further Netherlands sacrifices for
                                Indonesia would not be necessary. I said I did not question Drees’
                                sincerity but did not see that resignation Cabinet would help
                                anyone. Van Royen even more positive on this point, saying
                                resignation not warranted and would hurt Indonesia well as
                                Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Stikker sent word to me in Van Royen’s office that Lieftinck desired
                                see me Tuesday morning with Goetzen present. I agreed. I asked Van
                                Royen if this meant there would be no precipitate government action.
                                He said he thought there would not unless something might “blow up”.
                                I assured him Indonesians had pledged secrecy to me. He said Stikker
                                also wanted me to know he and Maarseveen had decided cable report to
                                Washington of all dangerous factors Indonesian situation and
                                seriousness Netherlands Government attaches thereto. Sending

                                making Indonesians realize they cannot get complete wiping out of
                                debt arising from police actions and other causes considered by them
                                “not to benefit of people of Indonesia” and making Netherlands
                                realize it is to their own interest give Indonesian financial
                                settlement that will not impair sovereignty, but will be politically
                                acceptable and so fair as to afford <gloss target="#t_USI1"
                                    >USI</gloss> reasonable chance to succeed.</p>
                            <p>Positions assumed by parties in Baarn talks and adhered to succeeding
                                days revealed divergency that could never be eliminated by normal
                                inter-party negotiation. Conscious of this and urged by leaders in
                                three delegations and most of all by Stikker to take initiative, I
                                personally ventured suggestion which I knew did not take care joint
                                    <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0527"/>Indonesian
                                determination not to pay extraordinary military debts and which I
                                fully realized would be considered drastic by Netherlands. I thought
                                time had come to let Stikker know it is out of question for me
                                support Netherlands cause to extent he would like and is imperative
                                Netherlands demonstrate more generosity in financial field if they
                                are to have successful <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and
                                viable union.</p>
                            <p>I did not expect either side accept my hurriedly put together plan as
                                such but did hope it might—and still hope it may—get them started on
                                realistic talks toward debt solution, etc. Stikker now has arranged
                                for me to meet with Lieftinck and Goetzen Tuesday morning and Van
                                Royen has intimated Netherlands still look to me to help them get
                                out of impasse. With two Netherlands Ministers I will not of course
                                insist on my own plan, especially since Drees said it not acceptable
                                as basis. I will put burden on them of suggesting something better
                                and at least find out whether they are ready move in any helpful
                                degree toward middle ground agreement. I may even ask them give me
                                plan whereunder they think Hatta government could handle finances of
                                    <gloss target="#t_USI1">USI</gloss> during first four years and
                                seek their assurance they would be willing undertake its
                                implementation if chosen as responsible officials for this purpose.
                                If Lieftinck cannot see light, he might make way for more
                                constructive realist.</p>
                            <p>At this point should recall that Stikker and Hirschfeld were most
                                insistent to me on early monetary purge Indonesia while Jacob has
                                let Dow know he would resign if such adventure attempted. Hirschfeld
                                admitted to me that Hoogstraten and other economic and financial
                                officials <gloss target="#t_NEI1">NEI</gloss> Government are not
                                “one hundred percent” and would have to come out. My point is that
                                Netherlands officials here are not sound in their ideas as to what
                                should be done to take care of internal debt situation Indonesia and
                                that Netherlands officials there aside from Jacob are not likely be
                                great help.</p>
                            <p>Unless Netherlands may move fairly far in giving relief on lines
                                comparable to these I have suggested, believe Hatta will adhere
                                demand international group study problem and only general lines of
                                financial settlement be included in <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> agreement. If Netherlands then does not accept
                                this, result will be deadlock. If <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> or member thereof makes compromise proposal to
                                Netherlands, danger would be risked of Drees Ministry falling rather
                                than take responsibility for asking Parliament make more
                                “sacrifices,” to use Prime Minister’s words.</p>
                            <p>In negotiations Indonesia and here Netherlands always allege Hatta
                                unable take responsible decisions and unsure of support. Evident
                                here Netherlands negotiators themselves in difficult position
                                self-made by Netherlands. For instance, Stikker and Van Royen told
                                me <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0528"/>Baarn Netherlands offer
                                reduction debt could be raised from 500 to 700 million but not more
                                since decision had already been taken by government in liaison with
                                Parliament that this would be maximum. Stikker told me Cabinet had
                                just completed plans for next budget to be in balance which counted
                                on interest from Indonesians on state to state debt, consequently
                                this could not be reduced as I suggested. In my conversation with
                                Drees and Stikker, Prime Minister found my suggestion unacceptable
                                since he said he had given pledge to Parliament further sacrifices
                                in favor Indonesia would not be sought from them. Difficult believe
                                reduction by another billion or two would mean sacrifices by
                                Netherlands anything like comparable those Indonesians have suffered
                                already and would bear in monetary purge wiping out at least
                                two-thirds remaining value of currency after 30 percent devaluation
                                few weeks ago.</p>
                            <p>With Stikker and few other Netherlands ministers absenting themselves
                                most this week, little prospect early progress on financial problem.
                                Stikker and Van Royen told me hoped we could talk on other matters
                                and leave financial problem dormant few days. With Indonesians
                                realizing Baarn talks meant deadlock, I consider unlikely much
                                advance can be made in related or most other committees until
                                settlement debt and financial problems in prospect. Some Indonesians
                                already pressing for return home and Hatta himself may find it
                                imperative go unless outlook entirely favorable by end two month
                                period <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>, that is October 24, for
                                early successful conclusion. With Hatta gone, hopes for achieving
                                results would diminish.</p>
                            <p>Situation is therefore that unless Netherlands willing soon accept
                                realistic arrangement on debts, conference hopelessly deadlocked. If
                                Drees Cabinet resigns on financial or other <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> issue, then <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>
                                ends. If government falls on financial issue, feel Netherlands would
                                have very poor case before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. While
                                Republicans would of course report <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>, I am sure they would not remain Hague after conference
                                breaks down but return Indonesia. Believe Indonesians will insist on
                                sovereignty January 1, 1950 whether transferred by agreement with
                                Netherlands for union or whether Indonesians take their own decision
                                and declare themselves entirely independent. <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> following inter-Indonesian conferences Jogja and
                                Batavia has provided really pre-sovereignty convention for

                                smoothed out their divergent views and coordinated their policies

                            <p>Sukarno and Sultan in meantime have widened authority Indonesia. With

                                really strong organization <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0529"
                                />throughout greater part Indonesia could be realized. Stikker took
                                pains assure me in conversation with Drees that Netherlands planning
                                no third police action. My feeling is that next police action more
                                likely come from Indonesians if conference fails. Prior cease
                                hostilities agreement, Netherlands spread troops widest possible
                                Indonesia and in agreement insisted on maintenance such outposts and
                                patrols. Instead proving element of strength, this has made
                                Netherlands forces more vulnerable. Through cold infiltrations
                                    <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> and Republic sympathizers
                                evidently now have created situation where Netherlands forces would
                                be dangerously threatened and might conceivably be annihilated if
                                new action should come.</p>
                            <p>I do not seek Department approve plan which I suggested. I do
                                recommend however that if and when Van Kleffens approaches
                                Department he be made clearly understand danger to conference that
                                is resulting from Netherlands inability see problems as they are and
                                to pay price of extra one or two billion guilders required get
                                workable solution. Stikker returned from US with belief American
                                opinion towards Netherlands has been greatly improved by ill-fated
                                journalists and by convening <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>. I
                                have never been able reconcile Netherlands alleged determination
                                transfer sovereignty soonest and unconditionally with attempt
                                convince US through publicity agents and otherwise that Indonesians
                                incapable self-government. Sovereignty likely pass to Indonesians
                                Jannary 1 whatever Netherlands does. Circularizing friendly nations
                                by Netherlands re their fears and troubles will not stop it. If they
                                desire have sovereignty transfer within union, should treat
                                Indonesians as partners and not seek tie them up like bad debtors
                                and deprive them support essential to live.</p>

                                still safeguard political position each party. Indonesians have been
                                no stiffer these negotiations than Netherlands. On contrary, have
                                been more willing endeavor expedite conclusion. Maarseveen as
                                chairman last week was definitely not helpful at Thursday night
                                meeting and I so commented to Van Royen afterwards. Meeting tonight
                                at 9 with drafting group of three. This should indicate whether
                                agreement on entire statute can be reached.</p>
                            <p>When Drees and Stikker told me Friday night Indonesians were delaying
                                discussions most committees and disrupting conference, I said
                                Indonesians made almost same allegation to me re Netherlands
                                tactics. I said I had opinion and had so reported to my Department
                                that neither side was stalling but that both faced with difficulty
                                decisions on matters vital importance. I told them I shared their
                                view Palar had been disconcerting influence and I had lectured him
                                thereon. I said key to situation was for Netherlands approve
                                financial settlement bearable Indonesians. I thought once this
                                accomplished, <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> could be wound up
                                in comparatively short time. Without such step I feared
                                consequences.</p>
                            <p>When Stikker and Van Royen talked with Beam and me, we assured them
                                Beam would do everything possible upon arrival Batavia to help
                                achieve better order. Believe, however, Netherlands raising this
                                issue to undue height. Believe <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss>

                                Fact that various groups have affiliated with <gloss

                            <p>916. Called on Stikker his home yesterday asking him bring me
                                up-to-date recent developments <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>,
                                particularly the indications to Cochran of likelihood Cabinet will
                                resign. Said to him could not understand how Cabinet resignation
                                this juncture could possibly serve Netherlands’ interests Indonesia
                                or at home, on contrary, could only lead disaster, and asked for
                                explanation of reasons for entertaining such.</p>
                            <p>Stikker, after reviewing recent negotiations, said, in effect, that
                                Cochran’s recent personal proposals had had practical effect of
                                setting limits beyond which Indonesians would not go and which
                                Cabinet could not possibly recommend to Parliament. The difference
                                between them remained so great Cabinet could see no solution and
                                therefore felt impelled resign.</p>
                            <p>Said to Stikker my personal opinion last thing Cabinet should do was
                                resign this juncture after six months’ patient negotiation and close
                                approach acceptable agreement. Felt that record, as far as I knew
                                it, would not show that all possibilities of financial-economic
                                agreement had been exhausted. On contrary, thought parties had
                                largely sparred for position thus far, and that world would quickly
                                come that conclusion if breakdown occurred and record made
                                public.</p>
                            <p>Stikker replied that Netherlands’ Cabinet was getting to point where
                                it did not care what world thought. There was such a thing as being
                                pushed too far. Cabinet had been through 15 months sustained
                                pressure, with severe internal stresses and strains on all important
                                decisions, constantly subjected to party criticism and intrigues
                                (which had led to departure of Sassen and Beel) and now was
                                confronted with whole new series of internal problems incident to
                                devaluation. In these circumstances, and with Netherlands’ foreign
                                assets sadly diminished and country running large trade deficit, it
                                should occasion no surprise if Cabinet felt unable recommend further
                                staggering sacrifice. Should be remembered that Netherlands’
                                Government has been financing Indonesia since war and that
                                Government has promised Parliament an early end to this drain.
                                Holland was in difficult financial position close to end its
                                resources, and point had been reached where it could not agree
                                assume added burdens beyond its strength to carry and in face great
                                uncertainties.</p>
                            <p>Cabinet fully aware that breakdown <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> meant chaos Indonesia and probably Holland (where
                                stoppage <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> might ensue) but felt
                                they were confronted with such decision. Added with touch of
                                bitterness <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0532"/>that
                                Netherlands’ Government and people felt (and he cited talks with
                                Hatta past week by himself, Hirschfeld and others indicating
                                fundamental basis understanding existed) that real conflict is
                                between US and Netherlands and not Indonesia and Netherlands.
                                Supported that by stating only on that ground could he understand
                                repeated US refusals support Netherlands’ proposals, however
                                reasonable, or indicate clearly what solution it would support.
                                Added that any Dutch proposal seemed be regarded with suspicion by
                                Indonesians and <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> regardless of
                                merits.</p>
                            <p>I replied was extremely difficult for any country play impartial role
                                (as US is) particularly when both parties wanted support of that
                                country; that American Government had repeatedly demonstrated its
                                readiness accord tangible friendly aid to Netherlands and approval
                                of declared objectives Netherlands in Indonesia which seemed on
                                point realization.</p>
                            <p>Stikker acknowledged these arguments, but added that time had come
                                when more postive US support for workable solution was imperative.
                                Said he had had definite impression that Netherlands’ approach to
                                financial solution was regarded as sound and that Netherlands had
                                been taken by surprise by Cochran proposal cancel two billion
                                Indonesian floating debt to Netherlands’ Government. Stikker
                                proceeded criticize “fantastic” Indonesian calculation. In oral note
                                following Baarn meeting (of Netherlands’ military expenditures at
                                Indonesian cost as 3.7 billion guilders) some 100,000 soldiers at 30
                                guilders per day (and deduction thereof from 6.3 billion total debt)
                                said resultant 2.6 billion implied further. Netherlands’
                                contribution 1.7 billion to Indonesia after cancellation 1.5 billion
                                (though 1.7 billion presumably would be reduced by internal purge
                                measures).</p>
                            <p>I commented my understanding Netherlands’ insistence upon final
                                settlement debt question at <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and
                                said this seemed, imply drastic cancellation inter-government debt
                                if Indonesian Government to carry burden remaining debt in difficult
                                years ahead. Personally did not understand such insistence when
                                financial position so difficult and outlook so obscure. Would have
                                thought it wiser to make generous cancellation for military
                                expenditures and postponed decision on balance for three or four
                                years with agreement now that international commission experts
                                should then recommend or decide fair solution. Stikker pondered this
                                for some time, but did not react, and finally said Cochran would be
                                discussing whole question with Lieftinck and Goetzen on Tuesday.
                                Stikker was at pains to make clear that while he felt Cochran did
                                not fully appreciate difficulties confronting Netherlands’
                                Government, that Netherlands’ Government was not criticizing Cochran
                                and had faith in his intentions and confidence that he would do
                                utmost to resolve dilemma.</p>

                            <p>Came away from meeting with feeling that Stikker had given vent to
                                his feelings, as he is prone to in tight positions, and that, having
                                done so, now, with colleagues, anxiously awaits compromise proposals
                                that will save day. They are thoroughly alarmed both at
                                deteriorating situation militarily in Indonesia and at recent
                                tendency of Indonesians here to harden and even withdraw from
                                previous understandings. Their real hope is that US may find it
                                possible to advance suggestions that both parties can accept with

                            <p>The Netherlands Ambassador left with me today the attached note
                                concerning Indonesia.<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">Not
                                    printed.</note> He asked that it be brought to your personal
                                attention.</p>
                            <p>The note states the concern of the Netherlands Government arising
                                from reported infiltrations of Republican troops in Java, which the
                                Dutch regard as violations of the truce. While admitting that there
                                has been a sharp decline in the use of armed forces, the Dutch note
                                states that as a result of infiltrations the civil administrations
                                in various parts of Java are being ousted by the military and that
                                the regular Republican forces are being greatly augmented by
                                extremist elements which are not subject to the control of the
                                Republican Government. In the opinion of the Netherlands Government,
                                this situation has resulted in an inability or unwillingness on the
                                part of the Indonesian delegation at The Hague Conference to enter
                                into binding commitments with the Dutch, because of fear that they
                                will not have the political power to make these commitments stick.
                                In his oral remarks, Ambassador van Kleffens stressed his
                                government’s fear that the control of the Republican Army was
                                shifting to radicals who might turn out to be communists.</p>
                            <p>The note states that the Netherlands Government has done all in its
                                power to persuade the Republican leaders to take a stand against
                                this trend in Indonesia, without avail. It requests the U.S.
                                Government <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0534"/>to attempt to

                                        responsibility urged Republican Minister Interior, who is
                                        powerful internal politician, to restrain local Republicans

                                    <item>In speaking to Minister Interior, I stressed concern was
                                        over administrations locations which might interfere with
                                        supply and consequently affect cease fire order. Seriously
                                        doubt whether <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> or US
                                        representatives should go further at present. There is
                                        danger that we might place ourselves in position of
                                        defenders of <hi rend="italic">negaras</hi> which have no
                                        roots in population and whose governments are staffed either
                                        with those permanently identified with old Dutch rule or
                                        persons whose Republican sympathies are transparent, [as]
                                        was clear at least in Pasundan during recent visit there.
                                        The <hi rend="italic">negara</hi> problem is likely to be a

                            <p>I did not oppose idea Indonesians being responsible for pre-war
                                consolidated debt of 900 million and foreign credit of 400. I
                                considered, however, no chance Indonesians accepting proposal if no
                                more than 700 million to be cancelled. Netherlands argued this was
                                really total of extraordinary million [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >military</hi>] expenditures involved. I said irrespective basis
                                of calculations, this amount would not give adequate relief from
                                debt burden to permit Hatta succeed with USIP [<gloss
                                    target="#t_USI1">

                            <p>Netherlands finally suggested arbitration committee with Indonesians
                                having one vote, Netherlands one and neutral to be selected <pb
                                    n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0537"/>by both one vote, be set up
                                to determine amount extraordinary military expenditures. Lieftinck
                                would undertake recommend to his Govt and to part [apparent garble]
                                reduction of total debt by amount of such expenditures as
                                established by arbitration committee. Negotiations would then take
                                place directly between parties on debt service to be worked out on
                                remainder debt to Netherlands. Again I argued all planning would be
                                no avail if Indonesians should be burdened with unbearable load of
                                obligations. Netherlands conceded provide escape clause in
                                settlement which would permit Indonesians raise question through
                                conference of union ministers in event Indonesians find debt burden
                                unbearable. Netherlands unwilling, however, leave overall settlement
                                figure open, feeling definite agreement must be reached <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>In agreement with Netherlands, I called immediately on Hatta. I told
                                him Lieftinck willing sound out his cabinet and liaison members
                                Parliament on personal plan of debt settlement if Hatta and top
                                Indonesians thought it could be accepted as basis negotiation. In
                                understanding with Netherlands, I did not give Hatta details debt
                                service scheme or mention amount of credit line. I simply put up
                                idea Indonesians assume entirely responsibility consolidated debt
                                and foreign credit; arbitration committee determine on basis
                                extraordinary war expenditures amount floating debt should be

                            <p>Hatta told me Hirschfeld called on him yesterday trying work out some
                                plan. Hatta had proposed only general financial agreement be made at
                                conference with total for settlement left open to be determined
                                subsequently by international study group. Hirschfeld had offered
                                consider this but was sure his people preferred definite settlement
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and would look upon Hatta’s
                                scheme only as last resort. Hatta said personally willing accept
                                Lieftinck plan as basis discussion and was sure Djuanda would agree
                                with him. Said he would consult Hamid and Indrakusuma and let me
                                know at three o’clock steering committee whether they would go along
                                with idea. He said I could tell Netherlands at once that he
                                personally favored his basis for negotiations. I proceeded Minister
                                Finance. Lieftinck absent but I reported results to Goetzen. He said
                                he and Lieftinck lunching with Maarseveen and he would inform his
                                colleagues.</p>
                            <p>In my conversation with Hatta and as I reported to Netherlands, I
                                insisted that Indonesians should not consider plan which I had

                            <p>In my talks with Netherlands, I gave no commitment that I considered
                                interest and amortization schedule. I said much would depend upon
                                size to which debt reduced and on which schedule would apply. At
                                steering committee Hatta told me Djuanda approved Lieftinck idea as

                                phoned Lieftinck this information 5 p. m. He said he had discussed
                                matter with PriMin and Stikker and had their approval. Suggested I
                                carry on from this point with Stikker. Phoned latter who confirmed

                                phoned Hatta who said he would try have answer for me when I attend
                                union statute meeting his hotel this evening.</p>

                            <p>Talking with Hatta and Roem this forenoon, I urged their approval of
                                last night’s drafting on statute, emphasizing how much it would help
                                on vital financial-economic issue if union statute and charter out

                                and Indonesian Djuanda. Said Maarseveen and Stikker were to consult

                                with him for only ten minutes following lunch, and Stikker then left
                                with group for Luxembourg. Said three of them agreed ask me be third
                                man on arbitration committee. Hirschfeld had not yet been consulted,
                                being absent in Luxembourg, but Netherlands assumed he would accept.
                                I said I would do whatever parties agreed upon as helpful, but would
                                insist that terms of reference for our committee and consequences of
                                its decision be defined specifically before task undertaken. I had
                                asked Van Royen how far details of Lieftinck’s overall plan had been
                                disclosed to Indonesians. He was not sure on one or two points and
                                phoned Maarseveen in my presence, but still could not clear up all
                                questions for me.</p>

                            <p>812. For Butterworth eyes only. Beam, in first formal interview with
                                Lovink lasting over hour, received full treatment and was given
                                darkest view re present situation here described as critical.
                                Doubtless this intended produce desired effect provoking pressure on
                                Republicans but at same time consider that comments highest
                                responsible resident Dutch official must be given due account.</p>
                            <p>According Lovink, Republicans being forced to yield pressure
                                extremist nationalist elements composed leftist <gloss

                                    target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and Darul Islam, all stated to be
                                leagued together according developing Communist plan. Republicans
                                described as being persuaded political necessity of making
                                concessions now to these influences with hope they may later master
                                them when sovereignty achieved. Lovink considered this vain hope
                                since extremists apparently gaining control. Doubted Republican and
                                federation Hague delegates informed true situation.</p>
                            <p>Lovink said Djocja Sultan called on him this morning present virtual
                                ultimatum demanding withdrawal and concentration Dutch forces in
                                residencies and districts throughtout Java, including <hi
                                    rend="italic">negaras</hi>. Sultan silent on question present
                                police remaining but Lovink thought latter would stand little chance
                                against <gloss target="#t_TNI1">TNI</gloss> which would move in.
                                According Lovink, Sultan stated Republicans could no longer be
                                responsible avoidance serious incident in event non-acceptance his
                                proposal made with full Republican authority. Lovink told Sultan he
                                could not consider proposal which he would have to transmit his
                                government. Said he had not yet reported his government pending
                                meeting this evening his military staff to consider status whole
                                question cease-fire and local administrative arrangements.</p>
                            <p>In reply repeated suggestion, Lovink stated matter too basic to be
                                referred to <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> deputies and
                                military observers here since this would lead to taking of positions
                                and press leaks. Insisted he required highest government
                                instructions. Said had obtained Sultan’s promise no publicity,
                                impressing on him seriousness repercussion in <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss>. In reply further questioning and
                                warning against precipitate action, Lovink said Dutch military would
                                take no overt military steps and he acknowledged his course to be a
                                move to gain time and to obtain possible withdrawal Republican
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>Some of Lovink’s statements to Beam completely out of line best
                                information here, such as assertion 15,000 Tan Malaka and 15,000 <pb

                                together West Java. Lovink asserted several times absolutely nothing
                                to be done here for moment since situation would soon become matter
                                for governments. It appears his aim to make it so, taking advantage
                                of seemingly extravagant and precipitate Republican demands. Put

                                Cochran. For sake future relationships Dutch here, request this be
                                observed. Lovink adamant insisting bypassing local <gloss

                                delivered Assistant Secretary contains series of general statements
                                which appear to be partially based on understandable concern
                                regarding present Netherlands tactical situation, but also contains
                                exaggerated view of political situation which has always existed in
                                some measure within Republic. It has always been known that there
                                are strong elements professing allegiance to Republic which have
                                been opposed to securing of independence by negotiation rather than
                                force of arms. These groups may be either rightwing or leftwing in
                                character, but they have not refused their support to Republic
                                Government in its policy of negotiation at Hague and, despite
                                frequent verbal expressions of impatience, have not created any
                                disturbances. Republican leaders have always so far been able to
                                handle these elements and to allege now that Republican
                                administration under Sukarno and Hatta is either so weak or so inept
                                that it is allowing itself to be undermined by extremist elements is
                                equivalent to bringing into doubt entire basis on which conference
                                Hague is being conducted and on which US has in past lent its
                                support, with other nations, to Republic at Lake Success.</p>
                            <p>It is, of course, true that any undue delay in <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> settlement would play into hands of
                                those who criticize Hatta Government for policy of peaceful
                                negotiation with Dutch. Budiardjo said today, for instance, that
                                political critics are becoming more vocal and <gloss

                                    facs="0542"/>impatient and that considerable sentiment exists
                                within Jogja Government for adjourning <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> and continuing it in Batavia after very brief
                                recess to allow travelling time, such adjournment to take place

                                concluded by October 31. This solution not regarded as ideal and
                                only being suggested as possible way out if <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> cannot be concluded within next two or three

                            <p>When Netherlands request to Department is analyzed, it appears that
                                we are being asked to make strong high level approach to Republican
                                Government on basis of vague allegations which would almost
                                certainly be instantly denied by Republicans and identified by them
                                with Netherlands military intelligence of which we would then be
                                thought to be the spokesmen.</p>
                            <p>Have spoken with Beam and Abbey at length concerning this question,
                                importance of which is recognized by all of us. Suggested to Beam
                                and Abbey that since they intend in any case to proceed Jogja
                                Tuesday in order pay formal call on Sukarno, excellent opportunity
                                exists to review entire situation with President, bringing into

                                late Saturday night, gave me his account views day’s events. After
                                meeting his advisors, <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0545"
                                />decided not report Sultan’s demands to Hague Friday but to have
                                further discussion with him hope he would withdraw them. This
                                occurred Saturday morning. Sultan’s proposal as contained annex and
                                oral explanation in essence was that Dutch Military begin withdrawal
                                to regencies and residencies all Java, receiving communications
                                corridors which Republics would likewise use. Lovink rejected
                                pointing out lack guarantees for police and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >negara</hi> Administrations. Claims Sultan acknowledged his
                                demands contrary cease-fire agreement. As concession Lovink then
                                indicated willingness to make beginning applying Republic plan
                                certain agreed areas. Said Sultan rejected insisting acceptance
                                total plan needed avoid incidents. Lovink then said must report
                                Hague which he did Saturday night. I mentioned Republic assurances
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> delegation strict orders
                                against opening fire. Said Sultan’s proposal might be maneuver

                                consternation caused by Dutch concentration and withdrawal in

                                here. Lovink said he had given such orders but doubted Republic
                                ability restrain extremists. I mentioned consternation caused by
                                Dutch sweeps and indiscriminate arrests infiltrees which Lovink at
                                first denied. He agreed, however, order his commanders review arrest

                                to do with Neth desire to retain bases since it was his information
                                that <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s would not accord Neth
                                bases under conditions which his Govt would regard as practical.
                                When asked if considerations he had set forth would be placed in
                                different light if Neth and <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>s
                                agreed on Neth retention of bases, Neth Amb replied that it did not.
                                As his answer seemed illogical, further questions were directed at
                                Neth Amb which resulted in his reading portion of his tel
                                instruction some phrases of which revealed that Neth Govt wished to
                                seek US, UK and Australian expression of their interest in Neth
                                retention of bases and Neth continuance maintenance security at

                            <p>Asst Sec asked Neth Amb if, in view Brit interest in protection trade

                                Neth Amb replied that telegram he recd had been repeated to Neth Amb
                                London and Canberra. Asst Sec took this occasion to tell Neth Amb
                                that Dening had left him and other officers under impression that

                                last evening and sought my ideas on “self-determination”,
                                particularly for areas which Republican claims but under
                                Netherlands’ control since second police action. I mentioned New
                                Guinea problem. Van Royen advanced idea application being made to UN
                                for Netherlands’ trusteeship over specific number years. Said action
                                on application would require perhaps one year and situation could be
                                better judged within that time.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen phoned again 10 p. m. Said Cabinet seriously concerned over
                                reports from Indonesia and was issuing statement to effect it
                                supported position taken by Lovink. I said conditions Indonesia made
                                it all more urgent we rush conference to termination. Van Royen
                                agreed.</p>
                            <p>Roem phoned 11:30 p. m. Said Republicans just finished meeting with
                                    <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> and thought they had “terms
                                reference” that would be satisfactory for small committee. Arranged
                                I should get details this morning.</p>
                            <p>Called on Roem 9:30 a. m., he translated from document in Indonesian

                                    would be decided by committee of 3 to be set up by Netherlands
                                    appointing one member, Indonesians, second, and 2 members to
                                    choose third. Their decisions would be binding.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>I asked Roem if small committee would definitely have authority to
                                fix full terms debt settlement. He said this was his understanding.
                                I said Indonesians anticipating negotiations by excluding tin
                                pledge, etc. Roem still thought terms would be acceptable
                                Netherlands. In answer my query, said Indonesians had not yet
                                informed Netherlands of terms. Asked me convey them to Van Royen. I
                                said I would act as intermediary only to point of getting
                                Netherlands directly in touch with Republicans through Roem or
                                Djuanda.</p>
                            <p>As I was leaving I said if we could once get financial problems
                                settled, I was sure conference would end successfully. Roem said we
                                would still have New Guinea. I asked what he thought of Netherland’s
                                trusteeship. Roem pled for transfer sovereignty to include New
                                Guinea with understanding negotiations be entered subsequently with
                                Netherlands and foreign countries perhaps through UN as to how New
                                Guinea should be handled. He opposed trusteeship in lieu transfer
                                sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>Called Foreign Office and shortly received by Stikker, Van Royen and
                                Hirschfeld. I gave them information on Indonesian terms reference.
                                Van Royen argued tin pledge essential. Stikker agreed with me that
                                Lieftinck had not included this in five points his original
                                memorandum which had provided basis my first approach to Hatta and
                                Stikker’s subsequent talk with Hatta at luncheon. When Van Royen
                                urged necessity of security, I said I had not argued one way or
                                another but stressed importance to Indonesians of honoring
                                contracts, whether any revenues pledged, if <gloss target="#t_USI1"
                                    >USI</gloss> to have credit standing. Said exacting of pledge in
                                partnership arrangement might be questioned. I said pledge certainly
                                insufficient ground for breakdown negotiations on financial
                                settlement upon which entire success <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> depends.</p>
                            <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0549"/>
                            <p>Stikker thought hopeless try get question terms reference for
                                committee worked out in time for action by steering committee this
                                afternoon. Van Royen suggested Stikker see Hatta soonest. This was
                                not immediately possible since Drees talking with Hatta on
                                Indonesian situation. I urged and Netherlands trio agreed Hirschfeld
                                should see Djuanda at once and get Indonesian terms reference
                                directly from latter in Dutch and not depend upon my message as
                                official. I said Hirschfeld and Djuanda should discuss terms with
                                Hirschfeld raising any objections Netherlands desired and Djuanda
                                being given chance explain or seek amendments. I recommended further
                                that Hirschfeld report back promptly to Stikker and latter still see
                                Hatta before steering committee meeting and endeavor get terms
                                reference agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>Upon leaving meeting Van Royen told me Stikker and he had been
                                meeting with Maarseveen and entire government considered Indonesian
                                situation critical. I said we all recognized some deterioration. I
                                reminded him, however, that he and I had seen no alternative but
                                follow course we had in line with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                directive. I stressed urgent now every one keep steady and finish
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> in few days. I thought
                                conservative leaders here could handle situation once returned to
                                Indonesia with successful agreement. I cautioned Van Royen against
                                taking Lovink too seriously, reminding him of Lovink’s tendency to
                                see Communists in every shadow. Van Royen assured me he was mindful
                                thereof. Signed Cochran.</p>

                                brought to Steering Committee. Consequently debt item eliminated

                                statement referring remarks Sultan Jogja 14th on grave situation.
                                Said Sultan had given <gloss target="#t_HRC1">HRC</gloss> plan of
                                “dislocation of troops” which meant concentration Netherlands troops
                                in main cities with Netherlands having strips of communication
                                between which would have to share with <gloss target="#t_TNI1"
                                    >TNI</gloss> on notice from latter. Said Sultan and <gloss
                                    target="#t_HRC1">HRC</gloss> had agreed no publicity should be
                                given to discussions thereon but Sultan had revealed details in
                                public statement. Alleged Sultan acted in contradiction actual
                                situation and moreover in contravention Article 17 Chapter II of
                                “Netherlands–Indonesian Manual for Implementation Cessation
                                Hostilities”.</p>
                            <p>Van Royen continued Netherlands’ authorities had been concerned since

                                infiltrations and the contravention. Said <gloss target="#t_HRC1"

                                being negotiated and which were turned down. Van Royen concluded by

                            <p>Hatta replied saying he had no advance notice of this sudden move on
                                part Netherlands’ delegation and would appreciate having copy
                                statement before replying thereto. Said he would not object to
                                matter being referred to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in which
                                Indonesia has much confidence. Chairman Hamid suggested copies be
                                given all delegations well as <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>.
                                I do not yet have text.</p>
                            <p>As <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> chairman, I raised question
                                of procedure whether <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> should
                                act simply as agency of transmittal at request either party. I said
                                both parties have permanent representatives <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> through whom they may submit any statements they
                                desire. I said I appreciated confidence Hatta and Indonesians in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> but doubted reference matter
                                to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> this juncture would have
                                helpful effect. I said <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>
                                deputies doing everything possible cooperate Netherlands and
                                Indonesian officials to steady situation and achieve best possible
                                compliance with cease hostilities order. I said our duty at Hague is
                                to bring <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> successfully to close
                                and I thought it would be great reflection on all of us if we failed
                                after approaching our goal so closely. I appealed to parties get
                                together and discuss situation rather than ask <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> bring matter under present
                                reference to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> attention. I said
                                long debate there probably not help conclusion <gloss

                            <p>Van Royen replied appreciatively of my pagt and present efforts reach
                                settlement. He insisted, however, that Netherlands’ delegation has
                                obligation inform <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> of situation and
                                that less upset would result if <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> transmitted communication rather than Netherlands’
                                representative <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> submitted it
                                directly. He said <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> could let
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> understand immediate
                                consideration of statement not required.</p>
                            <p>I countered that <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> itself
                                ordinarily determines when it should make reports to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. I said we planned none on <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> until successfully concluded. I
                                said we desired be available for extending our good offices and even
                                making recommendations to parties if their own negotiations threaten
                                breakdown. I personally hoped report would not be insisted upon
                                unless and until such situation arose and <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> intervened. I said in any event I would have to
                                consult my <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> colleagues on
                                matter of procedure but definitely felt <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> should not simply transmit Van Royen’s statement
                                and perhaps Hatta’s answer without commenting thereon. Furthermore,
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would not be prepared
                                comment thereon without seeking and obtaining full report from
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> deputies Indonesia. Van
                                Royen continued insistence <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>
                                should be medium transmittal.</p>

                            <p>After meeting adjourned, informal debate continued between,
                                Maarseveen, Van Royen, Hatta, Anak Agung, Roem, Critchley, Herremans
                                and myself. Critchley and I held out that if Netherlands’ delegation
                                desired send statement to <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> we
                                would seek Hatta’s comments thereon and then inform both parties
                                what we intended to do. Our immediate idea was that we should do
                                nothing until we had sought and received report from Batavia. Van
                                Royen argued we should send statement to <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> with explanation that report would follow and
                                statements required no immediate attention. We refused accept
                                responsibility for any remarks to effect whatever we turned in did
                                not require early attention. Discussion closed with my telling both
                                parties I thought they were wrong to cast doubt on success <gloss
                                    target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> by bringing complaint to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> this juncture but <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would of course consider whatever
                                requests submitted to us.</p>
                            <p>Netherlands desired include in Steering Committee communiqué
                                information to effect both parties were giving statements to <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> in good spirit for bringing to
                                attention <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. I opposed such
                                publicity, saying this would give cause for speculation and doubt
                                and hurt chances of conference. Finally agreed make simple statement
                                in communiqué that committee had given careful consideration to
                                Indonesian situation. Indonesians were downcast over surprise move
                                by Van Royen, Pringgo Digdo for instance remarking to me this move
                                might mean end of Union.</p>

                                thought military situation both sides could be held in check.
                                Referred to report he had received that announcement would be made

                                Indonesia but would gladly have some stay as advisers. He expressed
                                bitterness re artificial <hi rend="italic">negaras</hi>, claiming

                                Sukarno himself had perhaps been too modest in not wishing to boast

                                Said it inconceivable that Indonesians would jeopardize through lack

                            <p>973. Called on Stikker this morning to discuss latest Indonesian and
                                    <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> developments. Found him
                                extremely tired, discouraged, and rather apathetic.</p>
                            <p>Stikker began by saying he thought he sensed Indonesians might be
                                “backing down” a little, although he could point to nothing very
                                tangible. Said Netherlands Government felt events beginning take
                                course which Netherlands powerless to influence. He had given
                                repeated warnings of developments which have come and had sought
                                outside assistance in preventing them but without avail. Netherlands
                                Government had no intention of making any further <hi rend="italic"
                                    >démarche</hi> and would have to accept whatever came.</p>
                            <p>He said he thought rift was developing between Hatta and Sultan
                                Jogja. The latter was proving in his view to be opportunist.
                                Netherlands had been surprised that Sultan with his background had
                                early espoused Republic cause when it was clearly extremist
                                movement. Now, with clear sense of impending events, Sultan was
                                espousing and seeking assume leadership of extremist wing Republican
                                movement (Stikker feared Hatta might well lose ascendency).</p>
                            <p>Stikker professed great discouragement <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> prospects in view of week’s loss of time in getting
                                small financial committee to work. He had gone Luxembourg Conference
                                last week believing all agreed. Netherlands proposal (Lieftinck
                                plan) had aimed at short cut to enable successful completion of
                                conference this month. Present efforts to broaden terms reference,
                                he feared, would doom committee to failure complete work in few days
                                remaining. Indonesians giving many indications intention return
                                Indonesia end of month while he and Hirschfeld must go to Paris for
                                    <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> October 27. He said
                                Indonesians, particularly Djuanda, bore heavy responsibility for
                                delaying tactics. He referred to Netherlands Government <hi

                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> which would jeopardize <gloss

                                Netherlands position a matter of record; as they might have to raise
                                matter later.</p>
                            <p>Impression gained from Stikker was that Netherlands have not given up
                                all hope that something might yet be salvaged from conference; but
                                that they are discouraged, somewhat embittered and beginning to show
                                signs of confusion. Government obviously does not know what to do if
                                impasse comes. They will not ask for it but they are undoubtedly
                                hoping against hope that the US will at the last moment intervene to
                                save the situation.</p>
                            <p>In latter connection, British Ambassador called last night for
                                discussion and reported talks with Stikker and Cochran under
                                instructions from Bevin. Ambassador said as result these conferences
                                he would be making certain suggestions his Foreign Office. This

                                near at hand. Cochran is doing masterly job but he may need
                                Department’s help at last moment.</p>
                            <p>Embassy has watched carefully development and evolution of Dutch
                                feelings on Indonesian crisis and wishes to emphasize once again the
                                strength and depth of underlying Dutch sentiments that the course
                                they have followed the past six months has been taken because the US
                                advised and, in fact, desired and insisted upon it. Dutch feel they
                                have made a genuine, generous and, all out effort to reach agreement
                                    <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0557"/>and that if there is
                                failure, it is because the Indonesians have felt that they have
                                American backing in this conflict and can reach agreement on their
                                own terms. In these circumstances Embassy believes that breakdown of
                                conference and resultant deterioration of conditions in Indonesia
                                would have the inevitable result in the Netherlands of an outburst
                                of bitterly anti-American sentiment and other consequences which it
                                is hard to foresee. As for Indonesia, we have been repeatedly told
                                by high Dutch authorities that if they are forced to withdraw their
                                armed forces from Indonesia under conditions of a breakdown of
                                efforts to reach peaceful conclusion, there inevitably will be an
                                immediate great exodus of Dutch nationals, in fear of their lives,
                                regardless of the effect this will have upon their property
                                interests. This, of course, would be catastrophic for Indonesia, not
                                to mention the damaging effect upon Holland’s overall economic
                                position.</p>

                                        Soekarno had issued a conciliatory and optimistic statement,
                                        which the Netherlands attributed to our influence. The
                                        Netherlands Counselor said that while it was too early to
                                        see the effect of Soekarno’s statement, he personally
                                        believed that it would ease the tension in Java. He thanked

                                morning 29th. Said question New Guinea would be difficult. Said

                                Netherlands Government considered question too delicate to leave to
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>. He personally thought
                                trusteeship answer. I said had not discussed question with
                                Indonesians for some time and did not know just how they felt.</p>
                            <p>I have revealed no one my knowledge Netherlands had approached

                                keeping New Guinea colony. I thought advisable, however, let Van
                                Royen know how I was likely act if my opinion sought either
                                independently or through <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>, lest
                                he feel we had not been fair with Netherlands following their
                                representations Washington. Consequently I said I preferred idea
                                leaving Netherlands sovereign over New Guinea for present with
                                stipulation negotiations be entered into by Netherlands and <gloss

                                to decide future status. I agreed with Van Royen that long period
                                would result in strife and uncertainty, with little likelihood for
                                investments, et cetera. I preferred period of not more than two
                                years or better one year. This would not exclude possibility
                                trusteeship being advocated by Netherlands when negotiations opened.
                                I said could not, of course, anticipate what <gloss

                                11:30 morning 29th. As we were assembling Pringgo Digdo said Sukiman
                                has just returned from trip Indonesia and stressed necessity New
                                Guinea being included in transfer sovereignty, even if special
                                arrangements had to be made whereunder Indonesians would leave much
                                to Netherlands. Pringgo said he planned remain Hague few days after

                                representatives remain four or five days after close <gloss

                                would be glad to give him any help during those days or perhaps for
                                day or two longer.</p>
                            <p>In meeting was agreed chairmen of three delegations and <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> would give maximum five-minute

                                be invited as part of public. Republicans refused accept Netherlands
                                idea of Indonesian and Netherlands High Commissioners taking
                                precedence over Ambassadors. Will have status of Ambassadors but
                                nothing more.</p>
                            <p>Question of observation implementation <gloss target="#t_RTC1"
                                    >RTC</gloss> agreements arose. Indonesia favored <gloss

                                sovereignty would be to supervise military matters and elections or

                                Guinea. Indonesian argued original text transfer sovereignty which
                                Netherlands promised must include New Guinea and that this was
                                envisaged by Linggadjati. Netherlands replied they had realized
                                impossibility population New Guinea expressing its desires
                                accordance with Article 3 Linggadjati and had consequently made
                                reservations thereon. Hatta said must consider Netherlands East
                                Indies one entity and one unit from which no part should be
                                separated. Saw no reason why independence should be granted <gloss
                                    target="#t_RIS1">RIS</gloss> if New Guinea was not to be
                                included. Said Linggadjati meant much to Indonesians and that
                                principles expressed in Article 3 should not be considered nullified
                                by statements of Van Mook or any other Netherlands official. Said
                                since people of New Guinea not yet ready speak their own minds, New
                                Guinea should continue part of whole <gloss target="#t_NEI1"

                            <p>Maarseveen stopped debate after three hours with blunt statement
                                Netherlands Government could not transfer sovereignty over New
                                Guinea to <gloss target="#t_RIS1">RIS</gloss>. Said he knew this
                                statement would be painful to Indonesians and particularly <gloss
                                    target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss>. Said if Indonesians willing accept
                                sovereignty without New Guinea, this did not mean <gloss
                                    target="#t_RIS1">RIS</gloss> would be deprived of hope acquiring
                                New Guinea later, but this should not be interpreted on other hand
                                as encouraging such hope. Maarseveen promised Netherlands would not
                                transfer New Guinea to any third power. Furthermore, Netherlands
                                would not place New Guinea under trusteeship or grant autonomy
                                thereto without consulting <gloss target="#t_RIS1">RIS</gloss>. Said
                                this was very definite position Netherlands Government. Meeting
                                adjourned until 9:30 p. m.</p>
                            <p>As night session assembled Hamid told me Indonesians had in meantime

                                    >UNCI</gloss> but Netherlands refused. He urged <gloss

                                speaker. Said <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> appreciated
                                difficult position Netherlands Delegation and Netherlands
                                Government. <gloss target="#t_BFO1">BFO</gloss> had reviewed

                                position it had indicated. He said Anak Agung had shown how

                                would regard Netherlands attitude as set forth by Maarseveen. Supomo

                            <p>After session Van Royen spoke with <gloss target="#t_UNCI1"
                                    >UNCI</gloss> trio. Said feared Netherlands Government could not
                                accept our suggestion. We told him Maarseveen had given Indonesians
                                serious shock by his announcement at end afternoon session. It
                                appeared conference would break down unless compromise found on New
                                Guinea. We said not opposed Netherlands trusteeship and thought our
                                plan might even result in such arrangement within one year. Van
                                Royen asked [<hi rend="italic">added?</hi>] Maarseveen had
                                approached Indonesians with suggestion trusteeship and had offered
                                try get his government’s approval thereof if they were receptive.
                                Indonesians opposed. We pointed out our plan close to Netherlands
                                idea. That is, no transfer sovereignty over New Guinea now but
                                question of status to be resolved by discussions within one
                                year.</p>
                            <p>Maarseveen and Van Royen said Netherlands Government and Parliament
                                desired complete and final Indonesian settlement now. Both men
                                thought Indonesians would continue agitation until New Guinea in
                                their possession and would bring pressure on Netherlands <pb n="554"
                                    xml:id="pg_554" facs="0568"/>as end first year approached. We
                                insisted Indonesians have more opportunity or [<hi rend="italic"

                                    >RTC</gloss> is at stake and thousands Netherlands troops in
                                Indonesia than they would have after achieving sovereignty and
                                Netherlands troops withdrawn. We hoped several months of Union
                                partnership would make both partners appreciative dependence upon
                                each other and that really happy solution could be worked out in
                                specified time. When Maarseveen told how critical Romme was becoming
                                of agreements, <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> trio offered
                                talk with him if Maarseveen thought this would help. Again we
                                envisaged possibility that within one year Indonesians might
                                themselves come to idea of trusteeship.</p>
                            <p>Maarseveen said Netherlands Delegation would have serious conference
                                on New Guinea before this afternoon’s meeting. He feared question
                                self-determination would also cause trouble. As indicated above,
                                Netherlands Delegation has submitted draft which calls for agreement
                                between parties on recommendation to be made to <gloss

                                    >RTC</gloss> agreement. Indonesians will oppose this on ground
                                their draft provisional constitution provides for self-determination
                                and that sovereign <gloss target="#t_RIS1">RIS</gloss> will take

                                2:30 a. m., 31st, with two-hour recess for dinner. Prior session I
                                talked with Hamid who said Indonesians so far found impossible
                                withdraw from positions indicated on New Guinea. He favored
                                acceptance <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss> compromise. I spoke
                                with Anak Agung, Eoem and Sastroamidjojo, urging them not let <pb

                                pictured great results Indonesians were achieving and future ahead.
                                I said could make no promise what decision on New Guinea might be
                                year from now but felt they should go home with success now gained
                                and depend on later negotiations for determination New Guinea. I
                                said was convinced Netherlands would not move beyond <gloss

                                and let <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> collapse.</p>

                                    <item>Dutch have made many far-reaching concessions in face of
                                        violent domestic opposition, by the public, in the press,
                                        and among political leaders. As a result, it is now
                                        generally felt throughout the country that because of their
                                        great sacrifices Dutch are running great risk of being
                                        reduced financially and economically to status of a Denmark.
                                        We have indicated publicly that in solution Indonesian
                                        problem independence Indonesia is one of two objectives, the
                                        other being preservation of Holland as a going concern. Many

                                        independence have taken precedence over Holland’s future

                                        economically and financially how can she play her part in

                                    <item>Present Dutch Cabinet is coalition of uneasy bedfellows
                                        thrown together in summer 1948 after six weeks of no
                                        government. There are already signs of strain between two
                                        most prominent parties (Catholic and Labor) and it is
                                        possible that coalition government will dissolve. If Cabinet
                                        falls a scapegoat will be sought and the US might well be

                                        This, however, at present remains under cover as Dutch
                                        recognize and appreciate large measure of assistance given

                                        economic assistance and projected military aid.
                                        Nevertheless, we fear that once Holland is no longer

                                at the international bar, despite, in their opinion, their firm
                                belief that Dutch handling of Indonesian problem if unhampered by
                                outside interference would have been fully justified by results and
                                that Indonesian independence should not have been established
                                without guarantees of stability in Indonesia and of undamaged
                                economic and financial position of Holland. They believe that they
                                have bowed now to international opinion and pressure and have loosed
                                Indonesia prematurely without any firm guarantees as to Indonesia’s
                                stability or Holland’s future strength. The Dutch are sore and we
                                fear that this resentment will be aimed at us. They think they have
                                had enough castigation and therefore I urge that a bouquet be given

                                been discussed at length. Said areas under reference would soon find

                                to complete copies and translations.</p>
                            <p>Excellent spirit pervaded close of session with congratulations
                                exchanged. Stikker and Van Royen especially cordial in their thanks
                                to me as were Indonesians. This was first session for Stikker to
                                attend recently as he had been absent Paris He said Hoffman told him
                                there that arrangements made to resume <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> aid to Indonesia soon as agreement reached. I
                                confirmed had recommended Department issue statement to this effect
                                soon as <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> successfully concluded.
                                Stikker said any kind deeds and words we could offer soonest would
                                be most appreciated.</p>
                            <p>Upon returning from session I found <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> Hague had phoned that Hirschfeld’s office had

                                resumption of aid released. Have not had opportunity discuss this

                                and people of Indon, which will lead to the increasing prosperity of

                            <p>Netherlands Government gave dinner last night presided over by Prime

                                friendly and excellent spirit prevailed. Speakers of three
                                delegations all expressed appreciation assistance <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>, particularly our policy of

                                offer solutions when called upon as difficulties arose.</p>
                            <p>After dinner, Drees, Stikker, Maarseveen and Van Royen were very kind
                                in thanking me personally. Drees said he knew I had always been
                                optimistic and said he now optimistic for first time. Indonesians
                                likewise appreciative. Roem and Simatupang leaving this evening for

                                    facs="0577"/>go. Before dinner, Simatupang told me he pleased
                                with progress made outside <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> past
                                few days on military matters. Said principles of agreement concluded
                                whereunder Netherlands troops will be withdrawn from certain area
                                toward concentration points prior transfer sovereignty. Said
                                Netherlands not yet agreed to complete withdrawal from <hi
                                    rend="italic">Renville</hi> territories by transfer but
                                Simatupang still hopes this can be achieved. Said suggestion had
                                been made that Secretary State for War Fockema Andreae proceed
                                Indonesia shortly to consummate and supervise these arrangements.
                                This official has been found sympathetic and realistic by
                                Indonesians who would welcome his visit warmly.</p>
                            <p>After dinner, Stikker asked what I thought should be done immediately
                                in Indonesia. I told him first move should be to send Fockema. As
                                Van Royen and I came home he said Drees and Stikker had just agreed
                                that Fockema should go Indonesia. Simatupang and other Indonesian
                                leaders stressed necessity military observers remaining to observe
                                withdrawals at least until transfer sovereignty. They thought
                                military observers might also help thereafter depending upon how far
                                Netherlands withdrawals may be accomplished by transfer date and how
                                much difficulty may be experienced with dissident elements. Believe
                                therefore any decision toward cutting down or withdrawing military
                                observers should be postponed.</p>
                            <p>Sumitro expects return US November 11, remain there one week and then
                                go Indonesia. After surveying situation Indonesia hopes accompany
                                Djuanda on special mission to US, of which I had not previously
                                heard. I shall ask Hatta directly about this. Stikker mentioned
                                question announcement <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid. Said
                                it really did not matter to him whether it came today or few days
                                later. This should depend upon results his Embassy’s talks with
                                Department. He thought US should consult with Netherlands before
                                extending any financial assistance Indonesia. I gave no undertakings
                                but told him I had made no commitments on loans to Indonesians.
                                Simply had said I would help see what could be done when I go US. I
                                did state, however, I was sure US did not intend be least bit
                                reckless. Signed Cochran.</p>

                                    n="1" xml:id="d390fn1">Dated November 4, not printed.</note> in
                                which the Netherlands Government expresses its appreciation of Mr.
                                Cochran’s work on the Indonesian case.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador van Kleffens then discussed several matters of “past
                                history”. He remarked that while he had not always seen eye to eye
                                with us on the Indonesian problem, he felt that we had always been
                                in agreement on the end result to be sought—namely, a stable,
                                orderly, and independent Indonesia. He then remarked that he thought
                                that order and stability would have been better assured had the
                                Dutch been allowed to “complete” their last police action without
                                interference from the Security Council.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador did not mention our press release of yesterday<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d390fn2">Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                                we congratulated the parties, but in answer to a question from me
                                regarding the best way to handle the item of Indonesia on the agenda
                                of the General Assembly, he said that he judged that his government
                                and people were not in a mood to be congratulated, and felt that a
                                resolution by the General Assembly to congratulate the parties would
                                be misunderstood in Holland. On the subject of New Guinea, which I
                                raised, he said he felt that we should commence immediately to help
                                persuade the Indonesians that New Guinea should remain under Dutch
                                administration. I told him that we considered the Dutch position on
                                New Guinea a reasonable one, but that perhaps we had best let things
                                settle down a bit before working on this.</p>
                            <p>In answer to another question, Ambassador van Kleffens said that he
                                thought the most helpful thing we could do would be to continue to
                                impress upon the Indonesians the necessity of “putting their own
                                house in order”.</p>
                            <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0579"/>
                            <p>I thanked Ambassador van Kleffens for his note concerning Mr. Cochran
                                and told him that while we appreciated the difficulties that lay
                                ahead not only in Indonesia but in Holland, we felt that his
                                government had acted wisely and we for our part were prepared to
                                help make the arrangements of The Hague Agreement work out in

                            <p>Mr. Soedjatmoko called at his request bringing with him Mr. Abikusno
                                whom he identified to me privately as the most powerful leader <pb
                                    n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0582"/>of the Darul Islam. Mr.
                                Abikusno is to return to Indonesia on Monday, having spent some time
                                in Surinam, in contact with Islamic leaders there.</p>
                            <p>I opened the conversation by soliciting Mr. Soedjatmoko’s reaction to
                                the agreement reached at the Round Table Conference at The Hague.
                                Mr. Soedjatmoko deferred to Mr. Abikusno, explaining that Mr.
                                Abikusno would have to convince his followers of the justice of the
                                settlement. Questioning revealed that Mr. Abikusno considered the
                                agreement probably unsatisfactory to his constituents in two
                                particulars: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the acceptance of the
                                Netherlands Crown as a symbol of the Union, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) the assumption of debt by the Indonesian State in a
                                larger sum than they had desired. Mr. Nolting told Mr. Abikusno that
                                the Department considered the settlement remarkably favorable to the
                                Indonesians; that the debt provisions were particularly favorable to
                                the Indonesians in that the Netherlands had been obliged to concede
                                one and ½ billion guilders to achieve agreement; and that of the 4.3
                                billion guilders assumed by the Indonesians, all but 1.3 was
                                internal debt which any successor state must be expected to assume
                                from its predecessor. Mr. Abikusno seemed impressed.</p>
                            <p>I then showed Mr. Abikusno and Mr. Soedjatmoko the press statements
                                on the Indonesian settlement by the Secretary and Senator
                                    Graham<note n="1" xml:id="d393fn1">November 3, Department of

                                satisfaction expressing particular pleasure with paragraphs 2, 5,
                                and 6 of the Secretary’s statement. He explained that Dr. Hatta’s
                                predecessor, Sjafruddin [Communist traitor in September 1948]<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d393fn2">Brackets in the source text.</note> had
                                clapped him in jail for nine months because of his anti-Communist
                                activities. He added that Islam and Communism were absolutely
                                incompatible and Islam would continue to fight Communism in every
                                way it thought effective.</p>
                            <p>There followed a long discussion of the significance of Paragraph 5
                                of the Secretary’s press statement. Mr. Nolting and I explained that
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> would be resumed and we
                                discussed with the Indonesians the composition of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> program. It was agreed that the
                                commodities most urgently needed within the next few months, in
                                order of preference, in Indonesia were: (1) textiles, (2) rice, (3)
                                transportation items and (4) agricultural instruments.</p>
                            <p>The Indonesians made general inquiry of the functioning of the
                                Export-Import Bank. It was explained to them that the Bank advanced
                                loans against specific projects which must be proved
                                self-liquidating; that there was no application for a loan to
                                Indonesia outstanding at the present time; and that the United
                                States would take no action on a loan to Indonesia through the
                                Export-Import Bank or <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0583"/>any
                                other agency until the Indonesian State had made formal application.
                                I further explained that the United States was determined to avoid
                                even the appearance of what our enemy described as “financial
                                imperialism” and would not therefore press financial assistance upon
                                the Indonesian State in any form. I went on to say that the United
                                States Government was of the view that loans to Indonesia should be
                                made on a strictly bankable proposition and that I thought the
                                Indonesian State would find this politically advantageous since they
                                could thereby refute any charge that they were accepting political
                                financing from the United States. At this point both Mr. Soedjatmoko
                                and Mr. Abikusno showed lively approval of this policy and Mr.
                                Abikusno said that he thought this attitude on the part of the
                                Department of State would be most useful to him in his efforts to
                                “sell” the Hague Agreement to Darul Islam.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Abikusno then stated that the Indonesian State desired, above all
                                things, American technicians in Indonesia and the education of young
                                Indonesians in the United States. He was told that the United States
                                Government was particularly eager that Indonesians come to the
                                United States on scholarship exchanges and that the United States
                                would make every possible contribution to relieve the present dearth
                                of technical skill in Indonesia. He was reminded, however, that the
                                United States had many calls upon its limited exportable complement
                                of technicians. Moreover that the schedule of pay for American
                                technicians was relatively high. Mr. Nolting and I expressed the
                                hope that the Indonesian State would therefore make the fullest
                                possible use of Dutch technicians on an employee basis. After much
                                discussion it seemed clear that Mr. Abikusno harbored considerable
                                resentment against the Dutch; that he would not encourage
                                Indonesians to go to school in the Netherlands nor would he abandon
                                his conviction that English should be the second language in
                                Indonesia rather than Dutch. He was agreed, however, that the
                                Indonesians should make full use of Netherlands technical and
                                administrative experience. [Three of Mr. Abikusno’s sons were
                                executed by the Netherlands military in his presence.]<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d393fn3">Brackets in the source text.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>Mr. Nolting and I took this occasion to explain the Department’s hope
                                that the Statute of the Union would enable the Indonesian and Dutch
                                people to discover anew their dependence on each other. It was
                                apparent that however much or little Mr. Abikusno was impressed with
                                this part of U.S. policy toward Indonesia, he was visibly impressed
                                by the absence of American ambitions in the area.</p>
                            <p>During the course of conversation, Mr. Abikusno referred several
                                times to the urgent need for a rehabilitation of the communications
                                    <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0584"/>and transportation
                                system in Indonesia. He said that he, as an architect, was eager to
                                consult with American architects on prefabricated housing. I placed
                                him in touch with Jacob L. Crane, Adviser to the Administrator of
                                the Housing and Home Finance Agency.</p>
                            <p>Toward the end of the conversation, Mr. Abikusno expressed great
                                satisfaction with the course of the interview and said that it
                                should help him on his return to Indonesia to explain the
                                sympathetic and unselfish attitude of the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Abikusno said in an aside to Mr. Nolting that he realized the
                                creation and maintenance of law and order in Indonesia was the
                                Indonesian Government’s first concern.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Soedjatmoko remained behind for a brief moment after Mr.
                                Abikusno’s departure to say that he thought Mr. Abikusno had been

                                implementation of <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> agreements. In
                                brief the fol are primary reasons:</p>
                            <p>(1) It is important for beneficial effect upon ratification and
                                implementation of Hague agreements and prospects for internal
                                stability in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> fol transfer of
                                sovereignty that primary UN action be to express gratification and
                                approval of conduct of parties in achieving the current settlement.
                                This objective might needlessly be jeopardised if extensive debate
                                were to take place now upon precise terms of future functions of UN
                                Commission in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>, involving
                                probable differences of opinion not only between Soviet and Western
                                    <gloss target="#t_reps1">reps</gloss> but also between <gloss

                                members.</p>
                            <p>(2) As <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> reports indicate,
                                there is still a substantial job ahead for <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>, and terms of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Jan 28 <gloss target="#t_res1"
                                    >res</gloss> are broad enough to permit continuation <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> functions under terms of
                                reference delineated Jan 28. (See <gloss target="#t_Ushic1"
                                    >Ushic</gloss> 20, Sept 29, 1949.) (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) If
                                question is raised, it is US view that Para 116 of <gloss

                                “recommendation” to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> under Para
                                4(c) of Jan 28 <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss> that <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> continue without change in
                                terms of reference. Reason for continuation <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> after transfer of sovereignty
                                is that under current agreement several aspects of settlement, e.g.,
                                elections, will be carried out after transfer instead of prior to,
                                as generally contemplated before accelerated transfer plan was
                                agreed upon by parties. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Further, it wld
                                be difficult technically for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to
                                evaluate now performance of <gloss target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss>
                                under Jan 28 <gloss target="#t_res1">res</gloss> because two <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCFIN1">UNCFI</gloss> reports do not cover all of

                                delineated then. In the main these reports describe Batavia
                                Agreements re cease-fire, etc. and Hague Agreements re transfer of

                                particular there is as yet no report to the <pb n="575"

                                speaking with Stikker who said he had so far had no formal talks
                                with <gloss target="#t_Repubs1">Repubs</gloss> but would proceed
                                today to Jogja to meet with top leaders. He said object trip was to
                                reassure himself on probabilities law and order Indonesia so that he
                                might be able to report to Parliamentary commissions Hague. In view
                                probable debate on <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> ratification
                                on December 5 in Hague, he is returning Saturday but Schaik will
                                remain in Indonesia until mid December.</p>
                            <p>Stikker said he thought Second Chamber approval <gloss

                                should be borne in mind that First Chamber approval also necessary
                                and he less confident favorable action by First Chamber although he
                                did not seem seriously to doubt this. I did not discuss <pb n="579"
                                    xml:id="pg_579" facs="0593"/>this latter point with Stikker but
                                spoke later with Gieben who said he thought First Chamber approval
                                might be difficult to secure but that there was no doubt in his mind
                                as to favorable action. Gieben mentioned over-riding influence which
                                Crown could exert if necessary on First Chamber, adding that it was
                                known that Queen Juliana desired Parliamentary approval re <gloss

                                Roem at meeting again praised <gloss target="#t_UNCI1">UNCI</gloss>
                                role at <gloss target="#t_RTC1">RTC</gloss> and emphasized desire

                            <p>At meeting, three joint subcommittees were established to carry on

                            <p>During past few days, several informal meetings of above groups have

                            <p>Roem told Australian deputy today that Jogja considering as first

                                had strong support partly owing his known international negotiating
                                ability and partly because this would keep him from acting as

                            <p>Mr. Helb and Mr. Sadarpo called by appointment in order to announce
                                the transfer of sovereignty by the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the
                                Republic of the United States of Indonesia on December 27, 1949.
                                Their call marked a historic occasion of considerable significance
                                in the development of new nations in the Far East as the United
                                States of Indonesia will be the second largest Moslem nation in the
                                world, second only to Pakistan.</p>
                            <p>The atmosphere of the new situation was signalized by the fact that
                                Messrs. Helb and Sadarpo came together as friends to make the
                                announcement, with Mr. Sadarpo acting as spokesman. This seemed
                                symbolic of the future relations between the Netherlands and the
                                United States of Indonesia and was a fulfillment of United States
                                policy during the past three years when the concept of the mutual
                                need of the Netherlands and of Indonesia for each other was
                                repeatedly emphasized to both.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sadarpo extended an invitation to the Government of the United
                                States of America to be represented at the ceremonies in Indonesia
                                on December 27. He apologized for the inadequate accommodations at
                                Batavia indicating, for example, their difficulties in providing
                                flagstaffs for visiting guests. He expressed the hope that their
                                physical limitations would be overlooked. He stated that he was
                                disappointed in not being able to extend a similar invitation to Mr.
                                H. Merle Cochran as United States representative of the United
                                Nations Delegation. He explained that he had been prevented by Mr.
                                Cochran’s departure before authorization to extend the invitation
                                had been received. I assured Mr. Sadarpo that I would telegraph this
                                invitation to Mr. Cochran in his behalf.</p>
                            <p>I expressed my gratification to Messrs. Sadarpo and Helb at this
                                historic development and said that all officers in the United States
                                Government who had been concerned with the recent negotiations would
                                similarly feel profound pleasure at the prospects for the
                                future.</p>

                            <p>At this point Mr. Sadarpo left to catch a plane to New York and Mr.
                                Helb remained to hand me a copy of a note which will be presented
                                tomorrow by the Netherlands Ambassador to the Secretary to the
                                effect that the Netherlands Government would formally recognize the
                                United States of Indonesia as an independent and sovereign state in
                                a ceremony at Amsterdam on December 27, and expressed the hope that
                                the Government of the United States of America would similarly
                                recognize the new state after the transfer of sovereignty. Mr. Helb
                                repeated that this was an advance notice which would be formalized
                                tomorrow.</p>

                                Queen’s address, which Stikker informed me written by herself, very
                                human in its appeal to two countries to forget past differences,
                                accept solution and strive earnestly “to cooperate loyally in the
                                new system”. After stating readiness of Netherlands “to render
                                assistance as soon as and when Indonesia should ask for it,” address
                                concluded with these extraordinary words: “It is a privilege to
                                perform this act of transfer as it stands in history, or rather in
                                the face of God, who knows why this march hand-in-hand in freedom
                                was not achieved sooner nor later, and who knows the feelings of
                                generations, but who also watches whether we can use this plan for
                                the progress of mankind. May this now be so”.</p>

                                currently in force between the two countries. At the time of
                                signing, it was the hope of this Government that Article XIII of the
                                Agreement would provide satisfactory criminal jurisdiction for
                                offenses against the United States.</p>
                            <p>In the intervening two years, however, a condition of lawlessness in
                                the Philippines, as evidenced by numerous acts of violence against
                                United States personnel and property, has grown to serious
                                proportions. I enclose for your information copies of two reports
                                prepared in 1948 by the Commanding General, Philippine-Ryukyus
                                Command, United States Army and the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces,
                                    Philippines,<note n="2" xml:id="d416fn2">Dated May 10, 1948, and
                                    July 6, 1948, neither printed.</note> to indicate the nature and
                                extent of the offenses to which I refer, as well as the measures
                                taken by these commanders to cope with this situation.</p>
                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the matter at length. They
                                consider that from a military viewpoint these acts of violence do
                                not in themselves affect the security of the United States, but that
                                they do seriously hamper the proper conduct of the affairs of our
                                armed forces in the Philippines, and also affect adversely the
                                security of armed <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0607"/>forces
                                personnel and Government property in the Philippines. The Joint
                                Chiefs believe, and I agree, that this situation is principally the
                                result of reluctance by Philippine authorities to enforce their own
                                criminal laws in the case of offenses against the personnel and
                                propery of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended that the Philippine
                                Government be requested to bring about more adequate enforcement of
                                its criminal laws, and I accordingly ask you to make formal
                                representations in this connection. I recognize that a variety of
                                factors may contribute to anti-United States sentiment in the
                                Philippines, in which this Goverment may not be entirely without
                                fault. However, I think you will agree that the incidents cited by
                                the Army and Navy commanders reflect failure by the Philippine
                                Republic properly to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement, and
                                may therefore be made the subject of direct representation by the
                                Department of State.</p>
                            <p>Article I, Section 4 of the Military Bases Agreement states that an
                                exact description of the bases listed in the Agreement “will be
                                agreed upon between the appropriate authorities of the two
                                Governments as soon as possible”. The lack of exact metes and bounds
                                has proved a source of conflict between United States and Philippine
                                jurisdiction. I wish to emphasize the importance of concluding an
                                agreement on this matter during the current negotiations which I
                                understand are now in progress in the Philippines.</p>
                            <p>For your information, the Secretary of the Army is formulating
                                proposals for a revision of Article XIII of the Military Bases
                                Agreement, in the event that conditions do not improve. The
                                Department of State would then be a position to negotiate on this
                                queston with the Philippine Republic at such time as you may deem
                                politically appropriate. However, I believe that the United States
                                Government should, as a matter of urgency, make representations now
                                to the Philippine Government concerning lax criminal prosecution
                                under the Military Bases Agreement in its current form.</p>

                                        the present Philippine Administration may feel that it is

                                        arises the Philippine Government need not be pressed for a
                                        decision on the outstanding issues at the present

                                        be pressed for a decision on all of the outstanding treaty

                                    <item>The Embassy should be mindful of the importance which the
                                            <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> attaches to the
                                        principles set forth in the draft treaty of <gloss
                                            target="#t_FCN1">FCN</gloss> which has been proposed to
                                        the Philippines. These principles are the basis of this
                                        Government’s foreign economic policy. They are directed
                                        toward the objective of placing world trade on a
                                        multilateral nondiscriminatory basis and of providing the
                                        maximum protection for the rights and interests of American
                                        nationals and companies abroad consistent with the treatment
                                        which the US can accord aliens on a reciprocal basis. They
                                        are found in commitments which the US has made with many
                                        countries and are involved in commitments likely to be
                                        proposed to many other countries. Any major deviation from
                                        these principles is therefore undesirable, and rather than
                                        to accept any fundamental change, the <gloss
                                            target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> probably would prefer to

                            <p>The Secretary of State transmits a copy of a letter to the Secretary
                                of State from the Secretary of Defense dated April 19, 1949
                                regarding acts of violence against personnel of the armed forces in
                                the Philippines. A copy of the Department’s reply<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d419fn1">Not printed.</note> is also attached for the
                                information and guidance of the Embassy. The Department desires that
                                the Embassy lend all possible cooperation and support to the
                                representatives of the National Military Establishment in the
                                Philippines where, in the opinion of the Embassy, either the
                                jurisdiction clauses of the Military Bases Agreement are not being
                                observed or the Philippine Government does not display a disposition
                                to enforce its own criminal laws. As stated in the letter to the
                                Secretary of Defense, the <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0610"

                                Philippines. In view of the very delicate and troublesome nature of
                                this problem, consultation with the Department is desired before
                                taking action on border line cases and for the records of the
                                Department a complete report of all cases which arise is
                                desired.</p>
                            <p>The Department would also appreciate receiving any information
                                available on the current status of the project for delimiting the

                            <p>“I wish to thank you all for seeing me off. I am going to Washington
                                officially as President of the Philippines. I shall be received
                                there in that capacity. The name Elpidio Quirino is only incidental
                                to official title. I have a delicate mission to perform. Its
                                significance and importance to the welfare and stability of our
                                country and people and to the relations between the Philippines and
                                the United States are far-reaching. I must make it plain that I am
                                not going merely to ask or beg. In honor and dignity as befits our
                                sovereign status, I will, as your spokesman, convey your message of
                                good-will and gratitude to the American people.</p>
                            <p>There are many spiritual and moral ties that bind us to America. It
                                is necessary that we cultivate them. This is part of my mission.
                                This is not a political junket. At this juncture in our history, it
                                is imperative that your President should make this trip. While I am
                                away, may I plead to all and sundry to hold your peace and maintain
                                your serenity and calm. Above all, I wish you all to forget that I
                                am a candidate. You can say what you please on that score when I
                                come back.</p>
                            <p>I ask you to leave aside for the moment our partisan political
                                differences and help me concentrate on the interest of our country
                                while abroad. I rely on the high minded loyalty and devotion of
                                every <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0611"/>Filipino, to his

                                mission. If you cannot pray for my personal safety, please pray at
                                least for the safety of our national interests which I carry deep in
                                my heart.</p>

                            <p>President Truman brought up the question of the financial budgetary
                                situation of the Philippine Government, making reference to the
                                report of the Joint Philippine-American Finance Commission, and
                                inquired as to the progress being made by the Philippine Government
                                in implementing the recommendations of the Commission. He made it
                                clear that this government was somewhat concerned at the future
                                outlook of the Philippine Government and their ability to get their
                                finances and currency on a sound and stable basis. Secretary Pedrosa
                                replied for President Quirino indicating that they were aware of the
                                importance of this question and were trying to do everything
                                possible to get their financial house in order.</p>
                            <p>There was some discussion of the peace and order situation throughout
                                the country generally but with specific reference to the area around
                                Clark Field and the so-called Huk territory in central Luzon.
                                President Quirino was informed that this government was concerned
                                that the military authorities were compelled to take unusual
                                precautions to try to protect their personnel at Clark Field.
                                President Quirino stated in reply that they were rapidly bringing
                                the Huk movement under control; that the number of these people who
                                had been involved <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0612"/>in the
                                Huk movement had been cut down to a point where they were no longer
                                a source of worry.</p>
                            <p>Presidents Quirino raised the question of possible additional
                                benefits for Philippine veterans, reminding President Truman that he
                                (President Truman) had previously endorsed certain legislation upon
                                which Congress had failed to take action. President Truman confirmed
                                this, saying that he had been strongly in sympathy with this
                                proposal but that he had not been able to get Congress to take
                                favorable action, and he made no commitment that he would undertake
                                to try to do so again.</p>
                            <p>President Quirino also raised the question as to the possibility of
                                further recognition of (Philippine guerrilas but President Truman
                                told him definitely that this matter had been carefully considered
                                and the issue was closed as far as the United States was concerned.
                                President Quirino then asked Prudent Truman not to make a public
                                statement to that effect as he (President Quirino) had appointed a
                                board to make a study of the problem and that the Philippine
                                Government might undertake to do something for the guerrillas with
                                its own resources.</p>
                            <p>President Quirino and the members of his staff then brought up a new
                                question which had not been anticipated. They referred to an
                                executive order issued by the Philippine Government during the war
                                relating to pay of Filipino soldiers which was apparently intended
                                to fix pay scales of Filipino soldiers on a par with American
                                troops. As Army refused to accept, this order was never implemented
                                and the Philippine Government now wishes to reopen the question. The
                                matter was discussed only briefly, with no encouragement given by
                                President Truman.</p>
                            <p>President Quirino made a strong plea for military assistance and for
                                the appropriation of further funds for the payment of war damages,
                                arguing that the United States Government, by public announcements
                                early in the war, had a commitment particularly on the War damage
                                question. President Truman was noncommittal on both questions,
                                saying that they were still under consideration but he remarked that
                                on any such programs involving expenditure of additional United
                                States’ funds it was a cause of concern that this money would be
                                largely wasted unless the Philippine Government put its financial
                                house in order. It was at this point that President Quirino
                                countered with the argument that the United States was committed on
                                these two matters.</p>
                            <p>President Quirino raised the question of the extent to which the
                                Philippines might expect to participate in the Point Font program
                                and President Truman explained what his original concept of the <pb
                                    n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0613"/>Point Four program was but
                                that he could not at this time tell President Quirino what the
                                United States would be able to do.</p>
                            <p>President Quirino brought up the question of the appropriation of
                                23.8 million dollars authorized to be appropriated in 1934 to
                                reimburse the Philippine Government for losses arising from the
                                devaluation of the dollar, again taking the position that this
                                government had an obligation to make this money available. President
                                Truman remarked that he remembered the debates on this question in
                                the Senate and referred particularly to strong opposition by the
                                late Senator Glass of Virginia, intimating that he thought there
                                might be opposition in Congress to taking any action on the
                                question, but he threw out the suggestion that the Philippine
                                Government might wish to try to offset this claim against funds owed
                                to the United States and Secretary Pedrosa said that they had had
                                the same idea.</p>

                            <p>2962. Principal foreign diplomatic consular officers, Manila, called
                                in body on Quirino afternoon December 29 offer congratulations on
                                his inauguration. In course this call Quirino made to me following
                                statements re his forthcoming visit US:</p>
                            <p>He will leave Manila by regular Philippine Airlines’ plane January 5
                                accompanied by members family and probably also by one or two
                                secretaries but by none of top government officials. Plane will fly
                                New York without touching Washington. At New York he will board <pb
                                    n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0614"/>another plane for Baltimore
                                (Embassy will transmit flight schedule and list members official
                                party soon as available).</p>
                            <p>President asked I make completely clear purpose his trip is receive
                                medical attention Johns Hopkins and that he expects no official
                                entertaining or other official notice taken of his trip except that
                                he would appreciate opportunity call on Truman either before

                                prefer (I would suggest he be invited for small informal lunch or
                                dinner with Truman at which it would be desirable for Secretary of
                                State and Secretary of Treasury be present).</p>
                            <p>Incidentally, Quirino informed us he proposes keep his concurrent
